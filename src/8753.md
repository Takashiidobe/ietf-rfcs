# RFC 8753 {#rfcnum}

# Internationalized Domain Names for Applications (IDNA) Review for New Unicode Versions {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

The standards for Internationalized Domain Names in Applications (IDNA)
require a review of each new version of Unicode to determine whether
incompatibilities with prior versions or other issues exist and, where
appropriate, to allow the IETF to decide on the trade-offs between
compatibility with prior IDNA versions and compatibility with Unicode
going forward. That requirement, and its relationship to tables
maintained by IANA, has caused significant confusion in the past. This
document makes adjustments to the review procedure based on experience
and updates IDNA, specifically RFC 5892, to reflect those changes and to
clarify the various relationships involved. It also makes other minor
adjustments to align that document with
experience.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

The standards for Internationalized Domain Names in Applications (IDNA)
require a review of each new version of Unicode to determine whether
incompatibilities with prior versions or other issues exist and, where
appropriate, to allow the IETF to decide on the trade-offs between
compatibility with prior IDNA versions and compatibility with Unicode
\[[Unicode](#Unicode){.xref}\] going forward. That requirement, and its
relationship to tables maintained by IANA, has caused significant
confusion in the past (see [Section 3](#ReviewModel){.xref} and [Section
4](#IDNA-Assumptions){.xref} for additional discussion of the question
of appropriate decisions and the history of these reviews). This
document makes adjustments to the review procedure based on nearly a
decade of experience and updates IDNA, specifically the document that
specifies the relationship between Unicode code points and IDNA derived
properties \[[RFC5892](#RFC5892){.xref}\], to reflect those changes and
to clarify the various relationships
involved.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

This specification does not change the requirement that registries at
all levels of the DNS tree take responsibility for the labels they
insert in the DNS, a level of responsibility that requires allowing only
a subset of the code points and strings allowed by the IDNA protocol
itself. That requirement is discussed in more detail in a companion
document
\[[RegRestr](#I-D.klensin-idna-rfc5891bis){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

Terminology note: In this document, \"IDNA\" refers to the current
version as described in [RFC 5890](#RFC5890){.xref}
\[[RFC5890](#RFC5890){.xref}\] and subsequent documents and sometimes
known as \"IDNA2008\". Distinctions between it and the earlier version
are explicit only where they are necessary for understanding the
relationships involved, e.g., in [Section
2](#History){.xref}.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}
:::

::: {#History}
::: {#section-2 .section}
## [2.](#section-2){.section-number .selfRef} [Brief History of IDNA Versions, the Review Requirement, and RFC 5982](#name-brief-history-of-idna-versi){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-brief-history-of-idna-versi}

The original, now-obsolete, version of IDNA, commonly known as
\"IDNA2003\" \[[RFC3490](#RFC3490){.xref}\]
\[[RFC3491](#RFC3491){.xref}\], was defined in terms of a profile of a
collection of IETF-specific tables \[[RFC3454](#RFC3454){.xref}\] that
specified the usability of each Unicode code point with IDNA. Because
the tables themselves were normative, they were intrinsically tied to a
particular version of Unicode. As Unicode evolved, the IDNA2003 standard
would have required the creation of a new profile for each new version
of Unicode, or the tables would have fallen further and further
behind.[¶](#section-2-1){.pilcrow}

When IDNA2003 was superseded by the current version, known as IDNA2008
\[[RFC5890](#RFC5890){.xref}\], a different strategy, one that was
property-based rather than table-based, was adopted for a number of
reasons, of which the reliance on normative tables was not dominant
\[[RFC4690](#RFC4690){.xref}\]. In the IDNA2008 model, the use of
normative tables was replaced by a set of procedures and rules that
operated on Unicode properties
\[[Unicode-properties](#Unicode-properties){.xref}\] and a few internal
definitions to determine the category and status, and hence an
IDNA-specific \"derived property\", for any given code point. Those
rules are, in principle, independent of Unicode versions. They can be
applied to any version of Unicode, at least from approximately version
5.0 forward, to yield an appropriate set of derived properties. However,
the working group that defined IDNA2008 recognized that not all of the
Unicode properties were completely stable and that, because the criteria
for new code points and property assignment used by the Unicode
Consortium might not precisely align with the needs of IDNA, there were
possibilities of incompatible changes to the derived property values.
More specifically, there could be changes that would make previously
disallowed labels valid, previously valid labels disallowed, or that
would be disruptive to IDNA\'s defining rule structure. Consequently,
IDNA2008 provided for an expert review of each new version of Unicode
with the possibility of providing exceptions to the rules for particular
new code points, code points whose properties had changed, and newly
discovered issues with the IDNA2008 collection of rules. When problems
were identified, the reviewer was expected to notify the IESG. The
assumption was that the IETF would review the situation and modify
IDNA2008 as needed, most likely by adding exceptions to preserve
backward compatibility (see [Section
3.1](#AlgorReview){.xref}).[¶](#section-2-2){.pilcrow}

For the convenience of the community, IDNA2008 also provided that IANA
would maintain copies of calculated tables resulting from each review,
showing the derived properties for each code point. Those tables were
expected to be helpful, especially to those without the facilities to
easily compute derived properties themselves. Experience with the
community and those tables has shown that they have been confused with
the normative tables of IDNA2003: the IDNA2008 tables published by IANA
have never been normative, and statements about IDNA2008 being out of
date with regard to some Unicode version because the IANA tables have
not been updated are incorrect or
meaningless.[¶](#section-2-3){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-3 .section}
## [3.](#section-3){.section-number .selfRef} [The Review Model](#name-the-review-model){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-the-review-model}

While the text has sometimes been interpreted differently, IDNA2008
actually calls for two types of review when a new Unicode version is
introduced. One is an algorithmic comparison of the set of derived
properties calculated from the new version of Unicode to the derived
properties calculated from the previous one to determine whether
incompatible changes have occurred. The other is a review of newly
assigned code points to determine whether any of them require special
treatment (e.g., assignment of what IDNA2008 calls contextual rules) and
whether any of them violate any of the assumptions underlying the
IDNA2008 derived property calculations. Any of the cases of either
review might require either per-code point exceptions or other
adjustments to the rules for deriving properties that are part of RFC
5892. The subsections below provide a revised specification for the
review procedure.[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

Unless the IESG or the designated expert team concludes that there are
special problems or unusual circumstances, these reviews will be
performed only for major Unicode versions (those numbered NN.0, e.g.,
12.0) and not for minor updates (e.g., 12.1).[¶](#section-3-2){.pilcrow}

As can be seen in the detailed descriptions in the following
subsections, proper review will require a team of experts that has both
broad and specific skills in reviewing Unicode characters and their
properties in relation to both the written standards and operational
needs. The IESG will need to appoint experts who can draw on the broader
community to obtain the necessary skills for particular situations. See
the IANA Considerations ([Section 7](#IANA){.xref}) for
details.[¶](#section-3-3){.pilcrow}

### [3.1.](#section-3.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Review Model Part I: Algorithmic Comparison](#name-review-model-part-i-algorit){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-review-model-part-i-algorit}

Section
[5.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5892#section-5.1){.relref} of
RFC 5892 is the description of the process for creating the initial IANA
tables. It is noteworthy that, while it can be read as strongly implying
new reviews and new tables for versions of Unicode after 5.2, it does
not explicitly specify those reviews or, e.g., the timetable for
completing them. It also indicates that incompatibilities are to be
\"flagged for the IESG\" but does not specify exactly what the IESG is
to do about them and when. For reasons related to the other type of
review and discussed below, only one review was completed, documented
\[[RFC6452](#RFC6452){.xref}\], and a set of corresponding new tables
installed. That review, which was for Unicode 6.0, found only three
incompatibilities; the consensus was to ignore them (not create
exceptions in IDNA2008) and to remain consistent with computations based
on current (Unicode 6.0) properties rather than preserving backward
compatibility within IDNA. The 2018 review (for Unicode 11.0 and
versions in between it and 6.0)
\[[IDNA-Unicode12](#I-D.faltstrom-unicode12){.xref}\] also concluded
that Unicode compatibility, rather than IDNA backward compatibility,
should be maintained. That decision was partially driven by the long
period between reviews and the concern that table calculations by others
in the interim could result in unexpected incompatibilities if derived
property definitions were then changed. See [Section
4](#IDNA-Assumptions){.xref} for further discussion of these
preferences.[¶](#section-3.1-1){.pilcrow}

### [3.2.](#section-3.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Review Model Part II: New Code Point Analysis](#name-review-model-part-ii-new-co){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-review-model-part-ii-new-co}

The second type of review, which is not clearly explained in RFC 5892,
is intended to identify cases in which newly added or recently
discovered problematic code points violate the design assumptions of
IDNA, to identify defects in those assumptions, or to identify
inconsistencies (from an IDNA perspective) with Unicode commitments
about assignment, properties, and stability of newly added code points.
One example of this type of review was the discovery of new code points
after Unicode 7.0 that were potentially visually equivalent, in the same
script, to previously available code point sequences
\[[IAB-Unicode7-2015](#IAB-Unicode7-2015){.xref}\]
\[[IDNA-Unicode7](#I-D.klensin-idna-5892upd-unicode70){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3.2-1){.pilcrow}

Because multiple perspectives on Unicode and writing systems are
required, this review will not be successful unless it is done by a
team. Finding one all-knowing expert is improbable, and a single expert
is unlikely to produce an adequate analysis. Rather than any single
expert being the sole source of analysis, the designated expert (DE)
team needs to understand that there will always be gaps in their
knowledge, to know what they don\'t know, and to work to find the
expertise that each review requires. It is also important that the DE
team maintains close contact with the Area Directors (ADs) and that the
ADs remain aware of the team\'s changing needs, examining and adjusting
the team\'s membership over time, with periodic reexamination at least
annually. It should also be recognized that, if this review identifies a
problem, that problem is likely to be complex and/or involve multiple
trade-offs. Actions to deal with it are likely to be disruptive
(although perhaps not to large communities of users), or to leave
security risks (opportunities for attacks and inadvertent confusion as
expected matches do not occur), or to cause excessive reliance on
registries understanding and taking responsibility for what they are
registering \[[RFC5894](#RFC5894){.xref}\]
\[[RegRestr](#I-D.klensin-idna-rfc5891bis){.xref}\]. The latter, while a
requirement of IDNA, has often not worked out well in the
past.[¶](#section-3.2-2){.pilcrow}

Because resolution of problems identified by this part of the review may
take some time even if that resolution is to add additional contextual
rules or to disallow one or more code points, there will be cases in
which it will be appropriate to publish the results of the algorithmic
review and to provide IANA with corresponding tables, with warnings
about code points whose status is uncertain until there is IETF
consensus about how to proceed. The affected code points should be
considered unsafe and identified as \"under review\" in the IANA tables
until final derived properties are
assigned.[¶](#section-3.2-3){.pilcrow}

## [4.](#section-4){.section-number .selfRef} [IDNA Assumptions and Current Practice](#name-idna-assumptions-and-curren){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-idna-assumptions-and-curren}

At the time the IDNA2008 documents were written, the assumption was
that, if new versions of Unicode introduced incompatible changes, the
Standard would be updated to preserve backward compatibility for users
of IDNA. For most purposes, this would be done by adding to the table of
exceptions associated with Rule G
\[[RFC5892a](#RFC5892a){.xref}\].[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

This has not been the practice in the reviews completed subsequent to
Unicode 5.2, as discussed in [Section 3](#ReviewModel){.xref}.
Incompatibilities were identified in Unicode 6.0
\[[RFC6452](#RFC6452){.xref}\] and in the cumulative review leading to
tables for Unicode 11.0
\[[IDNA-Unicode11](#I-D.faltstrom-unicode11){.xref}\]. In all of those
cases, the decision was made to maintain compatibility with Unicode
properties rather than with prior versions of
IDNA.[¶](#section-4-2){.pilcrow}

If an algorithmic review detects changes in Unicode after version 12.0
that would break compatibility with derived properties associated with
prior versions of Unicode or changes that would preserve compatibility
within IDNA at the cost of departing from current Unicode
specifications, those changes must be captured in documents expected to
be published as Standards Track RFCs so that the IETF can review those
changes and maintain a historical record.[¶](#section-4-3){.pilcrow}

The community has now made decisions and updated tables for Unicode 6.0
\[[RFC6452](#RFC6452){.xref}\], done catch-up work between it and
Unicode 11.0 \[[IDNA-Unicode11](#I-D.faltstrom-unicode11){.xref}\], and
completed the review and tables for Unicode 12.0
\[[IDNA-Unicode12](#I-D.faltstrom-unicode12){.xref}\]. The decisions
made in those cases were driven by preserving consistency with Unicode
and Unicode property changes for reasons most clearly explained by the
IAB \[[IAB-Unicode-2018](#IAB-Unicode-2018){.xref}\]. These actions were
not only at variance with the language in RFC 5892 but were also
inconsistent with commitments to the registry and user communities to
ensure that IDN labels that were once valid under IDNA2008 would remain
valid, and previously invalid labels would remain invalid, except for
those labels that were invalid because they contained unassigned code
points.[¶](#section-4-4){.pilcrow}

This document restores and clarifies that original language and intent:
absent extremely strong evidence on a per-code point basis that
preserving the validity status of possible existing (or prohibited)
labels would cause significant harm, Unicode changes that would affect
IDNA derived properties are to be reflected in IDNA exceptions that
preserve the status of those labels. There is one partial exception to
this principle. If the new code point analysis (see [Section
3.2](#CodePointReview){.xref}) concludes that some code points or
collections of code points should be further analyzed, those code
points, and labels including them, should be considered unsafe and used
only with extreme caution because the conclusions of the analysis may
change their derived property values and
status.[¶](#section-4-5){.pilcrow}

## [5.](#section-5){.section-number .selfRef} [Derived Tables Published by IANA](#name-derived-tables-published-by){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-derived-tables-published-by}

As discussed above, RFC 5892 specified that derived property tables be
provided via an IANA registry. Perhaps because most IANA registries are
considered normative and authoritative, that registry has been the
source of considerable confusion, including the incorrect assumption
that the absence of published tables for versions of Unicode later than
6.0 meant that IDNA could not be used with later versions. That position
was raised in multiple ways, not all of them consistent, especially in
the ICANN context
\[[ICANN-LGR-SLA](#ICANN-LGR-SLA){.xref}\].[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

If the changes specified in this document are not successful in
significantly mitigating the confusion about the status of the tables
published by IANA, serious consideration should be given to eliminating
those tables entirely.[¶](#section-5-2){.pilcrow}

B](#ExpertRationale){.xref}. In both cases, the experts should draw on
the expertise of other members of the community as needed. In
particular, and especially if there is no overlap of the people holding
the various roles, coordination with the IAB-appointed liaison to the
Unicode Consortium will be essential to mitigate possible errors due to
confusion.[¶](#section-7-1){.pilcrow}

As discussed in [Section 5](#IANATables){.xref}, IANA has modified the
IDNA tables collection \[[IANA-IDNA-Tables](#IANA-IDNA-Tables){.xref}\]
by identifying them clearly as non-normative, so that a \"current\" or
\"correct\" version of those tables is not implied, and by pointing to
this document for an explanation. IANA has published tables supplied by
the IETF for all Unicode versions through 11.0, retaining all older
versions and making them available. Newer tables will be constructed as
specified in this document and then made available by IANA. IANA has
changed the title of that registry from \"IDNA Parameters\", which is
misleading, to \"IDNA Rules and Derived Property
Values\".[¶](#section-7-2){.pilcrow}

The \"Note\" in that registry says:[¶](#section-7-3){.pilcrow}

> IDNA does not require that applications and libraries, either for
> registration/storage or lookup, support any particular version of
> Unicode. Instead, they are required to use derived property values
> based on calculations associated with whatever version of Unicode they
> are using elsewhere in the application or library. For the convenience
> of application and library developers and others, the IETF has
> supplied, and IANA maintains, derived property tables for several
> version of Unicode as listed below. It should be stressed that these
> are not normative in that, in principle, an application can do its own
> calculations and these tables can change as IETF understanding
> evolves. By contrast, the list of code points requiring contextual
> rules and the associated rules are normative and should be treated as
> updates to the list in RFC 5892.[¶](#section-7-4.1){.pilcrow}

As long as the intent is preserved, the text of that note may be changed
in the future at IANA\'s discretion.[¶](#section-7-5){.pilcrow}

IANA\'s attention is called to the introduction, in [Section
3.2](#CodePointReview){.xref}, of a temporary \"under review\" category
to the PVALID, DISALLOWED, etc., entries in the
tables.[¶](#section-7-6){.pilcrow}

Applying the procedures described in this document and understanding of
the clarifications it provides should reduce confusion about IDNA
requirements. Because past confusion has provided opportunities for bad
behavior, the effect of these changes should improve Internet security
to at least some small extent.[¶](#section-8-1){.pilcrow}

Because of the preference to keep the derived property value stable (as
specified in RFC 5892 and discussed in [Section
4](#IDNA-Assumptions){.xref}), the algorithm used to calculate those
derived properties does change as explained in [Section
3](#ReviewModel){.xref}. If these changes are not taken into account,
the derived property value will change, and the implications might have
negative consequences, in some cases with security implications. For
example, changes in the calculated derived property value for a code
point from either DISALLOWED to PVALID or from PVALID to DISALLOWED can
cause changes in label interpretation that would be visible and
confusing to end users and might enable
attacks.[¶](#section-8-2){.pilcrow}

## [Appendix A.](#section-appendix.a){.section-number .selfRef} [Summary of Changes to RFC 5892](#name-summary-of-changes-to-rfc-5){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-summary-of-changes-to-rfc-5}

Other than the editorial correction specified in [Section
6](#ApplyErratum){.xref}, all of the changes in this document are
concerned with the reviews for new versions of Unicode and with the IANA
Considerations in [Section
5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5892#section-5){.relref} of
\[[RFC5892](#RFC5892){.xref}\], particularly [Section
5.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5892#section-5.1){.relref} of
\[[RFC5892](#RFC5892){.xref}\]. Whether the changes are substantive or
merely clarifications may be somewhat in the eye of the beholder, so the
list below should not be assumed to be comprehensive. At a very high
level, this document clarifies that two types of review were intended
and separates them for clarity. This document also restores the original
(but so far unobserved) default for actions when code point derived
properties change. For this reason, this document effectively replaces
[Section
5.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5892#section-5.1){.relref} of
\[[RFC5892](#RFC5892){.xref}\] and adds or changes some text so that the
replacement makes better sense.[¶](#section-appendix.a-1){.pilcrow}

Changes or clarifications that may be considered important
include:[¶](#section-appendix.a-2){.pilcrow}

-   [Separated the new Unicode version review into two explicit parts
    and provided for different review methods and, potentially,
    asynchronous
    outcomes.[¶](#section-appendix.a-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-appendix.a-3.1}
-   [Specified a DE team, not a single designated expert, for the code
    point
    review.[¶](#section-appendix.a-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-appendix.a-3.2}
-   [Eliminated the de facto requirement for the (formerly single)
    designated expert to be the same person as the IAB\'s liaison to the
    Unicode Consortium, but called out the importance of
    coordination.[¶](#section-appendix.a-3.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-appendix.a-3.3}
-   [Created the \"Status\" field in the IANA tables to inform the
    community about specific potentially problematic code points. This
    change creates the ability to add information about such code points
    before IETF review is completed instead of having the review process
    hold up the use of the new Unicode
    version.[¶](#section-appendix.a-3.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-appendix.a-3.4}
-   [In part because Unicode is now on a regular one-year cycle rather
    than producing major and minor versions as needed, to avoid
    overloading the IETF\'s internationalization resources, and to avoid
    generating and storing IANA tables for trivial changes (e.g., the
    single new code point in Unicode 12.1), the review procedure is
    applied only to major versions of Unicode unless exceptional
    circumstances arise and are
    identified.[¶](#section-appendix.a-3.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-appendix.a-3.5}

::: {#ExpertRationale}
::: {#section-appendix.b .section}
## [Appendix B.](#section-appendix.b){.section-number .selfRef} [Background and Rationale for Expert Review Procedure for New Code Point Analysis](#name-background-and-rationale-fo){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-background-and-rationale-fo}

The expert review procedure for new code point analysis described in
[Section 3.2](#CodePointReview){.xref} is somewhat unusual compared to
the examples presented in the Guidelines for Writing IANA Considerations
\[[RFC8126](#RFC8126){.xref}\]. This appendix explains that choice and
provides the background for it.[¶](#section-appendix.b-1){.pilcrow}

Development of specifications to support use of languages and writing
systems other than English (and Latin script) \-- so-called
\"internationalization\" or \"i18n\" \-- has always been problematic in
the IETF, especially when requirements go beyond simple coding of
characters (e.g., [RFC 3629](#RFC3629){.xref}
\[[RFC3629](#RFC3629){.xref}\]) or simple identification of languages
(e.g., [RFC 3282](#RFC3282){.xref} \[[RFC3282](#RFC3282){.xref}\] and
the earlier [RFC 1766](#RFC1766){.xref} \[[RFC1766](#RFC1766){.xref}\]).
A good deal of specialized knowledge is required, knowledge that comes
from multiple fields and that requires multiple perspectives. The work
is not obviously more complex than routing, especially if one assumes
that routing work requires a solid foundation in graph theory or network
optimization, or than security and cryptography, but people working in
those areas are drawn to the IETF and people from the fields that bear
on internationalization typically are
not.[¶](#section-appendix.b-2){.pilcrow}

As a result, we have often thought we understood a problem, generated a
specification or set of specifications, but then have been surprised by
unanticipated (by the IETF) issues. We then needed to tune and often
revise our specification. The language tag work that started with RFC
1766 is a good example of this: broader considerations and requirements
led to later work and a much more complex and finer-grained system
\[[RFC5646](#RFC5646){.xref}\].[¶](#section-appendix.b-3){.pilcrow}

Work on IDNs further increased the difficulties because many of the
decisions that led to the current version of IDNA require understanding
the DNS, its constraints, and, to at least some extent, the commercial
market of domain names, including various ICANN
efforts.[¶](#section-appendix.b-4){.pilcrow}

The net result of these factors is that it is extremely unlikely that
the IESG will ever find a designated expert whose knowledge and
understanding will include everything that is
required.[¶](#section-appendix.b-5){.pilcrow}

Consequently, [Section 7](#IANA){.xref} and other discussions in this
document specify a DE team that is expected to have the broad
perspective, expertise, and access to information and community in order
to review new Unicode versions and to make consensus recommendations
that will serve the Internet well. While we anticipate that the team
will have one or more leaders, the structure of the team differs from
the suggestions given in [Section
5.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8126#section-5.2){.relref} of the
Guidelines for Writing IANA Considerations
\[[RFC8126](#RFC8126){.xref}\] since neither the team\'s formation nor
its consultation is left to the discretion of the designated expert, nor
is the designated expert solely accountable to the community. A team
that contains multiple perspectives is required, the team members are
accountable as a group, and any nontrivial recommendations require team
consensus. This also differs from the common practice in the IETF of
\"review teams\" from which a single member is selected to perform a
review: the principle for these reviews is team
effort.[¶](#section-appendix.b-6){.pilcrow}

This document was inspired by extensive discussions within the I18N
Directorate of the IETF Applications and Real-Time (ART) area in the
first quarter of 2019 about sorting out the reviews for Unicode 11.0 and
12.0. Careful reviews by [Joel Halpern]{.contact-name} and text
suggestions from [Barry Leiba]{.contact-name} resulted in some
clarifications.[¶](#section-appendix.c-1){.pilcrow}

Thanks to [Christopher Wood]{.contact-name} for catching some editorial
errors that persisted until rather late in the document\'s life cycle
and to [Benjamin Kaduk]{.contact-name} for catching and raising a number
of questions during Last Call. Some of the issues they raised have been
reflected in the document; others did not appear to be desirable
modifications after further discussion, but the questions were
definitely worth raising and
discussing.[¶](#section-appendix.c-2){.pilcrow}
