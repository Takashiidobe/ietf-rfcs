In scenarios where network configuration information becomes invalid
without any explicit signaling of that condition (such as when a
Customer Edge (CE) router crashes and reboots without knowledge of the
previously employed configuration information), hosts on the local
network will continue using stale information for an unacceptably long
period of time, thus resulting in connectivity problems. This problem is
documented in detail in
\[[RFC8978](#RFC8978){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

This document specifies improvements to CE routers that help mitigate
the aforementioned problem for residential and small office scenarios.
It specifies recommendations for the default behavior of CE routers but
does not preclude the availability of configuration knobs that might
allow an operator or user to manually configure the CE router to deviate
from these recommendations. This document updates RFC
7084.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

This section specifies and clarifies requirements for CE routers that
can help mitigate the problem discussed in [Section 1](#intro){.xref},
particularly when they employ prefixes learned via DHCPv6 Prefix
Delegation (DHCPv6-PD) \[[RFC8415](#RFC8415){.xref}\] on the WAN side
with Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC)
\[[RFC4862](#RFC4862){.xref}\] or DHCPv6 \[[RFC8415](#RFC8415){.xref}\]
on the LAN side. The recommendations in this document help improve
robustness at the CE router (on which the user or ISP may have no
control) and do not preclude implementation of host-side improvements
such as those specified in
\[[6MAN-SLAAC-RENUM](#I-D.ietf-6man-slaac-renum){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

This document specifies additional WAN-side prefix-delegation (WPD)
requirements to those specified in
\[[RFC7084](#RFC7084){.xref}\]:[¶](#section-3-2){.pilcrow}

WPD-10:
:   CE routers [MUST]{.bcp14} by default use a WAN-side Identity
    Association IDentifier (IAID) value that is stable between CE router
    restarts, DHCPv6 client restarts, or interface state changes (e.g.,
    transient PPP interfaces), unless the CE router employs the IAID
    techniques discussed in [Section

### [3.1.](#section-3.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Automatic DHCPv6 RELEASEs](#name-automatic-dhcpv6-releases){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-automatic-dhcpv6-releases}

Some CE routers are known to automatically send DHCPv6-PD RELEASE
messages upon restart events. However, this may inadvertently trigger a
flash-renumbering scenario, along with the associated problems discussed
in \[[RFC8978](#RFC8978){.xref}\], that this document attempts to
mitigate.[¶](#section-3.1-1){.pilcrow}

As a result, requirement WPD-9 from [Section 3](#CPE){.xref} specifies
that CE routers [SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} automatically send DHCPv6-PD
RELEASE messages upon restart events.[¶](#section-3.1-2){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC8415](#RFC8415){.xref}\] requires that the IAID for an IA
[MUST]{.bcp14} be consistent across restarts of the DHCP client.
However, some popular CE routers are known to select new random IAIDs,
e.g., every time the underlying PPP session is established or when the
device is rebooted. This could be the result of extrapolating the
behavior described in \[[RFC7844](#RFC7844){.xref}\] or simply a
consequence of not storing IAIDs on stable storage along with failure to
employ an algorithm that consistently generates the same IAID upon
reboots. Thus, requirement WPD-10 from [Section 3](#CPE){.xref} prevents
CE routers from inadvertently triggering flash-renumbering events on the
local network.[¶](#section-3.2-1){.pilcrow}

The \"Preferred Lifetime\" and \"Valid Lifetime\" of Prefix Information
Options (PIOs) \[[RFC4861](#RFC4861){.xref}\] corresponding to prefixes
learned via DHCPv6-PD on the WAN side [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} span past the
remaining preferred and valid lifetimes of the corresponding DHCPv6-PD
prefixes. This means that the \"Preferred Lifetime\" and the \"Valid
Lifetime\" advertised in PIOs by the CE router [MUST]{.bcp14} be
dynamically adjusted such that they never span past the remaining
preferred and valid lifetimes of the corresponding prefixes delegated
via DHCPv6-PD on the WAN side.[¶](#section-3.3-1){.pilcrow}

Similarly, the \"preferred-lifetime\" and \"valid-lifetime\" of DHCPv6
IA Address options and DHCPv6 IA Prefix options employed with DHCPv6 on
the LAN side [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} span past the remaining preferred and
valid lifetimes of the corresponding prefixes learned via DHCPv6-PD on
the WAN side. This means that the \"preferred-lifetime\" and
\"valid-lifetime\" of DHCPv6 IA Address options and DHCPv6 IA Prefix
options employed with DHCPv6 on the LAN side [MUST]{.bcp14} be

    from [Section

    \[[RFC8415](#RFC8415){.xref}\], which

CE routers [SHOULD]{.bcp14} override the default lifetime values of
Neighbor Discovery options that depend in any way on changes in the
prefix employed for address configuration on the LAN side, and employ
shorter lifetime values to improve the robustness to renumbering events,
while complying with the requirements from [Section
3.3](#dhcpv6-pd-slaac){.xref} of this document and the recommendations
in \[[RFC7772](#RFC7772){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3.4-1){.pilcrow}

CE routers [SHOULD]{.bcp14} set the \"Router Lifetime\" of Router
Advertisement (RA) messages to
ND_PREFERRED_LIMIT.[¶](#section-3.4-2){.pilcrow}

CE routers [SHOULD]{.bcp14} also set the PIO \"Preferred Lifetime\" to
the lesser of the remaining preferred lifetime of the corresponding
prefix (see [Section 3.3](#dhcpv6-pd-slaac){.xref}) and
ND_PREFERRED_LIMIT, and set the PIO \"Valid Lifetime\" to the lesser of
the remaining valid lifetime of the corresponding prefix and
ND_VALID_LIMIT. Additionally, the \"Route Lifetime\" of Route
Information Options (RIOs) \[[RFC4191](#RFC4191){.xref}\], the
\"Lifetime\" of Recursive DNS Server (RDNSS) options
\[[RFC8106](#RFC8106){.xref}\], and the \"Lifetime\" of DNS Search List
(DNSSL) options \[[RFC8106](#RFC8106){.xref}\] [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be set
to the lesser of the longest remaining valid lifetime of a prefix
(leased via DHCPv6 on the WAN side) and ND_VALID_LIMIT, if any of these
options are included in Router Advertisement
messages.[¶](#section-3.4-3){.pilcrow}

NOTE: In scenarios where the valid lifetime and the preferred lifetime
of prefixes learned via DHCPv6 on the WAN side are always larger than
ND_VALID_LIMIT and ND_PREFERRED_LIMIT, respectively, the lifetime values
advertised on the LAN side will not experience actual
changes.[¶](#section-3.4-4){.pilcrow}

The above text refers to the Neighbor Discovery options that are
typically employed by CE routers. A CE router may need to apply the same
policy for setting the lifetime of other Neighbor Discovery options it
employs, if and where applicable.[¶](#section-3.4-5){.pilcrow}

CE routers providing stateful address configuration via DHCPv6
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} set the \"preferred-lifetime\" of a DHCPv6 IA Address
option to the lesser of the remaining preferred lifetime of the
corresponding prefix (see [Section 3.3](#dhcpv6-pd-slaac){.xref}) and
ND_PREFERRED_LIMIT, and set the \"valid-lifetime\" of the same option to
the lesser of the remaining valid lifetime of the corresponding prefix
and ND_VALID_LIMIT.[¶](#section-3.4-6){.pilcrow}

CE routers providing DHCPv6-PD on the LAN side [SHOULD]{.bcp14} set the
\"preferred-lifetime\" of a DHCPv6 IA Prefix option to the lesser of the
remaining preferred lifetime of the corresponding prefix (see [Section

-   [IPv6 network renumbering is expected to take place in a planned
    manner with old/stale prefixes being phased out via reduced prefix
    lifetimes while new prefixes (with normal lifetimes) are introduced.
    However, a number of scenarios may lead to the so-called
    \"flash-renumbering\" events, where a prefix being employed on a
    network suddenly becomes invalid and replaced by a new prefix
    \[[RFC8978](#RFC8978){.xref}\]. One such scenario is when an
    Internet Service Provider (ISP) employs dynamic prefixes and the CE
    router crashes and reboots. The requirements in this section are
    meant to allow CE routers to deprecate stale information in such
    scenarios.[¶](#section-3.5-6.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.5-6.1}

-   [Hosts configuring addresses via SLAAC on the local network may
    employ addresses configured for the previously advertised prefixes
    for at most the \"Valid Lifetime\" of the corresponding PIOs of the
    last received Router Advertisement messages. Since Router
    Advertisement messages may be lost or fail to be received for
    various reasons, CE routers need to try to deprecate stale prefixes
    for a period of time equal to the \"Valid Lifetime\" of the PIO
    employed when originally advertising the
    prefix.[¶](#section-3.5-6.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.5-6.3}
-   [The requirements in this section to store information on stable
    storage are conveyed as \"[SHOULD]{.bcp14}\" (as opposed to
    \"[MUST]{.bcp14}\"), since they may represent a challenge for some
    implementations.[¶](#section-3.5-6.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.5-6.4}
-   [Advertising DHCPv6-leased prefixes with zero lifetimes on the LAN
    side would handle the case where a CE router has no stable storage
    but receives the prefixes via DHCPv6 with 0
    lifetimes.[¶](#section-3.5-6.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.5-6.5}

    is not going to assign an address or delegated prefix received as a
    hint in the Solicit message [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} include that address
    or delegated prefix in the Advertise message. Additionally, any
    subsequent Request messages will trigger the response specified in
