# RFC 9269 {#rfcnum}

# Experimental Scenarios of Information-Centric Networking (ICN) Integration in 4G Mobile Networks {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

A 4G mobile network uses IP-based transport for the control plane to
establish the data session at the user plane for the actual data
delivery. In the existing architecture, IP-based unicast is used for the
delivery of multimedia content to a mobile terminal, where each user is
receiving a separate stream from the server. From a bandwidth and
routing perspective, this approach is inefficient. Evolved multimedia
broadcast and multicast service (eMBMS) provides capabilities for
delivering contents to multiple users simultaneously, but its deployment
is very limited or at an experimental stage due to numerous challenges.
The focus of this document is to list the options for using
Information-Centric Networking (ICN) in 4G mobile networks and elaborate
the experimental setups for its further evaluation. The experimental
setups discussed provide guidance for using ICN either natively or with
an existing mobility protocol stack. With further investigations based
on the listed experiments, ICN with its inherent capabilities such as
network-layer multicast, anchorless mobility, security, and optimized
data delivery using local caching at the edge may provide a viable
alternative to IP transport in 4G mobile
networks.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

4G mobile technology is built as an all-IP network using routing
protocols (OSPF, IS-IS, BGP, etc.) to establish network routes. The
stickiness of an IP address to a device is the key to getting connected
to a mobile network. The same IP address is maintained through the
session until the device gets detached or moves to another
network.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

Key protocols used in 4G networks are the General Packet Radio Service
Tunneling Protocol (GTP), DIAMETER, and other protocols that are built
on top of IP. One of the biggest challenges with IP-based routing in 4G
is that it is not optimized for data transport. As an alternative to IP
routing, this document presents and lists the possible options for
integration of Information-Centric Networking (ICN) in 3GPP 4G mobile
networks, offering an opportunity to leverage inherent ICN capabilities
such as in-network caching, multicast, anchorless mobility management,
and authentication. This document also discusses how those options
affect mobile providers and end users.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

The goal of the proposed experiments is to present possibilities to
create simulated environments for evaluation of the benefits of ICN
protocol deployment in a 4G mobile network in different scenarios that
have been analyzed in this document. The consensus of the
Information-Centric Networking Research Group (ICNRG) is to publish this
document in order to facilitate experiments to show deployment options
and qualitative and quantitative benefits of ICN protocol deployment in
4G mobile networks.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

Access Point Name:
:   The Access Point Name (APN) is a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)
    and resolves to a set of gateways in an operator\'s network. An APN
    identifies the packet data network (PDN) with which a mobile data
    user wants to communicate. In addition to identifying a PDN, an APN
    may also be used to define the type of service, QoS, and other
    logical entities inside a Gateway General Packet Radio Service
    Support Node (GGSN) or a Packet Data Network Gateway
    (PGW).[¶](#section-2-1.2){.pilcrow}
:   

Control Plane:
:   The control plane carries signaling traffic and is responsible for
    routing between the eNodeB and the Mobile Management Entity (MME),
    the MME and the Home Subscriber Server (HSS), the MME and the Mobile
    Gateways (SGW/PGW), etc. Control plane signaling is required to
    authenticate and authorize the mobile terminal and establish a
    mobility session with Mobile Gateways (SGW/PGW). Control plane
    functions also include system configuration and
    management.[¶](#section-2-1.4){.pilcrow}
:   

Dual Address PDN/PDP Type:
:   The dual address Packet Data Network / Packet Data Protocol
    (PDN/PDP) Type (IPv4v6) is used in 3GPP context, in many cases as a
    synonym for dual stack, i.e., a connection type capable of serving
    IPv4 and IPv6 simultaneously.[¶](#section-2-1.6){.pilcrow}
:   

eNodeB:
:   The eNodeB is a base station entity that supports the Long Term
    Evolution (LTE) air interface.[¶](#section-2-1.8){.pilcrow}
:   

Evolved Packet Core:
:   The Evolved Packet Core (EPC) is an evolution of the 3GPP GPRS
    system characterized by a higher-data-rate, lower-latency,
    packet-optimized system. The EPC comprises some subcomponents of the
    EPS core such as MME, Mobile Gateways (SGW/PGW), and
    HSS.[¶](#section-2-1.10){.pilcrow}
:   

Evolved Packet System:
:   The Evolved Packet System (EPS) is an evolution of the 3GPP GPRS
    system characterized by a higher-data-rate, lower-latency,
    packet-optimized system that supports multiple Radio Access
    Technologies (RATs). The EPS comprises the EPC together with Evolved
    Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA) and the Evolved
    Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network
    (E-UTRAN).[¶](#section-2-1.12){.pilcrow}
:   

Evolved UTRAN:
:   The Evolved UTRAN (E-UTRAN) is a communications network sometimes
    referred to as 4G, and it consists of an eNodeB (4G base stations).
    The E-UTRAN allows connectivity between the User Equipment and the
    core network.[¶](#section-2-1.14){.pilcrow}
:   

Gateway GPRS Support Node:
:   The Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) is a gateway function in the
    GPRS and 3G network that provides connectivity to the Internet or
    other PDNs. The host attaches to a GGSN identified by an APN that is
    assigned to it by an operator. The GGSN also serves as the
    topological anchor for addresses/prefixes assigned to the User
    Equipment.[¶](#section-2-1.16){.pilcrow}
:   

General Packet Radio Service:
:   The General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) is a packet-oriented mobile
    data service available to users of the 2G and 3G cellular
    communication systems (the GSM) specified by
    3GPP.[¶](#section-2-1.18){.pilcrow}
:   

GPRS Tunneling Protocol:
:   The GPRS Tunneling Protocol (GTP) \[[TS29.060](#TS29.060){.xref}\]
    \[[TS29.274](#TS29.274){.xref}\] \[[TS29.281](#TS29.281){.xref}\] is
    a tunneling protocol defined by 3GPP. It is a network-based mobility
    protocol that works similarly to Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6).
    However, GTP also provides functionality beyond mobility, such as
    in-band signaling related to QoS and charging, among
    others.[¶](#section-2-1.20){.pilcrow}
:   

Home Subscriber Server:
:   The Home Subscriber Server (HSS) \[[TS29.336](#TS29.336){.xref}\] is
    a database for a given subscriber and was introduced in 3GPP Release
    5. It is the entity containing subscription-related information to
    support the network entities that handle
    calls/sessions.[¶](#section-2-1.22){.pilcrow}
:   

Mobile Terminal/User Equipment:
:   The terms User Equipment (UE), Mobile Station (MS), Mobile Node
    (MN), and mobile refer to the devices that are hosts with the
    ability to obtain Internet connectivity via a 3GPP network. An MS
    comprises the Terminal Equipment (TE) and an MT. The terms MT, MS,
    MN, and mobile are used interchangeably within this
    document.[¶](#section-2-1.24){.pilcrow}
:   

Mobility Management Entity:
:   The Mobility Management Entity (MME) is a network element
    responsible for control plane functionalities, including
    authentication, authorization, bearer management, Layer 2 mobility,
    and so on. The MME is essentially the control plane part of the SGSN
    in the GPRS. The user-plane traffic bypasses the
    MME.[¶](#section-2-1.26){.pilcrow}
:   

Packet Data Network:
:   The Packet Data Network (PDN) is a packet-based network that either
    belongs to the operator or is an external network such as the
    Internet or a corporate intranet. The user eventually accesses
    services in one or more PDNs. The operator\'s packet core networks
    are separated from packet data networks by either GGSNs or
    PGWs.[¶](#section-2-1.28){.pilcrow}
:   

Packet Data Network Gateway:
:   The Packet Data Network Gateway (PGW) is a gateway function in the
    EPS, which provides connectivity to the Internet or other PDNs. The
    host attaches to a PGW identified by an APN that is assigned to it
    by an operator. The PGW also serves as the topological anchor for
    addresses/prefixes assigned to the User
    Equipment.[¶](#section-2-1.30){.pilcrow}
:   

Packet Data Protocol Context:
:   A Packet Data Protocol (PDP) context is the equivalent of a virtual
    connection between the mobile terminal (MT) and a PDN using a
    specific gateway.[¶](#section-2-1.32){.pilcrow}
:   

Packet Data Protocol Type:
:   A Packet Data Protocol Type (PDP Type) identifies the used/allowed
    protocols within the PDP context. Examples are IPv4, IPv6, and
    IPv4v6 (dual stack).[¶](#section-2-1.34){.pilcrow}
:   

Policy and Charging Control:
:   The Policy and Charging Control (PCC) framework is used for QoS
    policy and charging control. It has two main functions: flow-based
    charging (including online credit control) and policy control (for
    example, gating control, QoS control, and QoS signaling). It is
    optional to 3GPP EPS but needed if dynamic policy and charging
    control by means of PCC rules based on user and services are
    desired.[¶](#section-2-1.36){.pilcrow}
:   

Public Land Mobile Network:
:   The Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) is a network operated by a
    single administration. A PLMN (and therefore also an operator) is
    identified by the Mobile Country Code (MCC) and the Mobile Network
    Code (MNC). Each (telecommunications) operator providing mobile
    services has its own PLMN.[¶](#section-2-1.38){.pilcrow}
:   

Serving Gateway:
:   The Serving Gateway (SGW) is a gateway function in the EPS, which
    terminates the interface towards the E-UTRAN. The SGW is the
    Mobility Anchor point for Layer 2 mobility (inter-eNodeB handovers).
    For each mobile terminal connected with the EPS, there is only one
    SGW at any given point in time. The SGW is essentially the
    user-plane part of the GPRS\'s SGSN.[¶](#section-2-1.40){.pilcrow}
:   

Serving GPRS Support Node:
:   The Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) is a network element located
    between the Radio Access Network (RAN) and the gateway (GGSN). A
    per-MT point-to-point (P2P) tunnel between the GGSN and SGSN
    transports the packets between the mobile terminal and the
    gateway.[¶](#section-2-1.42){.pilcrow}
:   

User Plane:
:   The user plane refers to data traffic and the required bearers for
    the data traffic. In practice, IP is the only data traffic protocol
    used in the user plane.[¶](#section-2-1.44){.pilcrow}

### [3.1.](#section-3.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Network Overview](#name-network-overview){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-network-overview}

4G mobile networks are designed to use IP transport for communication
among different elements such as the eNodeB, MME, SGW, PGW, HSS, Policy
and Charging Rule Function (PCRF), etc. \[[GRAYSON](#GRAYSON){.xref}\].
For backward compatibility with 3G, it has support for legacy circuit
switch features such as voice and SMS through transitional CS fallback
and flexible IP Multimedia Subsystems (IMS) deployment. For each mobile
device attached to the radio (eNodeB), there is a separate overlay
tunnel (GTP) between the eNodeB and Mobile Gateways (i.e.,
SGW/PGW).[¶](#section-3.1-1){.pilcrow}

When any mobile terminal is powered up, it attaches to a mobile network
based on its configuration and subscription. After a successful
attachment procedure, the mobile terminal registers with the mobile core
network using IPv4 and/or IPv6 addresses based on request and
capabilities offered by Mobile Gateways.[¶](#section-3.1-2){.pilcrow}

The GTP tunnel is used to carry user traffic between gateways and mobile
terminals, therefore using the unicast delivery for any data transfer.
It is also important to understand the overhead of GTP and IPsec
protocols. All mobile backhaul traffic is encapsulated using a GTP
tunnel, which has overhead of 8 bytes on top of IP and UDP
\[[NGMN](#NGMN){.xref}\]. Additionally, if IPsec is used for security
(which is often required if the Service Provider is using a shared
backhaul), it adds overhead based on the IPsec tunneling model (tunnel
or transport) as well as the encryption and authentication header
algorithm used. If we consider an Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
encryption as an example, the overhead can be significant
\[[OLTEANU](#OLTEANU){.xref}\], particularly for smaller
payloads.[¶](#section-3.1-3){.pilcrow}

If we consider the combined impact of GTP, IPsec, and unicast traffic,
the data delivery is not efficient because of overhead. The IETF has
developed various header compression algorithms to reduce the overhead
associated with IP packets. Some techniques are RObust Header
Compression (ROHC) and Enhanced Compression RTP (ECRTP) so that the
impact of overhead created by GTP, IPsec, etc., is reduced to some
extent \[[BROWER](#BROWER){.xref}\]. For commercial mobile networks,
3GPP has adopted different mechanisms for header compression to achieve
efficiency in data delivery \[[TS25.323](#TS25.323){.xref}\]; those
solutions can be adapted to other data protocols too such as ICN

During the mobile terminal attachment procedure, a default bearer is
created for each mobile terminal and it is assigned to the default
Access Point Name (APN), which provides the default transport. For any
QoS-aware application, one or more new dedicated bearers are established
between an eNodeB and a Mobile Gateway. A dedicated bearer can be
requested by either a mobile terminal or a Mobile Gateway based on the
direction of the first data flow. There are many bearers (logical paths)
established between an eNodeB and a Mobile Gateway for each mobile
terminal catering to a different data flow
simultaneously.[¶](#section-3.2-1){.pilcrow}

While all traffic within a certain bearer receives the same treatment,
QoS parameters supporting these requirements can be very granular in
different bearers. These values vary for the control, management, and
user traffic, and can be very different depending on application key
parameters such as latency, jitter (important for voice and other
real-time applications), packet loss, and queuing mechanism (strict
priority, low latency, fair, and so on).[¶](#section-3.2-2){.pilcrow}

Implementation of QoS for mobile networks is done at two stages: 1)
content prioritization/marking and transport marking and 2) congestion
management. From the transport perspective, QoS is defined at Layer 2 as
Class of Service (CoS) and at Layer 3 as Differentiated Services (DS).
The mapping of the Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) to CoS
takes place at Layer 2/3 switching and routing elements. 3GPP has a
specified QoS Class Identifier (QCI), which represents different types
of content and equivalent mappings to the DSCP at the transport layer
\[[TS23.401](#TS23.401){.xref}\]. However, this requires manual
configuration at different elements and is therefore prone to possible
misconfigurations.[¶](#section-3.2-3){.pilcrow}

In summary, QoS configuration in mobile networks for user-plane traffic
requires synchronization of parameters among different platforms.
Normally, QoS in IP is implemented using DiffServ, which uses hop-by-hop
QoS configuration at each router. Any inconsistency in IP QoS
configuration at routers in the forwarding path can result in a poor
subscriber experience (e.g., a packet classified as high priority can go
to a lower-priority queue). By deploying ICN, we intend to enhance the
subscriber experience using policy-based configuration, which can be
associated with the named contents \[[ICNQoS](#ICNQoS){.xref}\] at the
ICN forwarder. Further investigation is underway to understand how QoS
in ICN \[[QoS-ICN](#QoS-ICN){.xref}\] can be implemented with reference
to the ICN QoS guidelines \[[RFC9064](#RFC9064){.xref}\] to meet the QoS
requirements

The data delivered to mobile devices is sent in unicast semantic inside
the GTP tunnel from an eNodeB to a PDN gateway (PGW) as described in
3GPP specifications \[[TS23.401](#TS23.401){.xref}\]. While the
technology exists to address the issue of possible multicast delivery,
there are many difficulties related to multicast protocol
implementations on the RAN side of the network. By using eMBMS
\[[EMBMS](#EMBMS){.xref}\], multicast routing can be enabled in mobile
backhaul between an eNodeB and Mobile Gateways (SGW/PGW); however, for
radio interface it requires broadcast, which implies that we need a
dedicated radio channel. Implementation of eMBMS in RAN is still lagging
behind due to complexities related to client mobility, handovers, and
the fact that the potential gain to Service Providers may not justify
the investment, which explains the prevalence of unicast delivery in
mobile networks. Techniques to handle multicast (such as LTE-B or eMBMS)
have been designed to handle pre-planned content delivery, such as live
content, which contrasts user behavior today, largely based on a content
(or video) on-demand model.[¶](#section-3.3-1){.pilcrow}

To ease the burden on the bandwidth of the Service Gateway interface
(SGi), caching is introduced in a similar manner as with many
enterprises. In mobile networks, whenever possible, cached data is
delivered. Caching servers are placed at a centralized location,
typically in the Service Provider\'s Data Center, or in some cases
lightly distributed in packet core locations with the PGW nodes close to
the Internet and IP services access (SGi). This is a very inefficient
concept because traffic must traverse the entire backhaul path for the
data to be delivered to the end user. Other issues, such as out-of-order
delivery, contribute to this complexity and inefficiency, which needs to
be addressed at the application level.[¶](#section-3.3-2){.pilcrow}

The Mobile Gateways deployed in a major Service Provider network are
based on either dedicated hardware or commercial off-the-shelf (COTS)
x86 technology. With the adoption of Mobile Virtual Network Operators
(MVNOs), public safety networks, and enterprise mobility networks,
elastic mobile core architecture is needed. By deploying the mobile
packet core on a COTS platform, using a Network Function Virtualization
Infrastructure (NFVI) framework and end-to-end orchestration, new
deployments can be simplified to provide optimized total cost of
ownership (TCO).[¶](#section-3.4-1){.pilcrow}

While virtualization is growing, and many mobile providers use a hybrid
architecture that consists of dedicated and virtualized infrastructures,
the control and data planes are still the same. There is also work
underway to separate the control and user plane for the network to scale
better. Virtualized mobile networks and network slicing with control and
user-plane separation provide a mechanism to evolve the GTP-based
architecture towards an OpenFlow with signaling based on
Software-Defined Networking (SDN) for 4G and proposed 5G core. Some
early architecture work for 5G mobile technologies provides a mechanism
for control and user-plane separation and simplifies the mobility call
flow by introducing OpenFlow-based signaling \[[ICN5G](#ICN5G){.xref}\].

Edge computing transforms a Radio Access Network into an intelligent
service edge capable of delivering services directly from the edge of
the network while providing the best possible performance to the client.
Edge computing can be an ideal candidate for implementing ICN forwarders
in addition to its usual function of managing mobile termination. In
addition to edge computing, other transport elements, such as routers,
can work as ICN forwarders.[¶](#section-4-3){.pilcrow}

Data transport using ICN is different than IP-based transport as it
introduces uniquely named-data as a core design principle. Communication
in ICN takes place between the content provider (producer) and the end
user (consumer), as described in [Figure
2](#fig_icn_architecture){.xref}.[¶](#section-4-4){.pilcrow}

Every node in a physical path between a client and a content provider is
called the ICN forwarder or router. It can route the request
intelligently and cache content so it can be delivered locally for
subsequent requests from any other client. For mobile networks,
transport between a client and a content provider consists of a radio
network + mobile backhaul and IP core transport + Mobile Gateways +
Internet + Content Delivery Network (CDN).[¶](#section-4-5){.pilcrow}

To understand the suitability of ICN for mobile networks, we will
discuss the ICN framework by describing its protocol architecture and
different types of messages; this will be helpful when considering how
to use ICN in mobile networks to deliver content more efficiently. ICN
uses two types of packets called \"interest packet\" and \"data packet\"
as described in [Figure

Forwarder](#name-icn-interest-data-packet-an){.selfRef}
:::

In a 4G network, when a mobile device wants to receive certain content,
it will send an Interest message to the closest eNodeB. Interest packets
follow the TLV format \[[RFC8609](#RFC8609){.xref}\] and contain
mandatory fields such as the name of the content and content-matching
restrictions (KeyIdRestr and ContentObjectHashRestr) expressed as a
tuple \[[RFC8569](#RFC8569){.xref}\]. The content-matching tuple
uniquely identifies the matching data packet for the given Interest
packet. Another attribute called \"HopLimit\" is used to detect looping
Interest messages.[¶](#section-4-8){.pilcrow}

An ICN router will receive an Interest packet and lookup if a request
for such content has arrived earlier from another client. If so, it may
be served from the local cache; otherwise, the request is forwarded to
the next-hop ICN router. Each ICN router maintains three data
structures: Pending Interest Table (PIT), Forwarding Information Base
(FIB), and Content Store (CS). The Interest packet travels hop by hop
towards the content provider. Once the Interest packet reaches the
content provider, it will return a data packet containing information
such as content name, signature, and the actual
data.[¶](#section-4-9){.pilcrow}

The data packet travels in reverse direction following the same path
taken by the Interest packet, maintaining routing symmetry. Details
about algorithms used in PIT, FIB, CS, and security trust models are
described in various resources \[[CCN](#CCN){.xref}\]; here, we have
explained the concept and its applicability to the 4G

longer needs to traverse the entire backhaul path to reach the EPC. In
many cases, where feasible, the UPF can be collocated with the eNodeB,
which is also a business decision based on user demand. Placing a
Publisher close to the offload site, or at the offload site, provides
for a significant improvement in user experience, especially with

:::

As shown in [Figure 4](#fig_icn_ip_convergence_deployments){.xref}, for
applications (running either in the mobile terminal or in the content
provider system) to use the ICN transport option, we propose a new
transport convergence layer (TCL). The TCL helps determine the type of
transport (such as ICN or IP) as well as the type of radio interface
(LTE, Wi-Fi, or both) used to send and receive traffic based on
preference (e.g., content location, content type, content publisher,
congestion, cost, or QoS). It helps configure and determine the type of
connection (native IP or ICN) or the overlay mode (ICNoIP or IPoICN)
between application and the protocol stack (IP or
ICN).[¶](#section-5.2-3){.pilcrow}

Combined with the existing IP function, the ICN function provides
support for native ICN and/or the dual transport (ICN/IP) functionality.
See [Section 5.4.1](#dual_transport_icn_deploy_mt){.xref} for elaborate
descriptions of these functional layers.[¶](#section-5.2-4){.pilcrow}

The TCL can use several mechanisms for transport selection. It can use a
per-application configuration through a management interface, possibly a
user-facing setting realized through a user interface, like those used
to select cellular over Wi-Fi. In another option, it might use a
software API, which an adapted IP application could use to specify the
type of transport option (such as ICN) to take advantage of its
benefits.[¶](#section-5.2-5){.pilcrow}

Another potential application of TCL is in an implementation of network
slicing with a local slice management capability or through an interface
to an external slice manager via an API \[[GALIS](#GALIS){.xref}\]. This
solution can enable network slicing for IP and ICN transport selection
from the mobile terminal itself. The TCL could apply slice settings to
direct certain applications traffic over one slice and others over
another slice, determined by some form of a \'slicing policy\'. The
slicing policy can be obtained externally from the slice manager or
configured locally on the mobile terminal.[¶](#section-5.2-6){.pilcrow}

From the perspective of applications either on the mobile terminal or at
a content provider, the following options are possible for potential use
of ICN natively and/or with IP.[¶](#section-5.2-7){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

IP over IP (IPoIP):
:   In this scenario, the mobile terminal applications are tightly
    integrated with the existing IP transport infrastructure. The TCL

:   Similar to case 1, ICN applications tightly integrate with the ICN
    transport infrastructure. The TCL has no additional responsibility
    because packets are forwarded directly using the native ICN protocol
    stack, which sends packets over the ICN
    transport.[¶](#section-5.2-8.4){.pilcrow}
:   

ICN over IP (ICNoIP):

:   In this scenario, the underlying IP transport infrastructure is not
    impacted (that is, ICN is implemented as an IP overlay between
    mobile terminal and content provider). IP routing is used from the
    Radio Access Network (eNodeB) to the mobile backhaul, the IP core,
    and the Mobile Gateway (SGW/PGW). The mobile terminal attaches to
    the Mobile Gateway (SGW/PGW) using an IP address. Also, the data
    transport between Mobile Gateway (SGW/PGW) and content publisher
    uses IP. The content provider can serve content using either IP or
    ICN, based on the mobile terminal
    request.[¶](#section-5.2-8.6.1){.pilcrow}

    One of the approaches to implement ICN in mobile backhaul networks
    is described in \[[MBICN](#MBICN){.xref}\]. It implements a General
    Tunneling Protocol - User Plane (GTP-U) extension header option to
    encapsulate ICN payload in a GTP tunnel. However, as this design
    runs ICN as an IP overlay, the mobile backhaul can be deployed using
    native IP. The proposal describes a mechanism where the GTP-U tunnel
    can be terminated by hairpinning the packet before it reaches the
    SGW if an ICN-enabled node is deployed in the mobile backhaul (that
    is, between eNodeB and SGW). This could be useful when an ICN data
    packet is stored in the ICN node (such as repositories and caches)
    in the tunnel path so that the ICN node can reply without going all
    the way through the mobile core. While a GTP-U extension header is
    used to carry mobile-terminal-specific ICN payload, they are not
    visible to the transport, including the SGW. On the other hand, the
    PGW can use the mobile terminal-specific ICN header extension and
    ICN payload to set up an uplink transport towards a content provider
    in the Internet. In addition, the design assumes a proxy function at
    the edge to perform ICN data retrieval on behalf of a non-ICN end
    device.[¶](#section-5.2-8.6.2){.pilcrow}

:   

IP over ICN (IPoICN):

:   \[[IPoICN](#IPoICN){.xref}\] provides an architectural framework for
    running IP as an overlay over the ICN protocol. Implementing IP
    services over ICN provides an opportunity to leverage the benefits
    of ICN in the transport infrastructure while there is no impact on
    end devices (MT and access network) as they continue to use IP.
    IPoICN, however, will require an interworking function (IWF) (and
    Border Gateway) to translate various transport primitives. The IWF
    function will provide a mechanism for protocol translation between
    IPoICN and the native IP. After reviewing
    \[[IPoICN](#IPoICN){.xref}\], we understand and interpret that ICN
    is implemented in the transport natively; however, IP is implemented
    in MT, the eNodeB, and the Mobile Gateway (SGW/PGW), which is also
    called a network attach point
    (NAP).[¶](#section-5.2-8.8.1){.pilcrow}

    For this, said NAP receives an incoming IP or HTTP packet (the
    latter through TCP connection termination) and publishes the packet
    under a suitable ICN name (i.e., the hash over the destination IP
    address for an IP packet or the hash over the FQDN of the HTTP
    request for an HTTP packet) to the ICN network. In the HTTP case,
    the NAP maintains a pending request mapping table to map returning
    responses to the terminated TCP
    connection.[¶](#section-5.2-8.8.2){.pilcrow}

:   

Hybrid ICN (hICN):

:   An alternative approach to implement ICN over IP is provided in
    Hybrid ICN \[[HICN](#HICN){.xref}\]. It describes a novel approach
    to integrate ICN into IPv6 without creating overlays with a new
    packet format as an encapsulation. hICN addresses the content by
    encoding a location-independent name in an IPv6 address. It uses two
    name components, name prefix and name suffix, that identify the
    source of data and the data segment within the scope of the name
    prefix, respectively.[¶](#section-5.2-8.10.1){.pilcrow}

    At the application layer, hICN maps the name into an IPv6 prefix
    and, thus, uses IP as transport. As long as the name prefixes, which
    are routable IP prefixes, point towards a mobile GW (PGW or local
    breakout, such as CUPS), there are potentially no updates required
    to any of the mobile core gateways (for example, SGW/PGW). The IPv6
    backhaul routes the packets within the mobile core. hICN can run in
    the mobile terminal, the eNodeB, the mobile backhaul, or the mobile
    core. Finally, as hICN itself uses IPv6, it cannot be considered as
    an alternative transport layer.[¶](#section-5.2-8.10.2){.pilcrow}

In this section, we analyze signaling messages that are required for
different procedures, such as attach, handover, tracking area update,
and so on. The goal of this analysis is to see if there are any benefits
to replacing IP-based protocols with ICN for 4G signaling in the current
architecture. It is important to understand the concept of point of
attachment (POA). When a mobile terminal connects to a network, it has
the following POAs:[¶](#section-5.3-1){.pilcrow}

1.  [eNodeB managing location or physical
    POA[¶](#section-5.3-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.3-2.1}
2.  [Authentication and Authorization (MME, HSS) managing identity or
    authentication POA[¶](#section-5.3-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.3-2.2}
3.  [Mobile Gateways (SGW/PGW) managing logical or session management
    POA[¶](#section-5.3-2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.3-2.3}

In the current architecture, IP transport is used for all messages
associated with the control plane for mobility and session management.
IP is embedded very deeply into these messages utilizing TLV syntax for
carrying additional attributes such as a Layer 3 transport. The physical
POA in the eNodeB handles both mobility and session management for any
mobile terminal attached to a 4G network. The number of mobility
management messages between different nodes in a 4G network per the
signaling procedure is shown in [Table
1](#tab_4g_messages){.xref}.[¶](#section-5.3-3){.pilcrow}

Normally, two types of mobile terminals attach to the 4G network: SIM
based (which needs a 3GPP mobility protocol for authentication) or
non-SIM based (which connects to Wi-Fi networks). Both device types
require authentication. For non-SIM based devices, Authentication,
Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) is used for authentication. We do
not propose to change mobile terminal authentication or mobility
management messaging for user data transport using ICN. A separate study
would be required to analyze the impact of ICN on mobility management
messages, structures, and flows. We are merely analyzing the viability
of implementing ICN as a transport for control plane
messages.[¶](#section-5.3-4){.pilcrow}

It is important to note that if MME and HSS do not support ICN
transport, they still need to support a mobile terminal capable of dual
transport or native ICN. When a mobile terminal initiates an attach
request using the identity as ICN, MME must be able to parse that
message and create a session. MME forwards mobile terminal
authentication to HSS, so HSS must be able to authenticate an
ICN-capable mobile terminal and authorize Create Session

Anchorless mobility \[[ALM](#ALM){.xref}\] provides a fully
decentralized solution that is control plane agnostic to handle producer
mobility in ICN. Mobility management at the Layer 3 makes its access
agnostic and transparent to the end device or the application. The
solution discusses handling mobility without having to depend on core
network functions (e.g., MME); however, a location update to the core
network may still be required to support legal compliance requirements
such as lawful intercept and emergency services. These aspects are open
for further study.[¶](#section-5.3-7){.pilcrow}

One of the advantages of ICN is in the caching and reusing of the
content, which does not apply to the transactional signaling exchange.
After analyzing 4G signaling call flows \[[TS23.401](#TS23.401){.xref}\]
and message interdependencies (see [Table 1](#tab_4g_messages){.xref}),
our recommendation is that it is not beneficial to use ICN for control
plane and mobility management functions. Among the features of ICN
design, Interest aggregation and content caching are not applicable to
control plane signaling messages. Control plane messages are originated
and consumed by the applications, and they cannot be
shared.[¶](#section-5.3-8){.pilcrow}

The protocols and software stack used inside 4G-capable mobile terminals
support both 3G and 4G software interworking and handover. 3GPP Rel.13
specifications and onward describe the use of IP and non-IP protocols to
establish logical/session connectivity. We can leverage the non-IP
protocol-based mechanism to deploy an ICN protocol stack in the mobile
terminal as well as in an eNodeB and Mobile Gateways (SGW/PGW). The
following paragraphs describe per-layer considerations of supporting the
tunneling of ICN packets into IP or supporting ICN
natively.[¶](#section-5.4.1-5){.pilcrow}

1.  ::: {#section-5.4.1-6.1}
    An existing application layer can be modified to provide options for
    a new ICN-based application and existing IP-based applications. The
    mobile terminal can continue to support existing IP-based
    applications or can develop new applications to support native ICN,
    ICNoIP, or IPoICN-based transport. The application layer can be
    provided with an option of selecting either ICN or IP transport, as
    well as radio interface, to send and receive data
    traffic.[¶](#section-5.4.1-6.1.1){.pilcrow}

    Our proposal is to provide an Application Programming Interface
    (API) to the application developers so they can choose either ICN or
    IP transport for exchanging the traffic with the network. As
    mentioned in [Section 5.2](#icn_deployment_scenarios){.xref}, the
    TCL function handles the interaction of applications with multiple
    transport options.[¶](#section-5.4.1-6.1.2){.pilcrow}
    :::

2.  ::: {#section-5.4.1-6.2}
    The transport convergence layer helps determine the type of
    transport (such as ICN, hICN, or IP) and type of radio interface
    (LTE, Wi-Fi, or both) used to send and receive traffic. The
    application layer can make the decision to select a specific
    transport based on preference such as content location, content
    type, content publisher, congestion, cost, QoS, and so on. There can
    be an API to exchange parameters required for transport selection.
    Southbound interactions of the TCL will be either to IP or to ICN at
    the network layer.[¶](#section-5.4.1-6.2.1){.pilcrow}

    When selecting the IPoICN mode, the TCL is responsible for receiving
    an incoming IP or HTTP packet and publishing the packet to the ICN
    network under a suitable ICN name (that is, the hash over the
    destination IP address for an IP packet or the hash over the FQDN of
    the HTTP request for an HTTP
    packet).[¶](#section-5.4.1-6.2.2){.pilcrow}

    In the HTTP case, the TCL can maintain a pending request mapping
    table to map, returning responses to the originating HTTP request.
    The common API will provide a \"connection\" abstraction for this
    HTTP mode of operation, returning the response over said connection
    abstraction (akin to the TCP socket interface) while implementing a
    reliable transport connection semantic over the ICN from the mobile
    terminal to the receiving mobile terminal or the PGW. If the HTTP
    protocol stack remains unchanged, therefore utilizing the TCP
    protocol for transfer, the TCL operates in local TCP termination
    mode, retrieving the HTTP packet through said local
    termination.[¶](#section-5.4.1-6.2.3){.pilcrow}

changed communication model between the mobile terminal and eNodeB.
Also, we can avoid tunneling the user-plane traffic from an eNodeB to
the mobile packet core (SGW/PGW) through a GTP
tunnel.[¶](#section-5.4.2-4){.pilcrow}

For native ICN use, an application can be configured to use an ICN
forwarder, and it does not need the TCL layer. Also, to support ICN at
the network layer, the existing PDCP layer may need to be changed to be
aware of ICN capabilities and parameters.[¶](#section-5.4.2-5){.pilcrow}

The native implementation can provide new opportunities to develop new
use cases leveraging ICN capabilities such as seamless mobility, mobile
terminal to mobile terminal content delivery using a radio network
without traversing the Mobile Gateways, and
more.[¶](#section-5.4.2-6){.pilcrow}

transport/overlay and native ICN, respectively (see Figures

[7](#fig_native_icn_deployment_in_mt){.xref}). When a mobile terminal
performs an attach procedure, it will be assigned an identity as either
IP or dual transport (IP and ICN) or ICN endpoint. A mobile terminal can
initiate data traffic using any of the following

PDCP layer and sends the information on the air interface to the eNodeB,

Mobile Gateways (a.k.a. Evolved Packet Core (EPC)) include SGW and PGW,
which perform session management for MT from the initial attach to
disconnection. When MT is powered on, it performs Network-Access-Stratum
(NAS) signaling and attaches to PGW after successful authentication. PGW
is an anchoring point for MT and is responsible for service creations,
authorization, maintenance, and so on. The entire functionality is
managed using an IP address(es) for MT.[¶](#section-5.4.4-1){.pilcrow}

To implement ICN in EPC, the following functions are
proposed:[¶](#section-5.4.4-2){.pilcrow}

1.  [Insert ICN attributes in the session management layer for
    additional functionality with IP stack. The session management layer
    is used for performing attach procedures and assigning logical
    identity to users. After successful authentication by HSS, MME sends

    PGW.[¶](#section-5.4.4-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.4.4-3.1}

2.  [When MME sends a Create Session Request message (Step 12 in

    Protocol Configuration Option (PCO) Information Element (IE)
    containing MT capabilities. We can use PCO IE to carry ICN-related
    capabilities information from MT to PGW. This information is
    received from MT during the initial attach request in MME. Details
    of available TLV, which can be used for ICN, are given in subsequent
    sections. MT can support native IP, ICN+IP, or native ICN. IP is
    referred to as both IPv4 and IPv6
    protocols.[¶](#section-5.4.4-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.4.4-3.2}

3.  [For ICN+IP-capable MT, PGW assigns the MT both an IP address and
    ICN identity. MT selects either of the identities during the initial
    attach procedures and registers with the network for session
    management. For ICN-capable MT, it will provide only ICN attachment.
    For native IP-capable MT, there is no
    change.[¶](#section-5.4.4-3.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.4.4-3.3}

    PGW must communicate with an IP-enabled CDN provider, it will have
    to use an ICN-IP interworking gateway to perform conversion between
    ICN and IP primitives for data retrieval. In the case of CUPS
    implementation with an offload close to the edge, this interworking
    gateway can be collocated with the UPF at the offload site to

4.  [CDN: Content delivery by a Publisher

For the purpose of this testing, ICN-emulating code can be inserted in
the test code in EMU to emulate an ICN-capable eNodeB. An example of the
code to be used is NS3 in its LTE model. The effect of such traffic on
EPC and CDN can be observed and documented. In a subsequent phase, EPC
code supporting ICN can be tested when
available.[¶](#section-5.5-5){.pilcrow}

Another option is to simulate the UE/eNodeB and EPC functions using
NS3\'s LTE \[[NS3LTE](#NS3LTE){.xref}\] and EPC
\[[NS3EPC](#NS3EPC){.xref}\] models, respectively. The LTE model
includes the LTE Radio Protocol stack, which resides entirely within the
UE and the eNodeB nodes. This capability provides the simulation of UE
and eNodeB deployment use cases. Similarly, the EPC model includes core
network interfaces, protocols, and entities, which reside within the
Mobile Gateways (SGW/PGW), and MME nodes and partially within the eNodeB
nodes.[¶](#section-5.5-6){.pilcrow}

Even with its current limitations (such as IPv4 only, lack of
integration with ndnSIM, and no support for UE idle state), LTE
simulation may be a very useful tool. In any case, both control and

    protocols will be achieved. The multiple overlays (e.g., the MPLS,

### [8.1.](#section-8.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Security Considerations](#name-security-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-security-considerations}

To ensure only authenticated mobile terminals are connected to the
network, 4G mobile networks implement various security mechanisms. From
the perspective of using ICN in the user plane, the following security
aspects need to be taken care of:[¶](#section-8.1-1){.pilcrow}

1.  [MT authentication and
    authorization[¶](#section-8.1-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-8.1-2.1}
2.  [Radio or air interface
    security[¶](#section-8.1-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-8.1-2.2}
3.  [Denial-of-service attacks on the Mobile Gateway; services are
    either by the MT or by external entities in the
    Internet[¶](#section-8.1-2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-8.1-2.3}
4.  [Content poisoning in either transport or
    servers[¶](#section-8.1-2.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-8.1-2.4}
5.  [Content cache pollution
    attacks[¶](#section-8.1-2.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-8.1-2.5}
6.  [Secure naming, routing, and
    forwarding[¶](#section-8.1-2.6){.pilcrow}]{#section-8.1-2.6}
7.  [Application
    security[¶](#section-8.1-2.7){.pilcrow}]{#section-8.1-2.7}

Security over the LTE air interface is provided through cryptographic
techniques. When MT is powered up, it performs a key exchange between
the MT\'s Universal Mobile Telecommunications System Subscriber Identity
Module (USIM) and HSS/Authentication Center using NAS messages,
including ciphering and integrity protections between MT and MME.
Details for secure MT authentication, key exchange, ciphering, and
integrity protection messages are given in the 3GPP call flow
\[[TS23.401](#TS23.401){.xref}\]. With ICN, we are modifying the
protocol stack for the user plane and not the control plane. The NAS
signaling is exchanged between MT and Mobile Gateways, e.g., MME, using
the control plane; therefore, there is no adverse impact of ICN on
MT.[¶](#section-8.1-3){.pilcrow}

4G uses IP transport in its mobile backhaul (between an eNodeB and the
core network). In case of provider-owned backhaul, the Service Provider
may require implementing a security mechanism in the backhaul network.
The native IP transport continues to leverage security mechanisms such
as Internet Key Exchange (IKE) and the IP Security (IPsec) protocol.
More details of mobile backhaul security are provided in 3GPP network
security specifications \[[TS33.310](#TS33.310){.xref}\] and
\[[TS33.320](#TS33.320){.xref}\]. When a mobile backhaul is upgraded to
support dual transport (IP+ICN) or native ICN, it is required to
implement security techniques that are deployed in the mobile backhaul.
When ICN forwarding is enabled on mobile transport routers, we need to
deploy security practices based on \[[RFC7476](#RFC7476){.xref}\] and
\[[RFC7927](#RFC7927){.xref}\].[¶](#section-8.1-4){.pilcrow}

4G Mobile Gateways (SGW/PGW) perform some key functions such as
content-based online/offline billing and accounting, deep packet
inspection (DPI), and lawful interception (LI). When ICN is deployed in
the user plane, we need to integrate ICN security for sessions between
MT and the gateway. If we encrypt user-plane payload metadata, then it
might be difficult to perform routing based on contents and it may not
work because we need decryption keys at every forwarder to route the
content. The content itself can be encrypted between publisher and
consumer to ensure privacy. Only the user with the right decryption key
shall be able to access the content. We need further research for ICN
impact on LI, online/offline charging, and
accounting.[¶](#section-8.1-5){.pilcrow}

### [8.2.](#section-8.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Privacy Considerations](#name-privacy-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-privacy-considerations}

In 4G networks, there are two main privacy issues
\[[MUTHANA](#MUTHANA){.xref}\]:[¶](#section-8.2-1){.pilcrow}

1.  [User Identity Privacy Issues. The main privacy issue within 4G is
    the exposure of the International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI).
    The IMSI can be intercepted by adversaries. Such attacks are
    commonly referred to as \"IMSI
    catching\".[¶](#section-8.2-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-8.2-2.1}
2.  [Location Privacy Issues. IMSI catching is closely related to the
    issue of location privacy. Knowing the IMSI of a user allows the
    attacker to track the user\'s movements and create a profile about
    the user and thus breach the user\'s location
    privacy.[¶](#section-8.2-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-8.2-2.2}

In any network, caching implies a trade-off between network efficiency
and privacy. The activity of users is exposed to the scrutiny of cache
owners with whom they may not have any relationship. By monitoring the
cache transactions, an attacker could obtain significant information
related to the objects accessed, topology, and timing of the requests
\[[RFC7945](#RFC7945){.xref}\]. Privacy concerns are amplified by the
introduction of new network functions such as information lookup and
network storage, and different forms of communication
\[[FOTIOU](#FOTIOU){.xref}\]. Privacy risks in ICN can be broadly
divided in the following categories
\[[TOURANI](#TOURANI){.xref}\]:[¶](#section-8.2-3){.pilcrow}

1.  [Timing attack[¶](#section-8.2-4.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-8.2-4.1}
2.  [Communication monitoring
    attack[¶](#section-8.2-4.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-8.2-4.2}
3.  [Censorship and anonymity
    attack[¶](#section-8.2-4.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-8.2-4.3}
4.  [Protocol attack[¶](#section-8.2-4.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-8.2-4.4}
5.  [Naming-signature
    privacy[¶](#section-8.2-4.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-8.2-4.5}

The introduction of TCL effectively enables ICN at the application
and/or transport layer depending on the scenario described in [Section
5](#icn_deploy_4g_networks){.xref}. Enabling ICN in 4G networks is
expected to increase efficiency by taking advantage of ICN\'s inherent
characteristics. This approach would potentially leave some of the
above-mentioned privacy concerns open as a consequence of using ICN
transport and ICN inherent privacy
vulnerabilities.[¶](#section-8.2-5){.pilcrow}

1.  [IPoIP ([Section 5.2](#icn_deployment_scenarios){.xref}) would not
    be affected as TCL has no role in it, and ICN does not
    apply.[¶](#section-8.2-6.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-8.2-6.1}
2.  [The ICNoICN scenario ([Section
    5.2](#icn_deployment_scenarios){.xref}) has increased risk of a
    privacy attack, and that risk is applicable to the ICN protocol in
    general rather than specifically to the 4G implementation. Since
    this scenario describes communication over ICN transport, every
    forwarder in the path could be a potential risk for a privacy
    attack.[¶](#section-8.2-6.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-8.2-6.2}
3.  [The ICNoIP scenario ([Section
    5.2](#icn_deployment_scenarios){.xref}) uses IP for transport, so
    the only additional ICN-related potential privacy risk areas are the
    endpoints (consumer and publisher) where, at the application layer,
    content is being
    served.[¶](#section-8.2-6.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-8.2-6.3}
4.  [The IPoICN scenario ([Section
    5.2](#icn_deployment_scenarios){.xref}) could have potentially
    increased risk due to possible vulnerability of the forwarders in
    the path of ICN
    transport.[¶](#section-8.2-6.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-8.2-6.4}

Privacy issues already identified in 4G remain a concern if ICN is
introduced in any of the scenarios described earlier and compounds to
the new ICN-related privacy issues. Many research papers have been
published that propose solutions to the privacy issues listed above. For
LTE-specific privacy issues, some of the proposed solutions
\[[MUTHANA](#MUTHANA){.xref}\] are IMSI encryption by an MT; mutual
authentication; concealing the real IMSI within a random bit stream of
certain size where only the subscriber and HSS could extract the
respective IMSI; IMSI replacement with a changing pseudonym that only
the HSS server can map to the UE\'s IMSI; and others. Similarly, some of
the proposed ICN-specific privacy concerns mitigation methods,
applicable where ICN transport is introduced as specified earlier in
this section, include the following
\[[FOTIOU](#FOTIOU){.xref}\]:[¶](#section-8.2-7){.pilcrow}

-   [Delay for the first, or first k, interests on edge routers (timing
    attack)[¶](#section-8.2-8.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-8.2-8.1}
-   [Creating a secure tunnel or clients flagging the requests as
    non-cacheable for privacy (communication monitoring
    attack)[¶](#section-8.2-8.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-8.2-8.2}
-   [Encoding interest by mixing the content and cover file or using a
    hierarchical DNS-based brokering model (censorship and anonymity
    attack)[¶](#section-8.2-8.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-8.2-8.3}
-   [Use of rate-limiting requests for a specific namespace (protocol
    attack)[¶](#section-8.2-8.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-8.2-8.4}
-   [Cryptographic content hash-based naming or digital identity in an
    overlay network (naming-signature
    privacy)[¶](#section-8.2-8.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-8.2-8.5}

Further research in this area is needed. Detailed discussion of privacy
is beyond the scope of this document.[¶](#section-8.2-9){.pilcrow}

In this document, we have discussed 4G networks and the experimental
setups to study the advantages of the potential use of ICN for efficient
delivery of contents to mobile terminals. We have discussed different
options to try and test ICN and dependencies such as ICN functionalities
and changes required in different 4G network elements. In order to
further explore potential use of ICN, one can devise an experimental
setup consisting of 4G network elements and deploy ICN data transport in
the user plane. Different options can be overlay, dual transport (IP +
ICN), hICN, or natively (by integrating ICN with CDN, eNodeB, SGW, PGW,
and a transport network). Note that, for the scenarios discussed above,
additional study is required for lawful interception, billing/mediation,
network slicing, and provisioning APIs.[¶](#section-9-1){.pilcrow}

Edge Computing \[[CHENG](#CHENG){.xref}\] provides capabilities to
deploy functionalities such as CDN caching and mobile user plane
functions (UPFs) \[[TS23.501](#TS23.501){.xref}\]. Recent research for
delivering real-time video content \[[MPVCICN](#MPVCICN){.xref}\] using
ICN has also been proven to be efficient \[[NDNRTC](#NDNRTC){.xref}\]
and can be used towards realizing the benefits of using ICN in an
eNodeB, edge computing, Mobile Gateways (SGW/PGW), and CDN. The key
aspect for ICN is in its seamless integration in 4G and 5G networks with
tangible benefits so we can optimize content delivery using a simple and
scalable architecture. The authors will continue to explore how ICN
forwarding in edge computing could be used for efficient data delivery
from the mobile edge.[¶](#section-9-2){.pilcrow}

Based on our study of control plane signaling, it is not beneficial to
deploy ICN with existing protocols unless further changes are introduced
in the control protocol stack itself.[¶](#section-9-3){.pilcrow}

As a starting step towards use of ICN in the user plane, it is proposed
to incorporate protocol changes in MT, an eNodeB, and SGW/PGW for data
transport. ICN has inherent capabilities for mobility and content
caching, which can improve the efficiency of data transport for unicast
and multicast delivery. The authors welcome contributions and
suggestions, including those related to further validations of the
principles by implementing prototypes and/or proof of concepts in the
lab and in the production environment.[¶](#section-9-4){.pilcrow}
