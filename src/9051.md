# RFC 9051 {#rfcnum}

# Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) - Version 4rev2 {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

The Internet Message Access Protocol Version 4rev2 (IMAP4rev2) allows a
client to access and manipulate electronic mail messages on a server.
IMAP4rev2 permits manipulation of mailboxes (remote message folders) in
a way that is functionally equivalent to local folders. IMAP4rev2 also
provides the capability for an offline client to resynchronize with the
server.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

IMAP4rev2 includes operations for creating, deleting, and renaming
mailboxes; checking for new messages; removing messages permanently;
setting and clearing flags; parsing per RFCs 5322, 2045, and 2231;
searching; and selective fetching of message attributes, texts, and
portions thereof. Messages in IMAP4rev2 are accessed by the use of
numbers. These numbers are either message sequence numbers or unique
identifiers.[¶](#section-abstract-2){.pilcrow}

IMAP4rev2 does not specify a means of posting mail; this function is
handled by a mail submission protocol such as the one specified in RFC
6409.[¶](#section-abstract-3){.pilcrow}

### [1.1.](#section-1.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Organization of This Document](#name-organization-of-this-docume){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-organization-of-this-docume}

This document is written from the point of view of the implementor of an
IMAP4rev2 client or server. Beyond the protocol overview in [Section
2](#protocol_overview){.xref}, it is not optimized for someone trying to
understand the operation of the protocol. The material in Sections
[3](#state_and_flow){.xref}, [4](#data_formats){.xref}, and
[5](#operational_considerations){.xref} provides the general context and
definitions with which IMAP4rev2 operates.[¶](#section-1.1-1){.pilcrow}

Sections [6](#client_commands){.xref}, [7](#server-responses){.xref},
and [9](#IMAP-ABNF){.xref} describe the IMAP commands, responses, and
syntax, respectively. The relationships among these are such that it is
almost impossible to understand any of them separately. In particular,
do not attempt to deduce command syntax from the command section alone;
instead, refer to \"Formal Syntax\" ([Section
9](#IMAP-ABNF){.xref}).[¶](#section-1.1-2){.pilcrow}

\"Conventions\" are basic principles or procedures. Document conventions
are noted in this section.[¶](#section-1.2-1){.pilcrow}

In examples, \"C:\" and \"S:\" indicate lines sent by the client and
server, respectively. Note that each line includes the terminating
CRLF.[¶](#section-1.2-2){.pilcrow}

The key words \"[MUST]{.bcp14}\", \"[MUST NOT]{.bcp14}\",
\"[REQUIRED]{.bcp14}\", \"[SHALL]{.bcp14}\", \"[SHALL NOT]{.bcp14}\",

\[[RFC8174](#RFC8174){.xref}\] when, and only when, they appear in all
capitals, as shown here.[¶](#section-1.2-3){.pilcrow}

The word \"can\" (not \"may\") is used to refer to a possible
circumstance or situation, as opposed to an optional facility of the
protocol.[¶](#section-1.2-4){.pilcrow}

\"User\" is used to refer to a human user, whereas \"client\" refers to
the software being run by the user.[¶](#section-1.2-5){.pilcrow}

\"Connection\" refers to the entire sequence of client/server
interaction from the initial establishment of the network connection
until its termination.[¶](#section-1.2-6){.pilcrow}

\"Session\" refers to the sequence of client/server interaction from the
time that a mailbox is selected (SELECT or EXAMINE command) until the
time that selection ends (SELECT or EXAMINE of another mailbox, CLOSE
command, UNSELECT command, or connection
termination).[¶](#section-1.2-7){.pilcrow}

The term \"Implicit TLS\" refers to the automatic negotiation of TLS
whenever a TCP connection is made on a particular TCP port that is used
exclusively by that server for TLS connections. The term \"Implicit
TLS\" is intended to contrast with the use of the STARTTLS command in
IMAP that is used by the client and the server to explicitly negotiate
TLS on an established cleartext TCP
connection.[¶](#section-1.2-8){.pilcrow}

Characters are 8-bit UTF-8 (of which 7-bit US-ASCII is a subset), unless
otherwise specified. Other character sets are indicated using a
\"CHARSET\", as described in \[[MIME-IMT](#RFC2046){.xref}\] and defined
in \[[CHARSET](#RFC2978){.xref}\]. CHARSETs have important additional
semantics in addition to defining a character set; refer to these
documents for more detail.[¶](#section-1.2-9){.pilcrow}

There are several protocol conventions in IMAP. These refer to aspects
of the specification that are not strictly part of the IMAP protocol but
reflect generally accepted practice. Implementations need to be aware of
these conventions, and avoid conflicts whether or not they implement the
convention. For example, \"&\" may not be used as a hierarchy delimiter
since it conflicts with the Mailbox International Naming Convention, and
other uses of \"&\" in mailbox names are impacted as
well.[¶](#section-1.2-10){.pilcrow}

### [1.3.](#section-1.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Special Notes to Implementors](#name-special-notes-to-implemento){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-special-notes-to-implemento}

Implementors of the IMAP protocol are strongly encouraged to read the
IMAP implementation recommendations document
\[[IMAP-IMPLEMENTATION](#RFC2683){.xref}\] in conjunction with this
document, to help understand the intricacies of this protocol and how
best to build an interoperable product.[¶](#section-1.3-1){.pilcrow}

IMAP4rev2 is designed to be upwards compatible from the IMAP4rev1
\[[RFC3501](#RFC3501){.xref}\], IMAP2 \[[IMAP2](#RFC1176){.xref}\], and
unpublished IMAP2bis \[[IMAP2BIS](#I-D.ietf-imap-imap2bis){.xref}\]
protocols. IMAP4rev2 is largely compatible with the IMAP4rev1 protocol
described in RFC 3501 and the IMAP4 protocol described in
\[[RFC1730](#RFC1730){.xref}\]; the exception being in certain
facilities added in \[[RFC1730](#RFC1730){.xref}\] and
\[[RFC3501](#RFC3501){.xref}\] that proved problematic and were
subsequently removed or replaced by better alternatives. In the course
of the evolution of IMAP4rev2, some aspects in the earlier protocols
have become obsolete. Obsolete commands, responses, and data formats
that an IMAP4rev2 implementation can encounter when used with an earlier
implementation are described in Appendices [A](#IMAP4rev1-compat){.xref}
and [E](#changesFromIMAP4rev1){.xref} and
\[[IMAP-OBSOLETE](#RFC2062){.xref}\]. IMAP4rev2 supports 63-bit body
parts and message sizes. IMAP4rev2 compatibility with BINARY and
LIST-EXTENDED IMAP extensions are described in Appendices
[B](#BINARY-compat){.xref} and [C](#LIST-EXTENDED-compat){.xref},
respectively.[¶](#section-1.3-2){.pilcrow}

Other compatibility issues with IMAP2bis, the most common variant of the
earlier protocol, are discussed in \[[IMAP-COMPAT](#RFC2061){.xref}\]. A
full discussion of compatibility issues with rare (and presumed extinct)
variants of \[[IMAP2](#RFC1176){.xref}\] is in
\[[IMAP-HISTORICAL](#RFC1732){.xref}\]; this document is primarily of
historical interest.[¶](#section-1.3-3){.pilcrow}

IMAP was originally developed for the older
\[[RFC822](#RFC0822){.xref}\] standard, and as a consequence, the
\"RFC822.SIZE\" fetch item in IMAP incorporates \"RFC822\" in its name.
\"RFC822\" should be interpreted as a reference to the updated
\[[RFC5322](#RFC5322){.xref}\] standard.[¶](#section-1.3-4){.pilcrow}

IMAP4rev2 does not specify a means of posting mail; this function is
handled by a mail submission protocol such as the one specified in
\[[RFC6409](#RFC6409){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1.3-5){.pilcrow}

### [2.1.](#section-2.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Link Level](#name-link-level){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-link-level}

The IMAP4rev2 protocol assumes a reliable data stream such as that
provided by TCP. When TCP is used, an IMAP4rev2 server listens on port
143 (cleartext port) or port 993 (Implicit TLS
port).[¶](#section-2.1-1){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-2.2 .section}
### [2.2.](#section-2.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Commands and Responses](#name-commands-and-responses){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-commands-and-responses}

An IMAP4rev2 connection consists of the establishment of a client/server
network connection, an initial greeting from the server, and
client/server interactions. These client/server interactions consist of
a client command, server data, and a server completion result
response.[¶](#section-2.2-1){.pilcrow}

All interactions transmitted by client and server are in the form of
lines, that is, strings that end with a CRLF. The protocol receiver of
an IMAP4rev2 client or server is reading either a line or a sequence of
octets with a known count followed by a
line.[¶](#section-2.2-2){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-2.2.1 .section}
#### [2.2.1.](#section-2.2.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Client Protocol Sender and Server Protocol Receiver](#name-client-protocol-sender-and-){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-client-protocol-sender-and-}

The client command begins an operation. Each client command is prefixed
with an identifier (typically a short alphanumeric string, e.g., A0001,
A0002, etc.) called a \"tag\". A different tag is generated by the
client for each command. More formally: the client [SHOULD]{.bcp14}
generate a unique tag for every command, but a server [MUST]{.bcp14}
accept tag reuse.[¶](#section-2.2.1-1){.pilcrow}

Clients [MUST]{.bcp14} follow the syntax outlined in this specification
strictly. It is a syntax error to send a command with missing or
extraneous spaces or arguments.[¶](#section-2.2.1-2){.pilcrow}

There are two cases in which a line from the client does not represent a
complete command. In one case, a command argument is quoted with an
octet count (see the description of literal in [Section
4.3](#data-string){.xref}); in the other case, the command arguments
require server feedback (see the AUTHENTICATE command in [Section
6.2.2](#authenticate){.xref}). In either case, the server sends a
command continuation request response if it is ready for the octets (if
appropriate) and the remainder of the command. This response is prefixed
with the token \"+\".[¶](#section-2.2.1-3){.pilcrow}

Note: If, instead, the server detected an error in the command, it sends
a BAD completion response with a tag matching the command (as described
below) to reject the command and prevent the client from sending any
more of the command.[¶](#section-2.2.1-4){.pilcrow}

It is also possible for the server to send a completion response for
some other command (if multiple commands are in progress) or untagged
data. In either case, the command continuation request is still pending;
the client takes the appropriate action for the response and reads
another response from the server. In all cases, the client
[MUST]{.bcp14} send a complete command (including receiving all command
continuation request responses and sending command continuations for the
command) before initiating a new command.[¶](#section-2.2.1-5){.pilcrow}

The protocol receiver of an IMAP4rev2 server reads a command line from
the client, parses the command and its arguments, and transmits server
data and a server command completion result
response.[¶](#section-2.2.1-6){.pilcrow}

Data transmitted by the server to the client and status responses that
do not indicate command completion are prefixed with the token \"\*\"
and are called untagged responses.[¶](#section-2.2.2-1){.pilcrow}

Server data [MAY]{.bcp14} be sent as a result of a client command or
[MAY]{.bcp14} be sent unilaterally by the server. There is no syntactic
difference between server data that resulted from a specific command and
server data that were sent unilaterally.[¶](#section-2.2.2-2){.pilcrow}

The server completion result response indicates the success or failure
of the operation. It is tagged with the same tag as the client command
that began the operation. Thus, if more than one command is in progress,
the tag in a server completion response identifies the command to which
the response applies. There are three possible server completion
responses: OK (indicating success), NO (indicating failure), or BAD
(indicating a protocol error such as unrecognized command or command
syntax error).[¶](#section-2.2.2-3){.pilcrow}

Servers [SHOULD]{.bcp14} strictly enforce the syntax outlined in this
specification. Any client command with a protocol syntax error,
including (but not limited to) missing or extraneous spaces or
arguments, [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be rejected and the client given a BAD
server completion response.[¶](#section-2.2.2-4){.pilcrow}

The protocol receiver of an IMAP4rev2 client reads a response line from
the server. It then takes action on the response based upon the first
token of the response, which can be a tag, a \"\*\", or a
\"+\".[¶](#section-2.2.2-5){.pilcrow}

A client [MUST]{.bcp14} be prepared to accept any server response at all
times. This includes server data that was not requested. Server data
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} be remembered (cached), so that the client can
reference its remembered copy rather than sending a command to the
server to request the data. In the case of certain server data, the data
[MUST]{.bcp14} be remembered, as specified elsewhere in this
document.[¶](#section-2.2.2-6){.pilcrow}

### [2.3.](#section-2.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Message Attributes](#name-message-attributes){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-message-attributes}

In addition to message text, each message has several attributes
associated with it. These attributes can be retrieved individually or in

#### [2.3.1.](#section-2.3.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Message Numbers](#name-message-numbers){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-message-numbers}

Messages in IMAP4rev2 are accessed by one of two numbers: the Unique
Identifier (UID) or the message sequence
number.[¶](#section-2.3.1-1){.pilcrow}

::: {#uid-def}
::: {#section-2.3.1.1 .section}
##### [2.3.1.1.](#section-2.3.1.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Unique Identifier (UID) Message Attribute](#name-unique-identifier-uid-messa){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-unique-identifier-uid-messa}

[]{#iref-unique-identifier-uid-messa .iref}

A UID is an unsigned non-zero 32-bit value assigned to each message,
which when used with the unique identifier validity value (see below)
forms a 64-bit value that [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} refer to any other message
in the mailbox or any subsequent mailbox with the same name forever.
Unique identifiers are assigned in a strictly ascending fashion in the
mailbox; as each message is added to the mailbox, it is assigned a
higher UID than those of all message(s) that are already in the mailbox.
Unlike message sequence numbers, unique identifiers are not necessarily
contiguous.[¶](#section-2.3.1.1-1){.pilcrow}

The unique identifier of a message [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} change during the
session and [SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} change between sessions. Any change of
unique identifiers between sessions [MUST]{.bcp14} be detectable using
the UIDVALIDITY mechanism discussed below. Persistent unique identifiers
are required for a client to resynchronize its state from a previous
session with the server (e.g., disconnected or offline access clients
\[[IMAP-MODEL](#RFC1733){.xref}\]); this is discussed further in
\[[IMAP-DISC](#RFC4549){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2.3.1.1-2){.pilcrow}

Associated with every mailbox are two 32-bit unsigned non-zero values
that aid in unique identifier handling: the next unique identifier value
(UIDNEXT) and the unique identifier validity value
(UIDVALIDITY).[¶](#section-2.3.1.1-3){.pilcrow}

The next unique identifier value is the predicted value that will be
assigned to a new message in the mailbox. Unless the unique identifier
validity also changes (see below), the next unique identifier value
[MUST]{.bcp14} have the following two characteristics. First, the next
unique identifier value [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} change unless new messages
are added to the mailbox; and second, the next unique identifier value
[MUST]{.bcp14} change whenever new messages are added to the mailbox,
even if those new messages are subsequently
expunged.[¶](#section-2.3.1.1-4){.pilcrow}

Note: The next unique identifier value is intended to provide a means
for a client to determine whether any messages have been delivered to
the mailbox since the previous time it checked this value. It is not
intended to provide any guarantee that any message will have this unique
identifier. A client can only assume, at the time that it obtains the
next unique identifier value, that messages arriving after that time
will have a UID greater than or equal to that
value.[¶](#section-2.3.1.1-5.1){.pilcrow}

The unique identifier validity value is sent in a UIDVALIDITY response
code in an OK untagged response at mailbox selection time. If unique
identifiers from an earlier session fail to persist in this session, the
unique identifier validity value [MUST]{.bcp14} be greater than the one
used in the earlier session. A good UIDVALIDITY value to use is a 32-bit
representation of the current date/time when the value is assigned: this
ensures that the value is unique and always increases. Another possible
alternative is a global counter that gets incremented every time a
mailbox is created.[¶](#section-2.3.1.1-6){.pilcrow}

Note: Ideally, unique identifiers [SHOULD]{.bcp14} persist at all times.
Although this specification recognizes that failure to persist can be
unavoidable in certain server environments, it strongly encourages
message store implementation techniques that avoid this problem. For
example:[¶](#section-2.3.1.1-7){.pilcrow}

1.  [Unique identifiers [MUST]{.bcp14} be strictly ascending in the
    mailbox at all times. If the physical message store is reordered by
    a non-IMAP agent, the unique identifiers in the mailbox
    [MUST]{.bcp14} be regenerated, since the former unique identifiers
    are no longer strictly ascending as a result of the
    reordering.[¶](#section-2.3.1.1-8.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.3.1.1-8.1}
2.  [If the message store has no mechanism to store unique identifiers,
    it must regenerate unique identifiers at each session, and each
    session must have a unique UIDVALIDITY value. Note that this
    situation can be very disruptive to client message
    caching.[¶](#section-2.3.1.1-8.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.3.1.1-8.2}
3.  [If the mailbox is deleted/renamed and a new mailbox with the same
    name is created at a later date, the server must either keep track
    of unique identifiers from the previous instance of the mailbox or
    assign a new UIDVALIDITY value to the new instance of the
    mailbox.[¶](#section-2.3.1.1-8.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.3.1.1-8.3}
4.  [The combination of mailbox name, UIDVALIDITY, and UID must refer to
    a single, immutable (or expunged) message on that server forever. In
    particular, the internal date, RFC822.SIZE, envelope, body
    structure, and message texts (all BODY\[\...\] fetch data items)
    [MUST]{.bcp14} never change. This does not include message numbers,
    nor does it include attributes that can be set by a STORE command
    (such as FLAGS). When a message is expunged, its UID [MUST
    NOT]{.bcp14} be reused under the same UIDVALIDITY
    value.[¶](#section-2.3.1.1-8.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.3.1.1-8.4}

[]{#iref-message-sequence-number-mes .iref}

A message sequence number is a relative position from 1 to the number of
messages in the mailbox. This position [MUST]{.bcp14} be ordered by
ascending unique identifiers. As each new message is added, it is
assigned a message sequence number that is 1 higher than the number of
messages in the mailbox before that new message was
added.[¶](#section-2.3.1.2-1){.pilcrow}

Message sequence numbers can be reassigned during the session. For
example, when a message is permanently removed (expunged) from the
mailbox, the message sequence number for all subsequent messages is
decremented. The number of messages in the mailbox is also decremented.
Similarly, a new message can be assigned a message sequence number that
was once held by some other message prior to an
expunge.[¶](#section-2.3.1.2-2){.pilcrow}

In addition to accessing messages by relative position in the mailbox,
message sequence numbers can be used in mathematical calculations. For
example, if an untagged \"11 EXISTS\" is received, and previously an
untagged \"8 EXISTS\" was received, three new messages have arrived with
message sequence numbers of 9, 10, and 11. As another example, if
message 287 in a 523-message mailbox has UID 12345, there are exactly
286 messages that have lesser UIDs and 236 messages that have greater
UIDs.[¶](#section-2.3.1.2-3){.pilcrow}

A message has a list of zero or more named tokens, known as \"flags\",

    something of the form, \"This message may be trying to steal your
    personal information,\" when the user clicks on any hyperlinks
    within the message.[¶](#section-2.3.2-6.10.2){.pilcrow}

    The requirement for both \$Phishing and \$Junk to be set before a
    user agent displays a warning is for better backwards compatibility
    with existing clients that understand the \$Junk flag but not the
    \$Phishing flag. This is so that when an unextended client removes
    the \$Junk flag, an extended client will also show the correct
    state. See \[[IMAP-KEYWORDS-REG](#IMAP-KEYWORDS-REG){.xref}\] for
    more information.[¶](#section-2.3.2-6.10.3){.pilcrow}

set, and it [SHOULD]{.bcp14} unset both of them on the IMAP
server.[¶](#section-2.3.2-7){.pilcrow}

Other registered keywords can be found in the \"IMAP and JMAP Keywords\"
registry \[[IMAP-KEYWORDS-REG](#IMAP-KEYWORDS-REG){.xref}\]. New

[]{#iref-permanent-flag-class-of-fla .iref}
[]{#iref-session-flag-class-of-flag- .iref} A flag can be permanent or

An Internal Date message attribute is the internal date and time of the

IMAP4rev2 uses textual commands and responses. Data in IMAP4rev2 can be
in one of several forms: atom, number, string, parenthesized list, or
NIL. Note that a particular data item may take more than one form; for
example, a data item defined as using \"astring\" syntax may be either
an atom or a string.[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

A set of messages can be referenced by a sequence set containing either
message sequence numbers or unique identifiers. See [Section
9](#IMAP-ABNF){.xref} for details. A sequence set can contain ranges of
sequence numbers (such as \"5:50\"), an enumeration of specific sequence

special symbol \"\*\" to represent the maximum sequence number in the
mailbox. A sequence set never contains unique

### [4.3.](#section-4.3){.section-number .selfRef} [String](#name-string){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-string}

A string is in one of three forms: synchronizing literal,
non-synchronizing literal, or quoted string. The synchronizing literal
form is the general form of a string, without limitation on the
characters the string may include. The non-synchronizing literal form is
also the general form, but it has a length restriction. The quoted
string form is an alternative that avoids the overhead of processing a
literal, but has limitations on the characters that may be
used.[¶](#section-4.3-1){.pilcrow}

When the distinction between synchronizing and non-synchronizing
literals is not important, this document only uses the term
\"literal\".[¶](#section-4.3-2){.pilcrow}

A synchronizing literal is a sequence of zero or more octets (including
CR and LF), prefix-quoted with an octet count in the form of an open
brace (\"{\"), the number of octets, a close brace (\"}\"), and a CRLF.
In the case of synchronizing literals transmitted from server to client,
the CRLF is immediately followed by the octet data. In the case of
synchronizing literals transmitted from client to server, the client
[MUST]{.bcp14} wait to receive a command continuation request (described
later in this document) before sending the octet data (and the remainder
of the command).[¶](#section-4.3-3){.pilcrow}

The non-synchronizing literal is an alternative form of synchronizing
literal and may be used from client to server anywhere a synchronizing
literal is permitted. The non-synchronizing literal form [MUST
NOT]{.bcp14} be sent from server to client. The non-synchronizing
literal is distinguished from the synchronizing literal by having a plus
(\"+\") between the octet count and the closing brace (\"}\"). The
server does not generate a command continuation request in response to a
non-synchronizing literal, and clients are not required to wait before
sending the octets of a non-synchronizing literal. Unless otherwise
specified in an IMAP extension, non-synchronizing literals [MUST
NOT]{.bcp14} be larger than 4096 octets. Any literal larger than 4096
bytes [MUST]{.bcp14} be sent as a synchronizing literal.
(Non-synchronizing literals defined in this document are the same as
non-synchronizing literals defined by the LITERAL- extension from
\[[RFC7888](#RFC7888){.xref}\]. See that document for details on how to
handle invalid non-synchronizing literals longer than 4096 octets and
for interaction with other IMAP
extensions.)[¶](#section-4.3-4){.pilcrow}

A quoted string is a sequence of zero or more Unicode characters,
excluding CR and LF, encoded in UTF-8, with double quote (\<\"\>)
characters at each end.[¶](#section-4.3-5){.pilcrow}

The empty string is represented as \"\" (a quoted string with zero
characters between double quotes), as {0} followed by a CRLF (a
synchronizing literal with an octet count of 0), or as {0+} followed by
a CRLF (a non-synchronizing literal with an octet count of
0).[¶](#section-4.3-6){.pilcrow}

Note: Even if the octet count is 0, a client transmitting a
synchronizing literal [MUST]{.bcp14} wait to receive a command
continuation request.[¶](#section-4.3-7){.pilcrow}

8-bit textual and binary mail is supported through the use of a
\[[MIME-IMB](#RFC2045){.xref}\] content transfer encoding. IMAP4rev2
implementations [MAY]{.bcp14} transmit 8-bit or multi-octet characters
in literals but [SHOULD]{.bcp14} do so only when the
\[[CHARSET](#RFC2978){.xref}\] is
identified.[¶](#section-4.3.1-1){.pilcrow}

IMAP4rev2 is compatible with \[[I18N-HDRS](#RFC6532){.xref}\]. As a
result, the identified charset for header-field values with 8-bit
content is UTF-8 \[[UTF-8](#RFC3629){.xref}\]. IMAP4rev2 implementations
[MUST]{.bcp14} accept and [MAY]{.bcp14} transmit
\[[UTF-8](#RFC3629){.xref}\] text in quoted-strings as long as the
string does not contain NUL, CR, or LF. This differs from IMAP4rev1
implementations.[¶](#section-4.3.1-2){.pilcrow}

Although a BINARY content transfer encoding is defined, unencoded binary
strings are not permitted, unless returned in a \<literal8> in response
to a BINARY.PEEK\[\<section-binary>\]\<\<partial>\> or
BINARY\[\<section-binary>\]\<\<partial>\> FETCH data item. A \"binary
string\" is any string with NUL characters. A string with an excessive
amount of CTL characters [MAY]{.bcp14} also be considered to be binary.
Unless returned in response to BINARY.PEEK\[\...\]/BINARY\[\...\] FETCH,
client and server implementations [MUST]{.bcp14} encode binary data into
a textual form, such as base64, before transmitting the
data.[¶](#section-4.3.1-3){.pilcrow}

data item that is represented as a string or parenthesized list, as
distinct from the empty string \"\" or the empty parenthesized list
().[¶](#section-4.5-1){.pilcrow}

Note: NIL is never used for any data item that takes the form of an
atom. For example, a mailbox name of \"NIL\" is a mailbox named NIL as
opposed to a non-existent mailbox name. This is because mailbox uses
\"astring\" syntax, which is an atom or a string. Conversely, an
addr-name of NIL is a non-existent personal name, because addr-name uses
\"nstring\" syntax, which is NIL or a string, but never an
atom.[¶](#section-4.5-2.1){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-5.1 .section}
### [5.1.](#section-5.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Mailbox Naming](#name-mailbox-naming){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-mailbox-naming}

In IMAP4rev2, mailbox names are encoded in Net-Unicode
\[[NET-UNICODE](#RFC5198){.xref}\] (this differs from IMAP4rev1). Client
implementations [MAY]{.bcp14} attempt to create Net-Unicode mailbox
names and [MUST]{.bcp14} interpret any 8-bit mailbox names returned by
LIST as \[[NET-UNICODE](#RFC5198){.xref}\]. Server implementations
[MUST]{.bcp14} prohibit the creation of 8-bit mailbox names that do not
comply with Net-Unicode. However, servers [MAY]{.bcp14} accept a
denormalized UTF-8 mailbox name and convert it to Unicode Normalization
Form C (NFC) (as per Net-Unicode requirements) prior to mailbox
creation. Servers that choose to accept such denormalized UTF-8 mailbox
names [MUST]{.bcp14} accept them in all IMAP commands that have a
mailbox name parameter. In particular, SELECT \<name> must open the same
mailbox that was successfully created with CREATE \<name>, even if
\<name> is a denormalized UTF-8 mailbox
name.[¶](#section-5.1-1){.pilcrow}

The case-insensitive mailbox name INBOX is a special name reserved to
mean \"the primary mailbox for this user on this server\". (Note that
this special name might not exist on some servers for some users, for
example, if the user has no access to personal namespace.) The
interpretation of all other names is implementation
dependent.[¶](#section-5.1-2){.pilcrow}

In particular, this specification takes no position on case sensitivity
in non-INBOX mailbox names. Some server implementations are fully case
sensitive in ASCII range; others preserve the case of a newly created
name but otherwise are case insensitive; and yet others coerce names to
a particular case. Client implementations must be able to interact with
any of these.[¶](#section-5.1-3){.pilcrow}

There are certain client considerations when creating a new mailbox
name:[¶](#section-5.1-4){.pilcrow}

1.  [Any character that is one of the atom-specials (see \"Formal
    Syntax\" in [Section 9](#IMAP-ABNF){.xref}) will require that the
    mailbox name be represented as a quoted string or
    literal.[¶](#section-5.1-5.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.1-5.1}
2.  [CTL and other non-graphic characters are difficult to represent in
    a user interface and are best avoided. Servers [MAY]{.bcp14} refuse
    to create mailbox names containing Unicode CTL
    characters.[¶](#section-5.1-5.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.1-5.2}
3.  [Although the list-wildcard characters (\"%\" and \"\*\") are valid
    in a mailbox name, it is difficult to use such mailbox names with
    the LIST command due to the conflict with wildcard
    interpretation.[¶](#section-5.1-5.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.1-5.3}
4.  [Usually, a character (determined by the server implementation) is
    reserved to delimit levels of
    hierarchy.[¶](#section-5.1-5.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.1-5.4}
5.  [Two characters, \"#\" and \"&\", have meanings by convention and
    should be avoided except when used in that convention. See [Section
    5.1.2.1](#namespace-convention){.xref} and [Appendix
    A.1](#mailbox-i18n){.xref},
    respectively.[¶](#section-5.1-5.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.1-5.5}

If it is desired to export hierarchical mailbox names, mailbox names
[MUST]{.bcp14} be left-to-right hierarchical, using a single ASCII

Personal Namespace:
:   A namespace that the server considers within the personal scope of
    the authenticated user on a particular connection. Typically, only
    the authenticated user has access to mailboxes in their Personal
    Namespace. It is the part of the namespace that belongs to the user
    and is allocated for mailboxes. If an INBOX exists for a user, it
    [MUST]{.bcp14} appear within the user\'s Personal Namespace. In the

    per user on a server.[¶](#section-5.1.2-1.2){.pilcrow}

Other Users\' Namespace:
:   A namespace that consists of mailboxes from the Personal Namespaces
    of other users. To access mailboxes in the Other Users\' Namespace,
    the currently authenticated user [MUST]{.bcp14} be explicitly
    granted access rights. For example, it is common for a manager to
    grant to their administrative support staff access rights to their
    mailbox. In the typical case, there [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be only one
    Other Users\' Namespace per user on a

By convention, the first hierarchical element of any mailbox name that
begins with \"#\" identifies the \"namespace\" of the remainder of the
name. This makes it possible to disambiguate between different types of
mailbox stores, each of which have their own
namespaces.[¶](#section-5.1.2.1-1){.pilcrow}

For example, implementations that offer access to USENET newsgroups
[MAY]{.bcp14} use the \"#news\" namespace to partition the USENET
newsgroup namespace from that of other mailboxes. Thus, the
comp.mail.misc newsgroup would have a mailbox name of
\"#news.comp.mail.misc\", and the name \"comp.mail.misc\" can refer to a
different object (e.g., a user\'s private
mailbox).[¶](#section-5.1.2.1-2){.pilcrow}

Namespaces that include the \"#\" character are not IMAP URL
\[[IMAP-URL](#RFC5092){.xref}\] friendly and require the \"#\" character

At any time, a server can send data that the client did not request.
Sometimes, such behavior is required by this specification and/or
extensions. For example, agents other than the server may add messages
to the mailbox (e.g., new message delivery); change the flags of the
messages in the mailbox (e.g., simultaneous access to the same mailbox
by multiple agents); or even remove messages from the mailbox. A server
[MUST]{.bcp14} send mailbox size updates automatically if a mailbox size
change is observed during the processing of a command. A server
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} send message flag updates automatically, without
requiring the client to request such updates
explicitly.[¶](#section-5.2-1){.pilcrow}

Special rules exist for server notification of a client about the
removal of messages to prevent synchronization errors; see the
description of the EXPUNGE response ([Section
7.5.1](#expunge-response){.xref}) for more detail. In particular, it is
NOT permitted to send an EXISTS response that would reduce the number of
messages in the mailbox; only the EXPUNGE response can do
this.[¶](#section-5.2-2){.pilcrow}

Regardless of what implementation decisions a client makes on
remembering data from the server, a client implementation [MUST]{.bcp14}
remember mailbox size updates. It [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} assume that any
command after the initial mailbox selection will return the size of the
mailbox.[¶](#section-5.2-3){.pilcrow}

Server implementations are permitted to send an untagged response
(except for EXPUNGE) while there is no command in progress. Server
implementations that send such responses [MUST]{.bcp14} deal with flow
control considerations. Specifically, they [MUST]{.bcp14} either (1)

after authentication, the duration of that timer [MUST]{.bcp14} be at
least 30 minutes. The receipt of any command from the client during that
interval resets the autologout timer.[¶](#section-5.4-1){.pilcrow}

Note that this specification doesn\'t have any restrictions on an

The client [MAY]{.bcp14} send another command without waiting for the
completion result response of a command, subject to ambiguity rules (see
below) and flow control constraints on the underlying data stream.
Similarly, a server [MAY]{.bcp14} begin processing another command
before processing the current command to completion, subject to
ambiguity rules. However, any command continuation request responses and
command continuations [MUST]{.bcp14} be negotiated before any subsequent
command is initiated.[¶](#section-5.5-1){.pilcrow}

The exception is if an ambiguity would result because of a command that
would affect the results of other commands. If the server detects a
possible ambiguity, it [MUST]{.bcp14} execute commands to completion in
the order given by the client.[¶](#section-5.5-2){.pilcrow}

The most obvious example of ambiguity is when a command would affect the
results of another command. One example is a FETCH that would cause
\\Seen flags to be set and a SEARCH UNSEEN
command.[¶](#section-5.5-3){.pilcrow}

A non-obvious ambiguity occurs with commands that permit an untagged
EXPUNGE response (commands other than FETCH, STORE, and SEARCH), since
an untagged EXPUNGE response can invalidate sequence numbers in a
subsequent command. This is not a problem for FETCH, STORE, or SEARCH
commands because servers are prohibited from sending EXPUNGE responses
while any of those commands are in progress. Therefore, if the client
sends any command other than FETCH, STORE, or SEARCH, it [MUST]{.bcp14}
wait for the completion result response before sending a command with
message sequence numbers.[¶](#section-5.5-4){.pilcrow}

Note: EXPUNGE responses are permitted while UID FETCH, UID STORE, and
UID SEARCH are in progress. If the client sends a UID command, it
[MUST]{.bcp14} wait for a completion result response before sending a
command that uses message sequence numbers (this may include UID
SEARCH). Any message sequence numbers in an argument to UID SEARCH are
associated with messages prior to the effect of any untagged EXPUNGE
responses returned by the UID SEARCH.[¶](#section-5.5-5){.pilcrow}

For example, the following non-waiting command sequences are
invalid:[¶](#section-5.5-6){.pilcrow}

-   [FETCH + NOOP +
    STORE[¶](#section-5.5-7.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.5-7.1}
-   [STORE + COPY +
    FETCH[¶](#section-5.5-7.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.5-7.2}
-   [COPY + COPY[¶](#section-5.5-7.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.5-7.3}

The following are examples of valid non-waiting command
sequences:[¶](#section-5.5-8){.pilcrow}

-   [FETCH + STORE + SEARCH +
    NOOP[¶](#section-5.5-9.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.5-9.1}
-   [STORE + COPY +
    EXPUNGE[¶](#section-5.5-9.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.5-9.2}

IMAP4rev2 commands are described in this section. Commands are organized
by the state in which the command is permitted. Commands that are
permitted in multiple states are listed in the minimum permitted state
(for example, commands valid in authenticated and selected states are
listed in the authenticated state commands).[¶](#section-6-1){.pilcrow}

Command arguments, identified by \"Arguments:\" in the command
descriptions below, are described by function, not by syntax. The
precise syntax of command arguments is described in \"Formal Syntax\"
([Section 9](#IMAP-ABNF){.xref}).[¶](#section-6-2){.pilcrow}

Some commands cause specific server responses to be returned; these are
identified by \"Responses:\" in the command descriptions below. See the
response descriptions in \"Responses\" ([Section
7](#server-responses){.xref}) for information on these responses and in
\"Formal Syntax\" ([Section 9](#IMAP-ABNF){.xref}) for the precise
syntax of these responses. It is possible for server data to be
transmitted as a result of any command. Thus, commands that do not
specifically require server data specify \"no specific responses for
this command\" instead of \"none\".[¶](#section-6-3){.pilcrow}

The \"Result:\" in the command description refers to the possible tagged
status responses to a command and any special interpretation of these
status responses.[¶](#section-6-4){.pilcrow}

The state of a connection is only changed by successful commands that
are documented as changing state. A rejected command (BAD response)
never changes the state of the connection or of the selected mailbox. A
failed command (NO response) generally does not change the state of the
connection or of the selected mailbox, with the exception of the SELECT
and EXAMINE commands.[¶](#section-6-5){.pilcrow}

The CAPABILITY command requests a listing of capabilities (e.g.,
extensions and/or modifications of server behavior) that the server
supports. The server [MUST]{.bcp14} send a single untagged CAPABILITY
response with \"IMAP4rev2\" as one of the listed capabilities before the
(tagged) OK response.[¶](#section-6.1.1-2){.pilcrow}

A capability name that begins with \"AUTH=\" indicates that the server
supports that particular authentication mechanism as defined in the
Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL)
\[[SASL](#RFC4422){.xref}\]. All such names are, by definition, part of
this specification.[¶](#section-6.1.1-3){.pilcrow}

Other capability names refer to extensions, revisions, or amendments to
this specification. See the documentation of the CAPABILITY response in
[Section 7.2.2](#capability-resp){.xref} for additional information. If
IMAP4rev1 capability is not advertised, no capabilities, beyond the base
IMAP4rev2 set defined in this specification, are enabled without
explicit client action to invoke the capability. If both IMAP4rev1 and
IMAP4rev2 capabilities are advertised, no capabilities, beyond the base
IMAP4rev1 set specified in \[[RFC3501](#RFC3501){.xref}\], are enabled
without explicit client action to invoke the
capability.[¶](#section-6.1.1-4){.pilcrow}

Client and server implementations [MUST]{.bcp14} implement the STARTTLS
([Section 6.2.1](#STARTTLS){.xref}) and LOGINDISABLED capabilities on
cleartext ports. Client and server implementations [MUST]{.bcp14} also
implement AUTH=PLAIN (described in \[[PLAIN](#RFC4616){.xref}\])
capability on both cleartext and Implicit TLS ports. See the Security
Considerations ([Section 11](#sec-cons){.xref}) for important
information.[¶](#section-6.1.1-5){.pilcrow}

Unless otherwise specified, all registered extensions to IMAP4rev1 are

Since any command can return a status update as untagged data, the NOOP
command can be used as a periodic poll for new messages or message
status updates during a period of inactivity (the IDLE command; see
[Section 6.3.13](#idle){.xref}) should be used instead of NOOP if
real-time updates to mailbox state are desirable). The NOOP command can

In the not authenticated state, the AUTHENTICATE or LOGIN command
establishes authentication and enters the authenticated state. The
AUTHENTICATE command provides a general mechanism for a variety of
authentication techniques, privacy protection, and integrity checking,
whereas the LOGIN command uses a conventional user name and plaintext
password pair and has no means of establishing privacy protection or
integrity checking.[¶](#section-6.2-1){.pilcrow}

The STARTTLS command is an alternative form of establishing session
privacy protection and integrity checking but does not by itself
establish authentication or enter the authenticated
state.[¶](#section-6.2-2){.pilcrow}

Server implementations [MAY]{.bcp14} allow access to certain mailboxes
without establishing authentication. This can be done by means of the
ANONYMOUS \[[SASL](#RFC4422){.xref}\] authenticator described in
\[[ANONYMOUS](#RFC4505){.xref}\]. An older convention is a LOGIN command
using the userid \"anonymous\"; in this case, a password is required
although the server may choose to accept any password. The restrictions
placed on anonymous users are implementation
dependent.[¶](#section-6.2-3){.pilcrow}

Once authenticated (including as anonymous), it is not possible to
re-enter not authenticated state.[¶](#section-6.2-4){.pilcrow}

In addition to the universal commands (CAPABILITY, NOOP, and LOGOUT),
the following commands are valid in the not authenticated state:
STARTTLS, AUTHENTICATE, and LOGIN. See the Security Considerations
([Section 11](#sec-cons){.xref}) for important information about these
commands.[¶](#section-6.2-5){.pilcrow}

Note that the STARTTLS command is available only on cleartext ports. The
server [MUST]{.bcp14} always respond with a tagged BAD response when the
STARTTLS command is received on an Implicit TLS
port.[¶](#section-6.2.1-2){.pilcrow}

A [TLS](#RFC8446){.xref} \[[TLS-1.3](#RFC8446){.xref}\] negotiation
begins immediately after the CRLF at the end of the tagged OK response
from the server. Once a client issues a STARTTLS command, it [MUST
NOT]{.bcp14} issue further commands until a server response is seen and
the TLS negotiation is complete. Some past server implementations
incorrectly implemented STARTTLS processing and are known to contain
STARTTLS plaintext command injection vulnerability
\[[CERT-555316](#CERT-555316){.xref}\]. In order to avoid this
vulnerability, server implementations [MUST]{.bcp14} do one of the
following if any data is received in the same TCP buffer after the CRLF
that starts the STARTTLS command:[¶](#section-6.2.1-3){.pilcrow}

1.  [Extra data from the TCP buffer is interpreted as the beginning of
    the TLS handshake. (If the data is in cleartext, this will result in
    the TLS handshake
    failing.)[¶](#section-6.2.1-4.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.2.1-4.1}
2.  [Extra data from the TCP buffer is thrown
    away.[¶](#section-6.2.1-4.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.2.1-4.2}

Note that the first option is friendlier to clients that pipeline the
beginning of the STARTTLS command with TLS handshake
data.[¶](#section-6.2.1-5){.pilcrow}

After successful TLS negotiation, the server remains in the
non-authenticated state, even if client credentials are supplied during
the TLS negotiation. This does not preclude an authentication mechanism
such as EXTERNAL (defined in \[[SASL](#RFC4422){.xref}\]) from using
client identity determined by the TLS
negotiation.[¶](#section-6.2.1-6){.pilcrow}

Once TLS has been started, the client [MUST]{.bcp14} discard cached
information about server capabilities and [SHOULD]{.bcp14} reissue the
CAPABILITY command. This is necessary to protect against active attacks
that alter the capabilities list prior to STARTTLS. The server
[MAY]{.bcp14} advertise different capabilities and, in particular,
[SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} advertise the STARTTLS capability, after a
successful STARTTLS command.[¶](#section-6.2.1-7){.pilcrow}

:   

The AUTHENTICATE command indicates a \[[SASL](#RFC4422){.xref}\]
authentication mechanism to the server. If the server supports the
requested authentication mechanism, it performs an authentication
protocol exchange to authenticate and identify the client. It
[MAY]{.bcp14} also negotiate an [OPTIONAL]{.bcp14} security layer for
subsequent protocol interactions. If the requested authentication
mechanism is not supported, the server [SHOULD]{.bcp14} reject the
AUTHENTICATE command by sending a tagged NO
response.[¶](#section-6.2.2-2){.pilcrow}

The AUTHENTICATE command supports the optional \"initial response\"
feature defined in [Section
4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4422#section-4){.relref} of
\[[SASL](#RFC4422){.xref}\]. The client doesn\'t need to use it. If a
SASL mechanism supports \"initial response\", but it is not specified by
the client, the server handles it as specified in [Section
3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4422#section-3){.relref} of
\[[SASL](#RFC4422){.xref}\].[¶](#section-6.2.2-3){.pilcrow}

The service name specified by this protocol\'s profile of
\[[SASL](#RFC4422){.xref}\] is \"imap\".[¶](#section-6.2.2-4){.pilcrow}

The authentication protocol exchange consists of a series of server
challenges and client responses that are specific to the authentication
mechanism. A server challenge consists of a command continuation request
response with the \"+\" token followed by a base64-encoded (see [Section
4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4648#section-4){.relref} of
\[[RFC4648](#RFC4648){.xref}\]) string. The client response consists of
a single line consisting of a base64-encoded string. If the client
wishes to cancel an authentication exchange, it issues a line consisting
of a single \"\*\". If the server receives such a response, or if it
receives an invalid base64 string (e.g., characters outside the base64
alphabet or non-terminal \"=\"), it [MUST]{.bcp14} reject the
AUTHENTICATE command by sending a tagged BAD
response.[¶](#section-6.2.2-5){.pilcrow}

As with any other client response, the initial response [MUST]{.bcp14}
be encoded as base64. It also [MUST]{.bcp14} be transmitted outside of a
quoted string or literal. To send a zero-length initial response, the
client [MUST]{.bcp14} send a single pad character (\"=\"). This
indicates that the response is present, but it is a zero-length
string.[¶](#section-6.2.2-6){.pilcrow}

When decoding the base64 data in the initial response, decoding errors
[MUST]{.bcp14} be treated as in any normal SASL client response, i.e.,
with a tagged BAD response. In particular, the server should check for
any characters not explicitly allowed by the base64 alphabet, as well as
any sequence of base64 characters that contains the pad character
(\'=\') anywhere other than the end of the string (e.g., \"=AAA\" and
\"AAA=BBB\" are not allowed).[¶](#section-6.2.2-7){.pilcrow}

If the client uses an initial response with a SASL mechanism that does
not support an initial response, the server [MUST]{.bcp14} reject the
command with a tagged BAD response.[¶](#section-6.2.2-8){.pilcrow}

If a security layer is negotiated through the
\[[SASL](#RFC4422){.xref}\] authentication exchange, it takes effect
immediately following the CRLF that concludes the authentication
exchange for the client and the CRLF of the tagged OK response for the
server.[¶](#section-6.2.2-9){.pilcrow}

While client and server implementations [MUST]{.bcp14} implement the
AUTHENTICATE command itself, it is not required to implement any
authentication mechanisms other than the PLAIN mechanism described in
\[[PLAIN](#RFC4616){.xref}\]. Also, an authentication mechanism is not
required to support any security layers.[¶](#section-6.2.2-10){.pilcrow}

Note: a server implementation [MUST]{.bcp14} implement a configuration
in which it does NOT permit any plaintext password mechanisms, unless
the STARTTLS command has been negotiated, TLS has been negotiated on an
Implicit TLS port, or some other mechanism that protects the session
from password snooping has been provided. Server sites [SHOULD
NOT]{.bcp14} use any configuration that permits a plaintext password
mechanism without such a protection mechanism against password snooping.
Client and server implementations [SHOULD]{.bcp14} implement additional
\[[SASL](#RFC4422){.xref}\] mechanisms that do not use plaintext
passwords, such as the GSSAPI mechanism described in
\[[RFC4752](#RFC4752){.xref}\], the SCRAM-SHA-256/SCRAM-SHA-256-PLUS
\[[SCRAM-SHA-256](#RFC7677){.xref}\] mechanisms, and/or the EXTERNAL
\[[SASL](#RFC4422){.xref}\] mechanism for mutual TLS authentication.
(Note that the SASL framework allows for the creation of SASL mechanisms
that support 2-factor authentication (2FA); however, none are fully
ready to be recommended by this
document.)[¶](#section-6.2.2-11){.pilcrow}

Servers and clients can support multiple authentication mechanisms. The
server [SHOULD]{.bcp14} list its supported authentication mechanisms in
the response to the CAPABILITY command so that the client knows which
authentication mechanisms to use.[¶](#section-6.2.2-12){.pilcrow}

A server [MAY]{.bcp14} include a CAPABILITY response code in the tagged
OK response of a successful AUTHENTICATE command in order to send
capabilities automatically. It is unnecessary for a client to send a
separate CAPABILITY command if it recognizes these automatic
capabilities. This should only be done if a security layer was not
negotiated by the AUTHENTICATE command, because the tagged OK response
as part of an AUTHENTICATE command is not protected by
encryption/integrity checking. \[[SASL](#RFC4422){.xref}\] requires the
client to re-issue a CAPABILITY command in this case. The server
[MAY]{.bcp14} advertise different capabilities after a successful
AUTHENTICATE command.[¶](#section-6.2.2-13){.pilcrow}

If an AUTHENTICATE command fails with a NO response, the client
[MAY]{.bcp14} try another authentication mechanism by issuing another
AUTHENTICATE command. It [MAY]{.bcp14} also attempt to authenticate by
using the LOGIN command (see [Section 6.2.3](#login){.xref} for more
detail). In other words, the client [MAY]{.bcp14} request authentication
types in decreasing order of preference, with the LOGIN command as a
last resort.[¶](#section-6.2.2-14){.pilcrow}

The authorization identity passed from the client to the server during
the authentication exchange is interpreted by the server as the user
name whose privileges the client is
requesting.[¶](#section-6.2.2-15){.pilcrow}

The LOGIN command identifies the client to the server and carries the
plaintext password authenticating this user. The LOGIN command [SHOULD
NOT]{.bcp14} be used except as a last resort (after attempting and
failing to authenticate using the AUTHENTICATE command one or more
times), and it is recommended that client implementations have a means
to disable any automatic use of the LOGIN
command.[¶](#section-6.2.3-2){.pilcrow}

A server [MAY]{.bcp14} include a CAPABILITY response code in the tagged
OK response to a successful LOGIN command in order to send capabilities
automatically. It is unnecessary for a client to send a separate
CAPABILITY command if it recognizes these automatic
capabilities.[¶](#section-6.2.3-3){.pilcrow}

Example:[¶](#section-6.2.3-4){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-6.2.3-5}
``` sourcecode

```

[¶](#section-6.2.3-5){.pilcrow}
:::

Note: Use of the LOGIN command over an insecure network (such as the
Internet) is a security risk, because anyone monitoring network traffic
can obtain plaintext passwords. For that reason, clients [MUST

networks.[¶](#section-6.2.3-6){.pilcrow}

Unless the client is accessing IMAP service on an Implicit TLS port

Several IMAP extensions allow the server to return unsolicited responses
specific to these extensions in certain circumstances. However, servers
cannot send those unsolicited responses (with the exception of response
codes (see [Section 7.1](#server-status-responses){.xref}) included in
tagged or untagged OK/NO/BAD responses, which can always be sent) until
they know that the clients support such extensions and thus will be able
to correctly parse and process the extension response
data.[¶](#section-6.3.1-2){.pilcrow}

The ENABLE command provides an explicit indication from the client that
it supports particular extensions. It is designed such that the client
can send a simple constant string with the extensions it supports, and
the server will enable the shared subset that both
support.[¶](#section-6.3.1-3){.pilcrow}

The ENABLE command takes a list of capability names and requests the
server to enable the named extensions. Once enabled using ENABLE, each
extension remains active until the IMAP connection is closed. For each
argument, the server does the following:[¶](#section-6.3.1-4){.pilcrow}

-   [If the argument is not an extension known to the server, the server
    [MUST]{.bcp14} ignore the
    argument.[¶](#section-6.3.1-5.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.3.1-5.1}
-   [If the argument is an extension known to the server, and it is not
    specifically permitted to be enabled using ENABLE, the server
    [MUST]{.bcp14} ignore the argument. (Note that knowing about an
    extension doesn\'t necessarily imply supporting that
    extension.)[¶](#section-6.3.1-5.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.3.1-5.2}
-   [If the argument is an extension that is supported by the server and
    that needs to be enabled, the server [MUST]{.bcp14} enable the
    extension for the duration of the connection. Note that once an
    extension is enabled, there is no way to disable
    it.[¶](#section-6.3.1-5.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.3.1-5.3}

If the ENABLE command is successful, the server [MUST]{.bcp14} send an
untagged ENABLED response ([Section 7.2.1](#enabled){.xref}), which
includes all enabled extensions as specified above. The ENABLED response
is sent even if no extensions were
enabled.[¶](#section-6.3.1-6){.pilcrow}

Clients [SHOULD]{.bcp14} only include extensions that need to be enabled
by the server. For example, a client can enable IMAP4rev2-specific
behavior when both IMAP4rev1 and IMAP4rev2 are advertised in the
CAPABILITY response. Future RFCs may add to this
list.[¶](#section-6.3.1-7){.pilcrow}

The ENABLE command is only valid in the authenticated state, before any
mailbox is selected. Clients [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} issue ENABLE once they
SELECT/EXAMINE a mailbox; however, server implementations don\'t have to
check that no mailbox is selected or was previously selected during the
duration of a connection.[¶](#section-6.3.1-8){.pilcrow}

The ENABLE command can be issued multiple times in a session. It is
additive; that is, \"ENABLE a b\", followed by \"ENABLE c\", is the same
as a single command \"ENABLE a b c\". When multiple ENABLE commands are
issued, each corresponding ENABLED response [SHOULD]{.bcp14} only
contain extensions enabled by the corresponding ENABLE command, i.e.,
for the above example, the ENABLED response to \"ENABLE c\" should not
contain \"a\" or \"b\".[¶](#section-6.3.1-9){.pilcrow}

There are no limitations on pipelining ENABLE. For example, it is
possible to send ENABLE and then immediately SELECT, or a LOGIN
immediately followed by ENABLE.[¶](#section-6.3.1-10){.pilcrow}

The server [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} change the CAPABILITY list as a result of
executing ENABLE; that is, a CAPABILITY command issued right after an
ENABLE command [MUST]{.bcp14} list the same capabilities as a CAPABILITY
command issued before the ENABLE command. This is demonstrated in the
following example. Note that below \"X-GOOD-IDEA\" is a fictitious
extension capability that can be
ENABLED.[¶](#section-6.3.1-11){.pilcrow}

order of individual responses is not important.) Note that earlier
versions of this protocol, such as the IMAP4rev1 version specified in

Only one mailbox can be selected at a time in a connection; simultaneous
access to multiple mailboxes requires multiple connections. The SELECT
command automatically deselects any currently selected mailbox before
attempting the new selection. Consequently, if a mailbox is selected and
a SELECT command that fails is attempted, no mailbox is selected. When
deselecting a selected mailbox, the server [MUST]{.bcp14} return an
untagged OK response with the \"\[CLOSED\]\" response code when the
currently selected mailbox is closed (see [Section
7.1](#closed){.xref}).[¶](#section-6.3.2-4){.pilcrow}

If the client is permitted to modify the mailbox, the server
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} prefix the text of the tagged OK response with the
\"\[READ-WRITE\]\" response code.[¶](#section-6.3.2-5){.pilcrow}

If the client is not permitted to modify the mailbox but is permitted
read access, the mailbox is selected as read-only, and the server
[MUST]{.bcp14} prefix the text of the tagged OK response to SELECT with
the \"\[READ-ONLY\]\" response code. Read-only access through SELECT
differs from the EXAMINE command in that certain read-only mailboxes
[MAY]{.bcp14} permit the change of permanent state on a per-user (as
opposed to global) basis. Netnews messages marked in a server-based
.newsrc file are an example of such per-user permanent state that can be

The CREATE command creates a mailbox with the given name. An OK response
is returned only if a new mailbox with that name has been created. It is
an error to attempt to create INBOX or a mailbox with a name that refers
to an extant mailbox. Any error in creation will return a tagged NO
response. If a client attempts to create a UTF-8 mailbox name that is
not a valid Net-Unicode name, the server [MUST]{.bcp14} reject the
creation or convert the name to Net-Unicode prior to creating the
mailbox. If the server decides to convert (normalize) the name, it
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} return an untagged LIST with an OLDNAME extended data
item, with the OLDNAME value being the supplied mailbox name and the
name parameter being the normalized mailbox name. (See [Section
6.3.9.7](#oldname){.xref} for more
details.)[¶](#section-6.3.4-2){.pilcrow}

Mailboxes created in one IMAP session [MAY]{.bcp14} be announced to
other IMAP sessions using an unsolicited LIST response. If the server
automatically subscribes a mailbox when it is created, then the
unsolicited LIST response for each affected subscribed mailbox name
[MUST]{.bcp14} include the \\Subscribed
attribute.[¶](#section-6.3.4-3){.pilcrow}

If the mailbox name is suffixed with the server\'s hierarchy separator
character (as returned from the server by a LIST command), this is a
declaration that the client intends to create mailbox names under this
name in the hierarchy. Server implementations that do not require this
declaration [MUST]{.bcp14} ignore the declaration. In any case, the name
created is without the trailing hierarchy
delimiter.[¶](#section-6.3.4-4){.pilcrow}

If the server\'s hierarchy separator character appears elsewhere in the
name, the server [SHOULD]{.bcp14} create any superior hierarchical names
that are needed for the CREATE command to be successfully completed. In
other words, an attempt to create \"foo/bar/zap\" on a server in which
\"/\" is the hierarchy separator character [SHOULD]{.bcp14} create foo/
and foo/bar/ if they do not already
exist.[¶](#section-6.3.4-5){.pilcrow}

If a new mailbox is created with the same name as a mailbox that was
deleted, its unique identifiers [MUST]{.bcp14} be greater than any
unique identifiers used in the previous incarnation of the mailbox

value. See the description of the UID command in [Section

The DELETE command permanently removes the mailbox with the given name.
A tagged OK response is returned only if the mailbox has been deleted.
It is an error to attempt to delete INBOX or a mailbox name that does
not exist.[¶](#section-6.3.5-2){.pilcrow}

The DELETE command [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} remove inferior hierarchical
names. For example, if a mailbox \"foo\" has an inferior \"foo.bar\"
(assuming \".\" is the hierarchy delimiter character), removing \"foo\"
[MUST NOT]{.bcp14} remove \"foo.bar\". It is an error to attempt to
delete a name that has inferior hierarchical names and also has the
\\Noselect mailbox name attribute (see the description of the LIST
response ([Section 7.3.1](#list-resp){.xref}) for more
details).[¶](#section-6.3.5-3){.pilcrow}

It is permitted to delete a name that has inferior hierarchical names
and does not have the \\Noselect mailbox name attribute. If the server
implementation does not permit deleting the name while inferior
hierarchical names exist, then it [SHOULD]{.bcp14} disallow the DELETE
command by returning a tagged NO response. The NO response
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} include the HASCHILDREN response code. Alternatively,
the server [MAY]{.bcp14} allow the DELETE command, but it sets the
\\Noselect mailbox name attribute for that
name.[¶](#section-6.3.5-4){.pilcrow}

If the server returns an OK response, all messages in that mailbox are
removed by the DELETE command.[¶](#section-6.3.5-5){.pilcrow}

The value of the highest-used unique identifier of the deleted mailbox
[MUST]{.bcp14} be preserved so that a new mailbox created with the same
name will not reuse the identifiers of the former incarnation, unless
the new incarnation has a different unique identifier validity value.
See the description of the UID command in [Section
6.4.9](#uid-commands){.xref} for more
detail.[¶](#section-6.3.5-6){.pilcrow}

If the server decides to convert (normalize) the mailbox name, it
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} return an untagged LIST with the \"\\NonExistent\"
attribute and OLDNAME extended data item, with the OLDNAME value being
the supplied mailbox name and the name parameter being the normalized
mailbox name. (See [Section 6.3.9.7](#oldname){.xref} for more

The RENAME command changes the name of a mailbox. A tagged OK response
is returned only if the mailbox has been renamed. It is an error to
attempt to rename from a mailbox name that does not exist or to a
mailbox name that already exists. Any error in renaming will return a
tagged NO response.[¶](#section-6.3.6-2){.pilcrow}

If the name has inferior hierarchical names, then the inferior
hierarchical names [MUST]{.bcp14} also be renamed. For example, a rename
of \"foo\" to \"zap\" will rename \"foo/bar\" (assuming \"/\" is the
hierarchy delimiter character) to
\"zap/bar\".[¶](#section-6.3.6-3){.pilcrow}

If the server\'s hierarchy separator character appears in the new
mailbox name, the server [SHOULD]{.bcp14} create any superior
hierarchical names that are needed for the RENAME command to complete
successfully. In other words, an attempt to rename \"foo/bar/zap\" to
\"baz/rag/zowie\" on a server in which \"/\" is the hierarchy separator
character in the corresponding namespace [SHOULD]{.bcp14} create
\"baz/\" and \"baz/rag/\" if they do not already
exist.[¶](#section-6.3.6-4){.pilcrow}

The value of the highest-used unique identifier of the old mailbox name
[MUST]{.bcp14} be preserved so that a new mailbox created with the same
name will not reuse the identifiers of the former incarnation, unless
the new incarnation has a different unique identifier validity value.
See the description of the UID command in [Section
6.4.9](#uid-commands){.xref} for more
detail.[¶](#section-6.3.6-5){.pilcrow}

Renaming INBOX is permitted and does not result in a tagged BAD
response, and it has special behavior: It moves all messages in INBOX to
a new mailbox with the given name, leaving INBOX empty. If the server
implementation supports inferior hierarchical names of INBOX, these are
unaffected by a rename of INBOX. (Note that some servers disallow
renaming INBOX by returning a tagged NO response, so clients need to be
able to handle the failure of such RENAME
commands.)[¶](#section-6.3.6-6){.pilcrow}

If the server allows creation of mailboxes with names that are not valid
Net-Unicode names, the server normalizes both the existing mailbox name
parameter and the new mailbox name parameter. If the normalized version
of any of these 2 parameters differs from the corresponding supplied
version, the server [SHOULD]{.bcp14} return an untagged LIST response
with an OLDNAME extended data item, with the OLDNAME value being the
supplied existing mailbox name and the name parameter being the
normalized new mailbox name (see [Section 6.3.9.7](#oldname){.xref}).
This would allow the client to correlate the supplied name with the
normalized name.[¶](#section-6.3.6-7){.pilcrow}

Mailboxes renamed in one IMAP session [MAY]{.bcp14} be announced to
other IMAP sessions using an unsolicited LIST response with an OLDNAME
extended data item.[¶](#section-6.3.6-8){.pilcrow}

In both of the above cases, if the server automatically subscribes a
mailbox when it is renamed, then the unsolicited LIST response for each
affected subscribed mailbox name [MUST]{.bcp14} include the \\Subscribed
attribute. No unsolicited LIST responses need to be sent for child
mailboxes. When INBOX is successfully renamed, it is assumed that a new
INBOX is created. No unsolicited LIST responses need to be sent for
INBOX in this case.[¶](#section-6.3.6-9){.pilcrow}

The LIST command returns a subset of mailbox names from the complete set
of all mailbox names available to the client. Zero or more untagged LIST
responses are returned, containing the name attributes, hierarchy
delimiter, name, and possible extension information; see the description
of the LIST response ([Section 7.3.1](#list-resp){.xref}) for more
detail.[¶](#section-6.3.9-2){.pilcrow}

The LIST command [SHOULD]{.bcp14} return its data quickly, without undue
delay. For example, it should not go to excess trouble to calculate the
\\Marked or \\Unmarked status or perform other processing; if each name
requires 1 second of processing, then a list of 1200 names would take 20
minutes![¶](#section-6.3.9-3){.pilcrow}

The extended LIST command, originally introduced in
\[[RFC5258](#RFC5258){.xref}\], provides capabilities beyond that of the
original IMAP LIST command. The extended syntax is being used if one or
more of the following conditions is true:[¶](#section-6.3.9-4){.pilcrow}

1.  [the first word after the command name begins with a parenthesis
    (\"LIST selection
    options\");[¶](#section-6.3.9-5.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.3.9-5.1}
2.  [the second word after the command name begins with a parenthesis;
    and[¶](#section-6.3.9-5.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.3.9-5.2}
3.  [the LIST command has more than 2 parameters (\"LIST return
    options\").[¶](#section-6.3.9-5.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.3.9-5.3}

An empty (\"\" string) reference name argument indicates that the
mailbox name is interpreted as by SELECT. The returned mailbox names
[MUST]{.bcp14} match the supplied mailbox name pattern(s). A non-empty
reference name argument is the name of a mailbox or a level of mailbox
hierarchy, and it indicates the context in which the mailbox name is
interpreted. Clients [SHOULD]{.bcp14} use the empty reference
argument.[¶](#section-6.3.9-6){.pilcrow}

In the basic syntax only, an empty (\"\" string) mailbox name argument
is a special request to return the hierarchy delimiter and the root name
of the name given in the reference. The value returned as the root
[MAY]{.bcp14} be the empty string if the reference is non-rooted or is
an empty string. In all cases, a hierarchy delimiter (or NIL if there is
no hierarchy) is returned. This permits a client to get the hierarchy
delimiter (or find out that the mailbox names are flat) even when no
mailboxes by that name currently exist.[¶](#section-6.3.9-7){.pilcrow}

In the extended syntax, any mailbox name arguments that are empty
strings are ignored. There is no special meaning for empty mailbox names
when the extended syntax is used.[¶](#section-6.3.9-8){.pilcrow}

The reference and mailbox name arguments are interpreted into a
canonical form that represents an unambiguous left-to-right hierarchy.
The returned mailbox names will be in the interpreted form, which we
call a \"canonical LIST pattern\": the canonical pattern constructed
internally by the server from the reference and mailbox name
arguments.[¶](#section-6.3.9-9){.pilcrow}

Note: The interpretation of the reference argument is implementation
defined. It depends on whether the server implementation has a concept
of the \"current working directory\" and leading \"break out
characters\", which override the current working
directory.[¶](#section-6.3.9-10){.pilcrow}

For example, on a server that exports a UNIX or NT file system, the
reference argument contains the current working directory, and the
mailbox name argument contains the name as interpreted in the current
working directory.[¶](#section-6.3.9-11){.pilcrow}

If a server implementation has no concept of break out characters, the
canonical form is normally the reference name appended with the mailbox
name. Note that if the server implements the namespace convention
([Section 5.1.2.1](#namespace-convention){.xref}), \"#\" is a break out
character and must be treated as such.[¶](#section-6.3.9-12){.pilcrow}

If the reference argument is not a level of mailbox hierarchy (that is,
it is a \\NoInferiors name), and/or the reference argument does not end
with the hierarchy delimiter, it is interpreted as implementation
dependent. For example, a reference of \"foo/bar\" and mailbox name of
\"rag/baz\" could be interpreted as \"foo/bar/rag/baz\",
\"foo/barrag/baz\", or \"foo/rag/baz\". A client [SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14}
use such a reference argument except at the explicit request of the
user. A hierarchical browser [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} make any assumptions
about server interpretation of the reference unless the reference is a
level of mailbox hierarchy AND ends with the hierarchy
delimiter.[¶](#section-6.3.9-13){.pilcrow}

Any part of the reference argument that is included in the interpreted
form [SHOULD]{.bcp14} prefix the interpreted form. It [SHOULD]{.bcp14}
also be in the same form as the reference name argument. This rule
permits the client to determine if the returned mailbox name is in the
context of the reference argument or if something about the mailbox
argument overrode the reference argument. Without this rule, the client
would have to have knowledge of the server\'s naming semantics including
what characters are \"breakouts\" that override a naming
context.[¶](#section-6.3.9-14){.pilcrow}

Here are some examples of how references and mailbox names might be
interpreted on a UNIX-based server:[¶](#section-6.3.9-15){.pilcrow}

::: {#table_1}
  Reference       Mailbox Name     Interpretation
  --------------- ---------------- ---------------------
  \~smith/Mail/   foo.\*           \~smith/Mail/foo.\*
  archive/        \%               archive/%
  #news.          comp.mail.\*     #news.comp.mail.\*
  \~smith/Mail/   /usr/doc/foo     /usr/doc/foo
  archive/        \~fred/Mail/\*   \~fred/Mail/\*

  : [Table 1](#table-1){.selfRef}
:::

The first three examples above demonstrate interpretations in the
context of the reference argument. Note that \"\~smith/Mail\" [SHOULD
NOT]{.bcp14} be transformed into something like
\"/u2/users/smith/Mail\", or it would be impossible for the client to
determine that the interpretation was in the context of the
reference.[¶](#section-6.3.9-17){.pilcrow}

The character \"\*\" is a wildcard and matches zero or more characters
at this position. The character \"%\" is similar to \"\*\", but it does
not match a hierarchy delimiter. If the \"%\" wildcard is the last
character of a mailbox name argument, matching levels of hierarchy are
also returned. If these levels of hierarchy are not also selectable
mailboxes, they are returned with the \\Noselect mailbox name attribute
(see the description of the LIST response ([Section
7.3.1](#list-resp){.xref}) for more
details).[¶](#section-6.3.9-18){.pilcrow}

Any syntactically valid pattern that is not accepted by a server for any
reason [MUST]{.bcp14} be silently ignored, i.e., it results in no LIST
responses, and the LIST command still returns a tagged OK
response.[¶](#section-6.3.9-19){.pilcrow}

Selection options tell the server to limit the mailbox names that are
selected by the LIST operation. If selection options are used, the
mailboxes returned are those that match both the list of canonical LIST
patterns and the selection options. Unless a particular selection option
provides special rules, the selection options are cumulative: a mailbox
that matches the mailbox patterns is selected only if it also matches
all of the selection options. (An example of a selection option with
special rules is the RECURSIVEMATCH
option.)[¶](#section-6.3.9-20){.pilcrow}

Return options control what information is returned for each matched
mailbox. Return options [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} cause the server to report
information about additional mailbox names other than those that match
the canonical LIST patterns and selection options. If no return options
are specified, the client is only expecting information about mailbox
attributes. The server [MAY]{.bcp14} return other information about the
matched mailboxes, and clients [MUST]{.bcp14} be able to handle that
situation.[¶](#section-6.3.9-21){.pilcrow}

Initial selection options and return options are defined in the
following subsections, and new ones will also be defined in extensions.
Initial options defined in this document [MUST]{.bcp14} be supported.
Each non-initial option will be enabled by a capability string (one
capability may enable multiple options), and a client [MUST NOT]{.bcp14}
send an option for which the server has not advertised support. A server
[MUST]{.bcp14} respond to options it does not recognize with a BAD
response. The client [SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} specify any option more than
once; however, if the client does this, the server [MUST]{.bcp14} act as
if it received the option only once. The order in which options are
specified by the client is not
significant.[¶](#section-6.3.9-22){.pilcrow}

In general, each selection option except RECURSIVEMATCH will have a
corresponding return option with the same name. The REMOTE selection
option is an anomaly in this regard and does not have a corresponding
return option. That is because it expands, rather than restricts, the
set of mailboxes that are returned. Future extensions to this
specification should keep this parallelism in mind and define a pair of
corresponding selection and return
options.[¶](#section-6.3.9-23){.pilcrow}

Server implementations are permitted to \"hide\" otherwise accessible
mailboxes from the wildcard characters, by preventing certain characters
or names from matching a wildcard in certain situations. For example, a
UNIX-based server might restrict the interpretation of \"\*\" so that an
initial \"/\" character does not match.[¶](#section-6.3.9-24){.pilcrow}

The special name INBOX is included in the output from LIST, if INBOX is
supported by this server for this user and if the uppercase string
\"INBOX\" matches the interpreted reference and mailbox name arguments
with wildcards as described above. The criteria for omitting INBOX is
whether SELECT INBOX will return a failure; it is not relevant whether
the user\'s real INBOX resides on this or some other
server.[¶](#section-6.3.9-25){.pilcrow}

SUBSCRIBED

:   Causes the LIST command to list subscribed names rather than the
    existing mailboxes. This will often be a subset of the actual
    mailboxes. It\'s also possible for this list to contain the names of
    mailboxes that don\'t exist. In any case, the list [MUST]{.bcp14}
    include exactly those mailbox names that match the canonical list
    pattern and are subscribed to.[¶](#section-6.3.9.1-2.2.1){.pilcrow}

    This option defines a mailbox attribute, \"\\Subscribed\", that
    indicates that a mailbox name is subscribed to. The \"\\Subscribed\"
    attribute [MUST]{.bcp14} be supported and [MUST]{.bcp14} be
    accurately computed when the SUBSCRIBED selection option is
    specified.[¶](#section-6.3.9.1-2.2.2){.pilcrow}

    return option (see below).[¶](#section-6.3.9.1-2.2.3){.pilcrow}

:   

REMOTE

:   Causes the LIST command to show remote mailboxes as well as local
    ones, as described in \[[RFC2193](#RFC2193){.xref}\]. This option is
    intended to replace the RLIST command and, in conjunction with the
    SUBSCRIBED selection option, the RLSUB command. Servers that don\'t
    support the concept of remote mailboxes can ignore this
    option.[¶](#section-6.3.9.1-2.4.1){.pilcrow}

    This option defines a mailbox attribute, \"\\Remote\", that
    indicates that a mailbox is a remote mailbox. The \"\\Remote\"
    attribute [MUST]{.bcp14} be accurately computed when the REMOTE
    option is specified.[¶](#section-6.3.9.1-2.4.2){.pilcrow}

    The REMOTE selection option has no interaction with other options.
    Its effect is to tell the server to apply the other options, if any,
    to remote mailboxes, in addition to local ones. In particular, it
    has no interaction with RECURSIVEMATCH (see below). A request for
    (REMOTE RECURSIVEMATCH) is invalid, because a request for
    (RECURSIVEMATCH) is also invalid. A request for (REMOTE
    RECURSIVEMATCH SUBSCRIBED) is asking for all subscribed mailboxes,
    both local and remote.[¶](#section-6.3.9.1-2.4.3){.pilcrow}

:   

RECURSIVEMATCH

:   Forces the server to return information about parent mailboxes that
    don\'t match other selection options but have some submailboxes that
    do. Information about children is returned in the CHILDINFO extended
    data item, as described in [Section

SUBSCRIBED

:   Causes the LIST command to return subscription state for all

    computed when the SUBSCRIBED return option is specified.
    Furthermore, all other mailbox attributes [MUST]{.bcp14} be

    above requirements don\'t override the requirement for the LIST
    command to return results quickly (see [Section

    compute results quickly and accurately. For example, server
    implementors might need to create quick access

STATUS

:   Requests STATUS response for each matching
    mailbox.[¶](#section-6.3.9.2-2.6.1){.pilcrow}

    This option takes STATUS data items as parameters. For each
    selectable mailbox matching the list pattern and selection options,
    the server [MUST]{.bcp14} return an untagged LIST response followed
    by an untagged STATUS response containing the information requested
    in the STATUS return option, except for some cases described
    below.[¶](#section-6.3.9.2-2.6.2){.pilcrow}

    If an attempted STATUS for a listed mailbox fails because the
    mailbox can\'t be selected (e.g., if the \"l\" Access Control List
    (ACL) right \[[RFC4314](#RFC4314){.xref}\] is granted to the mailbox
    and the \"r\" right is not granted, or is due to a race condition
    between LIST and STATUS changing the mailbox to \\NoSelect), the
    STATUS response [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be returned, and the LIST
    response [MUST]{.bcp14} include the \\NoSelect attribute. This means
    the server may have to buffer the LIST reply until it has
    successfully looked up the necessary STATUS
    information.[¶](#section-6.3.9.2-2.6.3){.pilcrow}

    If the server runs into unexpected problems while trying to look up
    the STATUS information, it [MAY]{.bcp14} drop the corresponding
    STATUS reply. In such a situation, the LIST command would still
    return a tagged OK reply.[¶](#section-6.3.9.2-2.6.4){.pilcrow}

should be returned, as well as how many responses and what kind of
information they may contain.[¶](#section-6.3.9.3-1){.pilcrow}

1.  [At most, one LIST response should be returned for each mailbox name
    that matches the canonical LIST pattern. Server implementors must
    not assume that clients will be able to assemble mailbox attributes
    and other information returned in multiple LIST
    responses.[¶](#section-6.3.9.3-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.3.9.3-2.1}

2.  ::: {#section-6.3.9.3-2.2}
    There are only two reasons for including a matching mailbox name in
    the responses to the LIST command (note that the server is allowed
    to return unsolicited responses at any time, and such responses are
    not governed by this rule):[¶](#section-6.3.9.3-2.2.1){.pilcrow}

    A.  [The mailbox name also satisfies the selection
        criteria.[¶](#section-6.3.9.3-2.2.2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.3.9.3-2.2.2.1}

    B.  ::: {#section-6.3.9.3-2.2.2.2}
        The mailbox name doesn\'t satisfy the selection criteria, but it
        has at least one descendant mailbox name that satisfies the
        selection criteria and that doesn\'t match the canonical LIST
        pattern.[¶](#section-6.3.9.3-2.2.2.2.1){.pilcrow}

        For more information on this case, see the CHILDINFO extended
        data item described in [Section 6.3.9.6](#childinfo){.xref}.

The CHILDREN return option is simply an indication that the client wants
information about whether or not mailboxes contain child mailboxes; a
server [MAY]{.bcp14} provide it even if the option is not
specified.[¶](#section-6.3.9.5-1){.pilcrow}

Many IMAP clients present the user with a hierarchical view of the
mailboxes that a user has access to. Rather than initially presenting
the entire mailbox hierarchy to the user, it is often preferable to show
the user a collapsed outline list of the mailbox hierarchy (particularly
if there is a large number of mailboxes). The user can then expand the
collapsed outline hierarchy as needed. It is common to include a visual
clue (such as a \'\'+\'\') within the collapsed hierarchy to indicate
that there are child mailboxes under a particular mailbox. When the
visual clue is clicked, the hierarchy list is expanded to show the child
mailboxes. The CHILDREN return option provides a mechanism for a client
to efficiently determine whether a particular mailbox has children,
without issuing a LIST \"\" \* or a LIST \"\" % for each mailbox name.
The CHILDREN return option defines two new attributes that
[MUST]{.bcp14} be returned within a LIST response: \\HasChildren and
\\HasNoChildren. Although these attributes [MAY]{.bcp14} be returned in
response to any LIST command, the CHILDREN return option is provided to
indicate that the client particularly wants this information. If the
CHILDREN return option is present, the server [MUST]{.bcp14} return
these attributes even if their computation is
expensive.[¶](#section-6.3.9.5-2){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

\\HasChildren
:   The presence of this attribute indicates that the mailbox has child
    mailboxes. A server [SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} set this attribute if there
    are child mailboxes and the user does not have permission to access
    any of them. In this case, \\HasNoChildren [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be used.
    In many cases, however, a server may not be able to efficiently
    compute whether a user has access to any child mailbox. Note that
    even though the \\HasChildren attribute for a mailbox must be
    correct at the time of processing the mailbox, a client must be
    prepared to deal with a situation when a mailbox is marked with the
    \\HasChildren attribute, but no child mailbox appears in the
    response to the LIST command. This might happen, for example, due to
    child mailboxes being deleted or made inaccessible to the user
    (using access control) by another client before the server is able
    to list them.[¶](#section-6.3.9.5-3.2){.pilcrow}

    child mailboxes that are accessible to the currently authenticated

It is an error for the server to return both a \\HasChildren and a
\\HasNoChildren attribute in the same LIST
response.[¶](#section-6.3.9.5-4){.pilcrow}

The CHILDINFO extended data item [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be returned unless
the client has specified the RECURSIVEMATCH selection
option.[¶](#section-6.3.9.6-1){.pilcrow}

The CHILDINFO extended data item in a LIST response describes the
selection criteria that has caused it to be returned and indicates that
the mailbox has at least one descendant mailbox that matches the
selection criteria.[¶](#section-6.3.9.6-2){.pilcrow}

Note: Some servers allow for mailboxes to exist without requiring their
parent to exist. For example, the mailbox \"Customers/ABC\" can exist
while the mailbox \"Customers\" does not. As the CHILDINFO extended data
item is not allowed if the RECURSIVEMATCH selection option is not
specified, such servers [SHOULD]{.bcp14} use the \"\\NonExistent
\\HasChildren\" attribute pair to signal to the client that there is a
descendant mailbox that matches the selection criteria. See Example 11
in [Section 6.3.9.8](#examples){.xref}.[¶](#section-6.3.9.6-3){.pilcrow}

The returned selection criteria allows the client to distinguish a
solicited response from an unsolicited one, as well as to distinguish
among solicited responses caused by multiple pipelined LIST commands
that specify different criteria.[¶](#section-6.3.9.6-4){.pilcrow}

Servers [SHOULD]{.bcp14} only return a non-matching mailbox name along

returned. That is, servers [SHOULD]{.bcp14} suppress redundant CHILDINFO
responses.[¶](#section-6.3.9.6-5){.pilcrow}

Although a server will typically support only a single Personal

where there [MAY]{.bcp14} be multiples of these, and a client
[MUST]{.bcp14} be prepared for them. If a client is configured such that
it is required to create a certain mailbox, there can be circumstances
where it is unclear which Personal Namespaces it should create the
mailbox in. In these situations, a client [SHOULD]{.bcp14} let the user
select which namespaces to create the mailbox in, or just use the first
Personal Namespace.[¶](#section-6.3.10-21){.pilcrow}

Example 6:[¶](#section-6.3.10-22){.pilcrow}

In this example, a server supports two Personal Namespaces. In addition
to the regular Personal Namespace, the user has an additional Personal
Namespace that allows access to mailboxes in an MH format
mailstore.[¶](#section-6.3.10-23){.pilcrow}

The client is configured to save a copy of all mail sent by the user
into a mailbox with the \\Sent attribute (see [Section
7.3.1](#list-resp){.xref}). Furthermore, after a message is deleted from
a mailbox, the client is configured to move that message to a mailbox
with the \\Trash attribute. The server signals with the \\NonExistent
mailbox attribute that the corresponding mailboxes don\'t exist yet and
that it is possible to create them. Once created, they could be used for
\\Sent or \\Trash purposes, and the server will no longer include the
\\NonExistent mailbox attribute for
them.[¶](#section-6.3.10-24){.pilcrow}

The STATUS command requests the status of the indicated mailbox. It does
not change the currently selected mailbox, nor does it affect the state
of any messages in the queried mailbox.[¶](#section-6.3.11-2){.pilcrow}

The STATUS command provides an alternative to opening a second IMAP4rev2
connection and doing an EXAMINE command on a mailbox to query that
mailbox\'s status without deselecting the current mailbox in the first
IMAP4rev2 connection.[¶](#section-6.3.11-3){.pilcrow}

Unlike the LIST command, the STATUS command is not guaranteed to be fast
in its response. Under certain circumstances, it can be quite slow. In
some implementations, the server is obliged to open the mailbox as
\"read-only\" internally to obtain certain status information. Also
unlike the LIST command, the STATUS command does not accept
wildcards.[¶](#section-6.3.11-4){.pilcrow}

Note: The STATUS command is intended to access the status of mailboxes
other than the currently selected mailbox. Because the STATUS command
can cause the mailbox to be opened internally, and because this
information is available by other means on the selected mailbox, the
STATUS command [SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} be used on the currently selected
mailbox. However, servers [MUST]{.bcp14} be able to execute the STATUS
command on the selected mailbox. (This might also implicitly happen when
the STATUS return option is used in a LIST
command.)[¶](#section-6.3.11-5){.pilcrow}

The STATUS command [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be used as a \"check for new
messages in the selected mailbox\" operation (refer to Sections
[7](#server-responses){.xref} and [7.4.1](#exists){.xref} for more
information about the proper method for new message
checking).[¶](#section-6.3.11-6){.pilcrow}

The APPEND command appends the literal argument as a new message to the
end of the specified destination mailbox. This argument [SHOULD]{.bcp14}
be in the format of an \[[RFC5322](#RFC5322){.xref}\] or
\[[I18N-HDRS](#RFC6532){.xref}\] message. 8-bit characters are permitted
in the message. A server implementation that is unable to preserve 8-bit
data properly [MUST]{.bcp14} be able to reversibly convert 8-bit APPEND
data to 7 bits using a \[[MIME-IMB](#RFC2045){.xref}\] content transfer
encoding.[¶](#section-6.3.12-2){.pilcrow}

Note: There may be exceptions, such as draft messages, in which required
\[[RFC5322](#RFC5322){.xref}\] header fields are omitted in the message
literal argument to APPEND. The full implications of doing so must be
understood and carefully weighed.[¶](#section-6.3.12-3){.pilcrow}

If a flag parenthesized list is specified, the flags [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be
set in the resulting message; otherwise, the flag list of the resulting
message is set to \"empty\" by default.[¶](#section-6.3.12-4){.pilcrow}

If a date-time is specified, the internal date [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be set
in the resulting message; otherwise, the internal date of the resulting
message is set to the current date and time by
default.[¶](#section-6.3.12-5){.pilcrow}

If the append is unsuccessful for any reason, the mailbox [MUST]{.bcp14}
be restored to its state before the APPEND attempt (other than possibly
keeping the changed mailbox\'s UIDNEXT value); no partial appending is
permitted.[¶](#section-6.3.12-6){.pilcrow}

If the destination mailbox does not exist, a server [MUST]{.bcp14}
return an error and [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} automatically create the mailbox.
Unless it is certain that the destination mailbox cannot be created, the
server [MUST]{.bcp14} send the response code \"\[TRYCREATE\]\" as the
prefix of the text of the tagged NO response. This gives a hint to the
client that it can attempt a CREATE command and retry the APPEND if the
CREATE is successful.[¶](#section-6.3.12-7){.pilcrow}

On successful completion of an APPEND, the server returns an APPENDUID
response code (see [Section 7.1](#server-status-responses){.xref}),
unless otherwise specified below.[¶](#section-6.3.12-8){.pilcrow}

In the case of a mailbox that has permissions set so that the client can
APPEND to the mailbox, but not SELECT or EXAMINE it, the server [MUST
NOT]{.bcp14} send an APPENDUID response code as it would disclose
information about the mailbox.[¶](#section-6.3.12-9){.pilcrow}

In the case of a mailbox that has UIDNOTSTICKY status (see [Section
7.1](#server-status-responses){.xref}), the server [MAY]{.bcp14} omit
the APPENDUID response code as it is not
meaningful.[¶](#section-6.3.12-10){.pilcrow}

If the mailbox is currently selected, normal new message actions
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} occur. Specifically, the server [SHOULD]{.bcp14} notify
the client immediately via an untagged EXISTS response. If the server
does not do so, the client [MAY]{.bcp14} issue a NOOP command after one
or more APPEND commands.[¶](#section-6.3.12-11){.pilcrow}

If the server decides to convert (normalize) the mailbox name, it
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} return an untagged LIST with an OLDNAME extended data
item, with the OLDNAME value being the supplied mailbox name and the
name parameter being the normalized mailbox name. (See [Section
6.3.9.7](#oldname){.xref} for more
details.)[¶](#section-6.3.12-12){.pilcrow}

In this example, A003 and A004 demonstrate successful appending and
copying to a mailbox that returns the UIDs assigned to the messages.
A005 is an example in which no messages were copied; this is because in
A003, we see that message 2 had UID 304, and message 3 had UID 319;
therefore, UIDs 305 through 310 do not exist (refer to [Section

of a message being copied that did not return a COPYUID; and, as

Without the IDLE command, a client would need to poll the server for
changes to the selected mailbox (new mail, deletions, and flag changes).
It\'s often more desirable to have the server transmit updates to the
client in real time. This allows a user to see new mail immediately. The
IDLE command allows a client to tell the server that it\'s ready to
accept such real-time updates.[¶](#section-6.3.13-2){.pilcrow}

The IDLE command is sent from the client to the server when the client
is ready to accept unsolicited update messages. The server requests a
response to the IDLE command using the continuation (\"+\") response.
The IDLE command remains active until the client responds to the
continuation, and as long as an IDLE command is active, the server is
now free to send untagged EXISTS, EXPUNGE, FETCH, and other responses at
any time. If the server chooses to send unsolicited FETCH responses,
they [MUST]{.bcp14} include a UID FETCH
item.[¶](#section-6.3.13-3){.pilcrow}

The IDLE command is terminated by the receipt of a \"DONE\" continuation
from the client; such response satisfies the server\'s continuation
request. At that point, the server [MAY]{.bcp14} send any remaining
queued untagged responses and then [MUST]{.bcp14} immediately send the
tagged response to the IDLE command and prepare to process other
commands. As for other commands, the processing of any new command may
cause the sending of unsolicited untagged responses, subject to the
ambiguity limitations. The client [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} send a command
while the server is waiting for the DONE, since the server will not be
able to distinguish a command from a
continuation.[¶](#section-6.3.13-4){.pilcrow}

The server [MAY]{.bcp14} consider a client inactive if it has an IDLE
command running, and if such a server has an inactivity timeout, it
[MAY]{.bcp14} log the client off implicitly at the end of its timeout
period. Because of that, clients using IDLE are advised to terminate
IDLE and reissue it at least every 29 minutes to avoid being logged off.
This still allows a client to receive immediate mailbox updates even
though it need only \"poll\" at half hour
intervals.[¶](#section-6.3.13-5){.pilcrow}

The CLOSE command permanently removes all messages that have the
\\Deleted flag set from the currently selected mailbox, and it returns
to the authenticated state from the selected state. No untagged EXPUNGE
responses are sent.[¶](#section-6.4.1-2){.pilcrow}

No messages are removed, and no error is given, if the mailbox is
selected by an EXAMINE command or is otherwise selected as
read-only.[¶](#section-6.4.1-3){.pilcrow}

Even if a mailbox is selected, a SELECT, EXAMINE, or LOGOUT command
[MAY]{.bcp14} be issued without previously issuing a CLOSE command. The
SELECT, EXAMINE, and LOGOUT commands implicitly close the currently
selected mailbox without doing an expunge. However, when many messages
are deleted, a CLOSE-LOGOUT or CLOSE-SELECT sequence is considerably
faster than an EXPUNGE-LOGOUT or EXPUNGE-SELECT because no untagged
EXPUNGE responses (which the client would probably ignore) are
sent.[¶](#section-6.4.1-4){.pilcrow}

The SEARCH command searches the mailbox for messages that match the
given searching criteria.[¶](#section-6.4.4-2){.pilcrow}

The SEARCH command may contain result options. Result options control
what kind of information is returned about messages matching the search
criteria in an untagged ESEARCH response. If no result option is
specified or empty list of options is specified as \"()\", ALL is
assumed (see below). The order of individual options is arbitrary.
Individual options may contain parameters enclosed in parentheses.
(However, if an option has a mandatory parameter, which can always be
represented as a number or a sequence-set, the option parameter does not
need the enclosing parentheses. See \"Formal Syntax\" ([Section
9](#IMAP-ABNF){.xref}) for more details.) If an option has parameters,
they consist of atoms and/or strings and/or lists in a specific order.
Any options not defined by extensions that the server supports
[MUST]{.bcp14} be rejected with a BAD
response.[¶](#section-6.4.4-3){.pilcrow}

Note that IMAP4rev1 used SEARCH responses \[[RFC3501](#RFC3501){.xref}\]
instead of ESEARCH responses. Clients that support only IMAP4rev2
[MUST]{.bcp14} ignore SEARCH responses.[¶](#section-6.4.4-4){.pilcrow}

This document specifies the following result
options:[¶](#section-6.4.4-5){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

MIN

:   []{#iref-min-search-result-option-62 .iref} Return the lowest
    message number/UID that satisfies the SEARCH
    criteria.[¶](#section-6.4.4-6.2.1){.pilcrow}

    If the SEARCH results in no matches, the server [MUST NOT]{.bcp14}
    include the MIN result option in the ESEARCH response; however, it
    still [MUST]{.bcp14} send the ESEARCH
    response.[¶](#section-6.4.4-6.2.2){.pilcrow}

:   

MAX

:   []{#iref-max-search-result-option-63 .iref} Return the highest
    message number/UID that satisfies the SEARCH
    criteria.[¶](#section-6.4.4-6.4.1){.pilcrow}

    If the SEARCH results in no matches, the server [MUST NOT]{.bcp14}
    include the MAX result option in the ESEARCH response; however, it
    still [MUST]{.bcp14} send the ESEARCH
    response.[¶](#section-6.4.4-6.4.2){.pilcrow}

:   

ALL

:   []{#iref-all-search-result-option-64 .iref} Return all message
    numbers/UIDs that satisfy the SEARCH criteria using the sequence-set
    syntax. Note that the client [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} assume that
    messages/UIDs will be listed in any particular
    order.[¶](#section-6.4.4-6.6.1){.pilcrow}

    If the SEARCH results in no matches, the server [MUST NOT]{.bcp14}
    include the ALL result option in the ESEARCH response; however, it
    still [MUST]{.bcp14} send the ESEARCH
    response.[¶](#section-6.4.4-6.6.2){.pilcrow}

:   

COUNT
:   []{#iref-count-search-result-option- .iref} Return the number of
    messages that satisfy the SEARCH criteria. This result option
    [MUST]{.bcp14} always be included in the ESEARCH
    response.[¶](#section-6.4.4-6.8){.pilcrow}
:   

SAVE

:   []{#iref-save-search-result-option-6 .iref} This option tells the
    server to remember the result of the SEARCH or UID SEARCH command
    (as well as any command based on SEARCH, e.g., SORT and THREAD
    \[[RFC5256](#RFC5256){.xref}\]) and store it in an internal variable
    that we will reference as the \"search result variable\". The client
    can use the \"\$\" marker to reference the content of this internal
    variable. The \"\$\" marker can be used instead of message sequence
    or UID sequence in order to indicate that the server should
    substitute it with the list of messages from the search result
    variable. Thus, the client can use the result of the latest
    remembered SEARCH command as a parameter to another command. See
    [Section 6.4.4.1](#search-save){.xref} for details on how the value
    of the search result variable is determined, how it is affected by
    other commands executed, and how the SAVE return option interacts
    with other return options.[¶](#section-6.4.4-6.10.1){.pilcrow}

    In absence of any other SEARCH result option, the SAVE result option
    also suppresses any ESEARCH response that would have been otherwise
    returned by the SEARCH command.[¶](#section-6.4.4-6.10.2){.pilcrow}

:   

Note: future extensions to this document can allow servers to return
multiple ESEARCH responses for a single extended SEARCH command.
However, all options specified above [MUST]{.bcp14} result in a single
ESEARCH response if used by themselves or in combination. This guarantee
simplifies processing in IMAP4rev2 clients. Future SEARCH extensions
that relax this restriction will have to describe how results from
multiple ESEARCH responses are to be
combined.[¶](#section-6.4.4-7){.pilcrow}

Searching criteria consist of one or more search
keys.[¶](#section-6.4.4-8){.pilcrow}

When multiple keys are specified, the result is the intersection (AND
function) of all the messages that match those keys. For example, the
criteria DELETED FROM \"SMITH\" SINCE 1-Feb-1994 refers to all deleted
messages from Smith with INTERNALDATE greater than February 1, 1994. A
search key can also be a parenthesized list of one or more search keys
(e.g., for use with the OR and NOT keys).[¶](#section-6.4.4-9){.pilcrow}

Server implementations [MAY]{.bcp14} exclude
\[[MIME-IMB](#RFC2045){.xref}\] body parts with terminal content media
types other than TEXT and MESSAGE from consideration in SEARCH
matching.[¶](#section-6.4.4-10){.pilcrow}

The [OPTIONAL]{.bcp14} \[[CHARSET](#RFC2978){.xref}\] specification
consists of the word \"CHARSET\" followed by the name of a character set
from the registry \[[CHARSET-REG](#CHARSET-REG){.xref}\]. It indicates
the \[[CHARSET](#RFC2978){.xref}\] of the strings that appear in the
search criteria. \[[MIME-IMB](#RFC2045){.xref}\] content transfer
encodings and \[[MIME-HDRS](#RFC2047){.xref}\] strings in
\[[RFC5322](#RFC5322){.xref}\]/\[[MIME-IMB](#RFC2045){.xref}\] headers
[MUST]{.bcp14} be decoded before comparing text. Servers [MUST]{.bcp14}
support US-ASCII and UTF-8 charsets; other CHARSETs [MAY]{.bcp14} be
supported. Clients [SHOULD]{.bcp14} use UTF-8. Note that if CHARSET is
not provided, IMAP4rev2 servers [MUST]{.bcp14} assume UTF-8, so
selecting CHARSET UTF-8 is redundant. It is permitted for improved
compatibility with existing IMAP4rev1
clients.[¶](#section-6.4.4-11){.pilcrow}

If the server does not support the specified
\[[CHARSET](#RFC2978){.xref}\], it [MUST]{.bcp14} return a tagged NO
response (not a BAD). This response [SHOULD]{.bcp14} contain the
BADCHARSET response code, which [MAY]{.bcp14} list the CHARSETs
supported by the server.[¶](#section-6.4.4-12){.pilcrow}

In all search keys that use strings, and unless otherwise specified, a
message matches the key if the string is a substring of the associated
text. The matching [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be case insensitive for characters
within the ASCII range. Consider using \[[IMAP-I18N](#RFC5255){.xref}\]
for language-sensitive, case-insensitive searching. Note that the empty
string is a substring; this is useful when performing a HEADER search in
order to test for a header field presence in the
message.[¶](#section-6.4.4-13){.pilcrow}

The defined search keys are as follows. Refer to \"Formal Syntax\"
([Section 9](#IMAP-ABNF){.xref}) for the precise syntactic definitions
of the arguments.[¶](#section-6.4.4-14){.pilcrow}

Upon successful completion of a SELECT or an EXAMINE command (after the
tagged OK response), the current search result variable is reset to the
empty sequence.[¶](#section-6.4.4.1-1){.pilcrow}

A successful SEARCH command with the SAVE result option sets the value
of the search result variable to the list of messages found in the
SEARCH command. For example, if no messages were found, the search
result variable will contain the empty
sequence.[¶](#section-6.4.4.1-2){.pilcrow}

Any of the following SEARCH commands [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} change the
search result variable:[¶](#section-6.4.4.1-3){.pilcrow}

-   [a SEARCH command that caused the server to return the BAD tagged
    response,[¶](#section-6.4.4.1-4.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.4.4.1-4.1}
-   [a SEARCH command with no SAVE result option that caused the server
    to return NO tagged response,
    and[¶](#section-6.4.4.1-4.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.4.4.1-4.2}
-   [a successful SEARCH command with no SAVE result
    option.[¶](#section-6.4.4.1-4.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.4.4.1-4.3}

A SEARCH command with the SAVE result option that caused the server to
return the NO tagged response sets the value of the search result
variable to the empty sequence.[¶](#section-6.4.4.1-5){.pilcrow}

When a message listed in the search result variable is EXPUNGEd, it is
automatically removed from the list. Implementors are reminded that if
the server stores the list as a list of message numbers, it
[MUST]{.bcp14} automatically adjust them when notifying the client about
expunged messages, as described in [Section
7.5.1](#expunge-response){.xref}.[¶](#section-6.4.4.1-6){.pilcrow}

If the server decides to send a new UIDVALIDITY value while the mailbox
is opened, it causes the resetting of the search variable to the empty
sequence.[¶](#section-6.4.4.1-7){.pilcrow}

Note that even if the \"\$\" marker contains the empty sequence of
messages, it must be treated by all commands accepting message sets as
parameters as a valid, but non-matching, list of messages. For example,
the \"FETCH \$\" command would return a tagged OK response and no FETCH
responses. See also Example 5 in [Section
6.4.4.4](#search-save-examples){.xref}.[¶](#section-6.4.4.1-8){.pilcrow}

The SAVE result option doesn\'t change whether the server would return
items corresponding to MIN, MAX, ALL, or COUNT result
options.[¶](#section-6.4.4.1-9){.pilcrow}

When the SAVE result option is combined with the MIN or MAX result
option, and both ALL and COUNT result options are absent, the
corresponding MIN/MAX is returned (if the search result is not empty),
but the \"\$\" marker would contain a single message as returned in the
MIN/MAX return item.[¶](#section-6.4.4.1-10){.pilcrow}

If the SAVE result option is combined with both MIN and MAX result
options, and both ALL and COUNT result options are absent, the \"\$\"
marker would contain zero messages, one message, or two messages as
returned in the MIN/MAX return items.[¶](#section-6.4.4.1-11){.pilcrow}

If the SAVE result option is combined with the ALL and/or COUNT result
option(s), the \"\$\" marker would always contain all messages found by
the SEARCH or UID SEARCH command.[¶](#section-6.4.4.1-12){.pilcrow}

The following table summarizes the additional requirement on ESEARCH
server implementations described in this
section.[¶](#section-6.4.4.1-13){.pilcrow}

  Combination of Result Option   \"\$\" Marker Value
  ------------------------------ ---------------------
  SAVE MIN                       MIN
  SAVE MAX                       MAX
  SAVE MIN MAX                   MIN & MAX
  SAVE \* \[m\]                  all found messages

  : [Table 4](#table-4){.selfRef}

where \'\*\' means \"ALL\" and/or \"COUNT\", and \'\[m\]\' means
optional \"MIN\" and/or \"MAX\"[¶](#section-6.4.4.1-15){.pilcrow}

Implementation note: server implementors should note that \"\$\" can
reference IMAP message sequences or UID sequences, depending on the
context where it is used. For example, the \"\$\" marker can be set as a
result of a SEARCH (SAVE) command and used as a parameter to a UID FETCH
command (which accepts a UID sequence, not a message sequence), or the
\"\$\" marker can be set as a result of a UID SEARCH (SAVE) command and
used as a parameter to a FETCH command (which accepts a message
sequence, not a UID sequence). Server implementations need to
automatically map the \"\$\" marker value to message numbers or UIDs,
depending on the context where the \"\$\" marker is
used.[¶](#section-6.4.4.1-16){.pilcrow}

Use of a SEARCH RETURN (SAVE) command followed by a command using the

The FETCH command retrieves data associated with a message in the
mailbox. The data items to be fetched can be either a single atom or a
parenthesized list.[¶](#section-6.4.5-2){.pilcrow}

Most data items, identified in the formal syntax ([Section
9](#IMAP-ABNF){.xref}) under the msg-att-static rule, are static and
[MUST NOT]{.bcp14} change for any particular message. Other data items,
identified in the formal syntax under the msg-att-dynamic rule,
[MAY]{.bcp14} change either as a result of a STORE command or due to
external events.[¶](#section-6.4.5-3){.pilcrow}

-   [For example, if a client receives an ENVELOPE for a message when it

    The \<partial> argument, if present, requests that a subset of the

    are the same as for a partial FETCH BODY command, with the exception
    that the \<partial> arguments refer to the DECODED section

    Note: client authors are cautioned that this might be an expensive
    operation for some server implementations. Needlessly issuing this
    request could result in degraded performance due to servers having
    to calculate the value every time the request is
    issued.[¶](#section-6.4.5-9.6.2){.pilcrow}

    Note that this data item can only be requested for leaf body parts:

    expression of the entire
    message.[¶](#section-6.4.5-9.10.1){.pilcrow}

    It is possible to fetch a substring of the designated text. This is
    done by appending an open angle bracket (\"\<\"), the octet position
    of the first desired octet, a period, the maximum number of octets
    desired, and a close angle bracket (\"\>\") to the part specifier.
    If the starting octet is beyond the end of the text, an empty string
    is returned.[¶](#section-6.4.5-9.10.2){.pilcrow}

    Any partial fetch that attempts to read beyond the end of the text
    is truncated as appropriate. A partial fetch that starts at octet 0
    is returned as a partial fetch, even if this truncation
    happened.[¶](#section-6.4.5-9.10.3){.pilcrow}

    Note: This means that BODY\[\]\<0.2048> of a 1500-octet message will
    return BODY\[\]\<0> with a literal of size 1500, not
    BODY\[\].[¶](#section-6.4.5-9.10.4){.pilcrow}

    Note: A substring fetch of a HEADER.FIELDS or HEADER.FIELDS.NOT part
    specifier is calculated after subsetting the

##### [6.4.5.1.](#section-6.4.5.1){.section-number .selfRef} [FETCH Section Specification](#name-fetch-section-specification){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-fetch-section-specification}

Several FETCH data items reference \"section\" or \"section-binary\".
The section specification is a set of zero or more part specifiers
delimited by periods. A part specifier is either a part number or one of
the following: HEADER, HEADER.FIELDS, HEADER.FIELDS.NOT, MIME, and TEXT.
(Non-numeric part specifiers have to be the last specifier in a section
specification.) An empty section specification refers to the entire
message, including the header.[¶](#section-6.4.5.1-1){.pilcrow}

Every message has at least one part number. Messages that do not use
MIME, and MIME messages that are not multipart and have no encapsulated
message within them, only have a part
1.[¶](#section-6.4.5.1-2){.pilcrow}

Multipart messages are assigned consecutive part numbers, as they occur
in the message. If a particular part is of type message or multipart,
its parts [MUST]{.bcp14} be indicated by a period followed by the part
number within that nested multipart
part.[¶](#section-6.4.5.1-3){.pilcrow}

A part of type MESSAGE/RFC822 or MESSAGE/GLOBAL also has nested part
numbers, referring to parts of the MESSAGE part\'s
body.[¶](#section-6.4.5.1-4){.pilcrow}

[]{#iref-header-part-specifier-115 .iref}
[]{#iref-headerfields-part-specifier .iref}
[]{#iref-headerfieldsnot-part-specif .iref}
[]{#iref-text-part-specifier-118 .iref} The HEADER, HEADER.FIELDS,
HEADER.FIELDS.NOT, and TEXT part specifiers can be the sole part
specifier or can be prefixed by one or more numeric part specifiers,
provided that the numeric part specifier refers to a part of type
MESSAGE/RFC822 or MESSAGE/GLOBAL. The MIME part specifier [MUST]{.bcp14}
be prefixed by one or more numeric part
specifiers.[¶](#section-6.4.5.1-5){.pilcrow}

The HEADER, HEADER.FIELDS, and HEADER.FIELDS.NOT part specifiers refer
to the \[[RFC5322](#RFC5322){.xref}\] header of the message or of an
encapsulated \[[MIME-IMT](#RFC2046){.xref}\] MESSAGE/RFC822 or
MESSAGE/GLOBAL message. HEADER.FIELDS and HEADER.FIELDS.NOT are followed
by a list of field-names (as defined in \[[RFC5322](#RFC5322){.xref}\])
and return a subset of the header. The subset returned by HEADER.FIELDS
contains only those header fields with a field-name that matches one of
the names in the list; similarly, the subset returned by
HEADER.FIELDS.NOT contains only the header fields with a non-matching
field-name. The field-matching is ASCII-range case insensitive but is
otherwise exact. Subsetting does not exclude the
\[[RFC5322](#RFC5322){.xref}\] delimiting blank line between the header
and the body; the blank line is included in all header fetches, except
in the case of a message that has no body and no blank
line.[¶](#section-6.4.5.1-6){.pilcrow}

[]{#iref-mime-part-specifier-119 .iref} The MIME part specifier refers
to the \[[MIME-IMB](#RFC2045){.xref}\] header for this
part.[¶](#section-6.4.5.1-7){.pilcrow}

The TEXT part specifier refers to the text body of the message, omitting
the \[[RFC5322](#RFC5322){.xref}\]
header.[¶](#section-6.4.5.1-8){.pilcrow}

Here is an example of a complex message with some of its part
specifiers:[¶](#section-6.4.5.1-9){.pilcrow}

The STORE command alters data associated with a message in the mailbox.
Normally, STORE will return the updated value of the data with an
untagged FETCH response. A suffix of \".SILENT\" in the data item name
prevents the untagged FETCH, and the server [SHOULD]{.bcp14} assume that
the client has determined the updated value itself or does not care
about the updated value.[¶](#section-6.4.6-2){.pilcrow}

Note: Regardless of whether or not the \".SILENT\" suffix was used, the
server [SHOULD]{.bcp14} send an untagged FETCH response if a change to a

the status of the flags is determinate without a race

The COPY command copies the specified message(s) to the end of the
specified destination mailbox. The flags and internal date of the
message(s) [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be preserved in the
copy.[¶](#section-6.4.7-2){.pilcrow}

If the destination mailbox does not exist, a server [MUST]{.bcp14}
return an error. It [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} automatically create the mailbox.
Unless it is certain that the destination mailbox can not be created,
the server [MUST]{.bcp14} send the response code \"\[TRYCREATE\]\" as
the prefix of the text of the tagged NO response. This gives a hint to
the client that it can attempt a CREATE command and retry the COPY if
the CREATE is successful.[¶](#section-6.4.7-3){.pilcrow}

If the COPY command is unsuccessful for any reason, server
implementations [MUST]{.bcp14} restore the destination mailbox to its
state before the COPY attempt (other than possibly incrementing
UIDNEXT), i.e., partial copy [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be
done.[¶](#section-6.4.7-4){.pilcrow}

On successful completion of a COPY, the server returns a COPYUID
response code (see [Section 7.1](#server-status-responses){.xref}). Two
exceptions to this requirement are listed
below.[¶](#section-6.4.7-5){.pilcrow}

In the case of a mailbox that has permissions set so that the client can
COPY to the mailbox, but not SELECT or EXAMINE it, the server [MUST
NOT]{.bcp14} send a COPYUID response code as it would disclose
information about the mailbox.[¶](#section-6.4.7-6){.pilcrow}

In the case of a mailbox that has UIDNOTSTICKY status (see [Section

The MOVE command moves the specified message(s) to the end of the
specified destination mailbox. The flags and internal date of the
message(s) [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be preserved.[¶](#section-6.4.8-2){.pilcrow}

This means that a new message is created in the target mailbox with a
new UID, the original message is removed from the source mailbox, and it
appears to the client as a single action. This has the same effect for
each message as this sequence:[¶](#section-6.4.8-3){.pilcrow}

1.  [\[UID\] COPY[¶](#section-6.4.8-4.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.4.8-4.1}

3.  [UID EXPUNGE[¶](#section-6.4.8-4.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.4.8-4.3}

Although the effect of the MOVE is the same as the preceding steps, the
semantics are not identical: the intermediate states produced by those
steps do not occur, and the response codes are different. In particular,
though the COPY and EXPUNGE response codes will be returned, response
codes for a STORE [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be generated, and the \\Deleted
flag [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be set for any
message.[¶](#section-6.4.8-5){.pilcrow}

Unlike the COPY command, MOVE of a set of messages might fail partway
through the set. Regardless of whether the command is successful in
moving the entire set, each individual message [MUST]{.bcp14} be either
moved or unaffected. The server [MUST]{.bcp14} leave each message in a
state where it is in at least one of the source or target mailboxes (no
message can be lost or orphaned). The server [SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} leave
any message in both mailboxes (it would be bad for a partial failure to
result in a bunch of duplicate messages). This is true even if the
server returns a tagged NO response to the
command.[¶](#section-6.4.8-6){.pilcrow}

If the destination mailbox does not exist, a server [MUST]{.bcp14}
return an error. It [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} automatically create the mailbox.
Unless it is certain that the destination mailbox cannot be created, the
server [MUST]{.bcp14} send the response code \"\[TRYCREATE\]\" as the
prefix of the text of the tagged NO response. This gives a hint to the
client that it can attempt a CREATE command and retry the MOVE if the
CREATE is successful.[¶](#section-6.4.8-7){.pilcrow}

Because of the similarity of MOVE to COPY, extensions that affect COPY
affect MOVE in the same way. Response codes listed in [Section
7.1](#server-status-responses){.xref}, as well as those defined by
extensions, are sent as indicated for
COPY.[¶](#section-6.4.8-8){.pilcrow}

Servers send COPYUID in response to a MOVE or a UID MOVE (see [Section
6.4.9](#uid-commands){.xref}) command. For additional information about
COPYUID, see [Section 7.1](#server-status-responses){.xref}. Note that
there are several exceptions listed in [Section
6.4.7](#copy-command){.xref} that allow servers not to return
COPYUID.[¶](#section-6.4.8-9){.pilcrow}

Servers are also [REQUIRED]{.bcp14} to send the COPYUID response code in
an untagged OK before sending EXPUNGE or similar responses. (Sending
COPYUID in the tagged OK, as described in [Section
6.4.7](#copy-command){.xref}, means that clients first receive an
EXPUNGE for a message and afterwards COPYUID for the same message. It
can be unnecessarily difficult to process that sequence
usefully.)[¶](#section-6.4.8-10){.pilcrow}

An example:[¶](#section-6.4.8-11){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-6.4.8-12}
``` sourcecode
  C: a UID MOVE 42:69 foo
  S: * OK [COPYUID 432432 42:69 1202:1229]
  S: * 22 EXPUNGE
  ...More EXPUNGE responses from the server...
  S: a OK Done
```

[¶](#section-6.4.8-12){.pilcrow}
:::

Note that the server may send unrelated EXPUNGE responses as well, if
any happen to have been expunged at the same time; this is normal IMAP
operation.[¶](#section-6.4.8-13){.pilcrow}

Note that moving a message to the currently selected mailbox (that is,
where the source and target mailboxes are the same) is allowed when
copying the message to the currently selected mailbox is
allowed.[¶](#section-6.4.8-14){.pilcrow}

The server may send EXPUNGE responses before the tagged response, so the
client cannot safely send more commands with message sequence number
arguments while the server is processing
MOVE.[¶](#section-6.4.8-15){.pilcrow}

MOVE and UID MOVE can be pipelined with other commands, but care has to
be taken. Both commands modify sequence numbers and also allow unrelated
EXPUNGE responses. The renumbering of other messages in the source
mailbox following any EXPUNGE response can be surprising and makes it
unsafe to pipeline any command that relies on message sequence numbers
after a MOVE or UID MOVE. Similarly, MOVE cannot be pipelined with a
command that might cause message renumbering. See [Section
5.5](#pipelining){.xref} for more information about ambiguities as well
as handling requirements for both clients and
servers.[¶](#section-6.4.8-16){.pilcrow}

The UID command has three forms. In the first form, it takes as its
arguments a COPY, MOVE, FETCH, or STORE command with arguments
appropriate for the associated command. However, the numbers in the
sequence-set argument are unique identifiers instead of message sequence
numbers. Sequence-set ranges are permitted, but there is no guarantee
that unique identifiers will be
contiguous.[¶](#section-6.4.9-2){.pilcrow}

A non-existent unique identifier is ignored without any error message
generated. Thus, it is possible for a UID FETCH command to return an OK
without any data or a UID COPY, UID MOVE, or UID STORE to return an OK
without performing any operations.[¶](#section-6.4.9-3){.pilcrow}

In the second form, the UID command takes an EXPUNGE command with an
extra parameter that specifies a sequence set of UIDs to operate on. The
UID EXPUNGE command permanently removes all messages that have both the
\\Deleted flag set and a UID that is included in the specified sequence
set from the currently selected mailbox. If a message either does not
have the \\Deleted flag set or has a UID that is not included in the
specified sequence set, it is not
affected.[¶](#section-6.4.9-4){.pilcrow}

UID EXPUNGE is particularly useful for disconnected use clients. By
using UID EXPUNGE instead of EXPUNGE when resynchronizing with the
server, the client can ensure that it does not inadvertently remove any
messages that have been marked as \\Deleted by other clients between the
time that the client was last connected and the time the client
resynchronizes.[¶](#section-6.4.9-5){.pilcrow}

Example:[¶](#section-6.4.9-6){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-6.4.9-7}
``` sourcecode
  C: A003 UID EXPUNGE 3000:3002
  S: * 3 EXPUNGE
  S: * 3 EXPUNGE
  S: * 3 EXPUNGE
  S: A003 OK UID EXPUNGE completed
```

[¶](#section-6.4.9-7){.pilcrow}
:::

In the third form, the UID command takes a SEARCH command with SEARCH
command arguments. The interpretation of the arguments is the same as
with SEARCH; however, the numbers returned in an ESEARCH response for a
UID SEARCH command are unique identifiers instead of message sequence
numbers. Also, the corresponding ESEARCH response [MUST]{.bcp14} include
the UID indicator. For example, the command UID SEARCH 1:100 UID 443:557
returns the unique identifiers corresponding to the intersection of two
sequence sets, the message sequence number range 1:100, and the UID
range 443:557.[¶](#section-6.4.9-8){.pilcrow}

Note: in the above example, the UID range 443:557 appears. The same
comment about a non-existent unique identifier being ignored without any
error message also applies here. Hence, even if neither UID 443 or 557
exist, this range is valid and would include an existing UID
495.[¶](#section-6.4.9-9){.pilcrow}

Also note that a UID range of 559:\* always includes the UID of the last
message in the mailbox, even if 559 is higher than any assigned UID
value. This is because the contents of a range are independent of the
order of the range endpoints. Thus, any UID range with \* as one of the
endpoints indicates at least one message (the message with the highest
numbered UID), unless the mailbox is
empty.[¶](#section-6.4.9-10){.pilcrow}

The number after the \"\*\" in an untagged FETCH or EXPUNGE response is
always a message sequence number, not a unique identifier, even for a
UID command response. However, server implementations [MUST]{.bcp14}
implicitly include the UID message data item as part of any FETCH
response caused by a UID command, regardless of whether a UID was
specified as a message data item to the
FETCH.[¶](#section-6.4.9-11){.pilcrow}

Note: The rule about including the UID message data item as part of a
FETCH response primarily applies to the UID FETCH and UID STORE
commands, including a UID FETCH command that does not include UID as a
message data item. Although it is unlikely that the other UID commands
will cause an untagged FETCH, this rule applies to these commands as
well.[¶](#section-6.4.9-12){.pilcrow}

Example:[¶](#section-6.4.9-13){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-7 .section}
## [7.](#section-7){.section-number .selfRef} [Server Responses](#name-server-responses){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-server-responses}

Server responses are in three forms: status responses, server data, and
command continuation requests. The information contained in a server
response, identified by \"Contents:\" in the response descriptions
below, is described by function, not by syntax. The precise syntax of
server responses is described in \"Formal Syntax\" ([Section
9](#IMAP-ABNF){.xref}).[¶](#section-7-1){.pilcrow}

The client [MUST]{.bcp14} be prepared to accept any response at all
times.[¶](#section-7-2){.pilcrow}

Status responses can be tagged or untagged. Tagged status responses
indicate the completion result (OK, NO, or BAD status) of a client
command and have a tag matching the command.[¶](#section-7-3){.pilcrow}

Some status responses, and all server data, are untagged. An untagged
response is indicated by the token \"\*\" instead of a tag. Untagged
status responses indicate server greeting or server status that does not
indicate the completion of a command (for example, an impending system
shutdown alert). For historical reasons, untagged server data responses
are also called \"unsolicited data\", although strictly speaking, only
unilateral server data is truly
\"unsolicited\".[¶](#section-7-4){.pilcrow}

Certain server data [MUST]{.bcp14} be remembered by the client when it
is received; this is noted in the description of that data. Such data
conveys critical information that affects the interpretation of all
subsequent commands and responses (e.g., updates reflecting the creation
or destruction of messages).[¶](#section-7-5){.pilcrow}

Other server data [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be remembered for later reference; if
the client does not need to remember the data, or if remembering the
data has no obvious purpose (e.g., a SEARCH response when no SEARCH
command is in progress), the data can be
ignored.[¶](#section-7-6){.pilcrow}

An example of unilateral untagged server data occurs when the IMAP
connection is in the selected state. In the selected state, the server
checks the mailbox for new messages as part of command execution.
Normally, this is part of the execution of every command; hence, a NOOP
command suffices to check for new messages. If new messages are found,
the server sends an untagged EXISTS response reflecting the new size of
the mailbox. Server implementations that offer multiple simultaneous
access to the same mailbox [SHOULD]{.bcp14} also send appropriate
unilateral untagged FETCH and EXPUNGE responses if another agent changes
the state of any message flags or expunges any
messages.[¶](#section-7-7){.pilcrow}

Command continuation request responses use the token \"+\" instead of a
tag. These responses are sent by the server to indicate acceptance of an
incomplete client command and readiness for the remainder of the
command.[¶](#section-7-8){.pilcrow}

### [7.1.](#section-7.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Server Responses - Generic Status Responses](#name-server-responses-generic-st){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-server-responses-generic-st}

Status responses are OK, NO, BAD, PREAUTH, and BYE. OK, NO, and BAD can
be tagged or untagged. PREAUTH and BYE are always
untagged.[¶](#section-7.1-1){.pilcrow}

Status responses [MAY]{.bcp14} include an [OPTIONAL]{.bcp14} \"response
code\". A response code consists of data inside square brackets in the
form of an atom, possibly followed by a space and arguments. The
response code contains additional information or status codes for client
software beyond the OK/NO/BAD condition and are defined when there is a
specific action that a client can take based upon the additional
information.[¶](#section-7.1-2){.pilcrow}

    If the server also supports the \[[MULTIAPPEND](#RFC3502){.xref}\]
    extension, and if multiple messages were appended in the APPEND

    Note: the UID set form of the APPENDUID response code [MUST
    NOT]{.bcp14} be used if only a single message was appended. In

    \[[MULTIAPPEND](#RFC3502){.xref}\] expects only a single UID and not
    a UID set.[¶](#section-7.1-4.6.3){.pilcrow}

1.  [as part of a normal logout sequence. The server will close the

The difference between a BYE that occurs as part of a normal LOGOUT

The CAPABILITY response occurs as a result of a CAPABILITY command. The
capability listing contains a space-separated listing of capability
names that the server supports. The capability listing [MUST]{.bcp14}
include the atom \"IMAP4rev2\", but note that it doesn\'t have to be the
first capability listed. The order of capability names has no
significance.[¶](#section-7.2.2-2){.pilcrow}

Client and server implementations [MUST]{.bcp14} implement the
capabilities \"AUTH=PLAIN\" (described in \[[PLAIN](#RFC4616){.xref}\]),
and [MUST]{.bcp14} implement \"STARTTLS\" and \"LOGINDISABLED\" on the
cleartext port. See the Security Considerations ([Section
11](#sec-cons){.xref}) for important information related to these
capabilities.[¶](#section-7.2.2-3){.pilcrow}

A capability name that begins with \"AUTH=\" indicates that the server
supports that particular authentication mechanism
\[[SASL](#RFC4422){.xref}\].[¶](#section-7.2.2-4){.pilcrow}

The LOGINDISABLED capability indicates that the LOGIN command is
disabled, and that the server will respond with a tagged NO response to
any attempt to use the LOGIN command even if the user name and password
are valid (their validity will not be checked). An IMAP client [MUST
NOT]{.bcp14} issue the LOGIN command if the server advertises the
LOGINDISABLED capability.[¶](#section-7.2.2-5){.pilcrow}

Other capability names indicate that the server supports an extension,
revision, or amendment to the IMAP4rev2 protocol. If IMAP4rev1
capability is not advertised, server responses [MUST]{.bcp14} conform to
this document until the client issues a command that uses an additional
capability. If both IMAP4rev1 and IMAP4rev2 capabilities are advertised,
server responses [MUST]{.bcp14} conform to
\[[RFC3501](#RFC3501){.xref}\] until the client issues a command that
uses an additional capability. (For example, the client can issue ENABLE
IMAP4rev2 to enable IMAP4rev2-specific
behavior.)[¶](#section-7.2.2-6){.pilcrow}

Capability names [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be registered with IANA using the RFC
Required policy \[[RFC8126](#RFC8126){.xref}\]. A server [SHOULD
NOT]{.bcp14} offer unregistered capability
names.[¶](#section-7.2.2-7){.pilcrow}

Client implementations [SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} require any capability name
other than \"IMAP4rev2\", and possibly \"STARTTLS\" and
\"LOGINDISABLED\" (on a cleartext port). Client implementations
[MUST]{.bcp14} ignore any unknown capability
names.[¶](#section-7.2.2-8){.pilcrow}

A server [MAY]{.bcp14} send capabilities automatically, by using the
CAPABILITY response code in the initial PREAUTH or OK responses and by
sending an updated CAPABILITY response code in the tagged OK response as
part of a successful authentication. It is unnecessary for a client to
send a separate CAPABILITY command if it recognizes these automatic
capabilities and there was no change to the TLS and/or authentication
state since they were received.[¶](#section-7.2.2-9){.pilcrow}

The list of capabilities returned by a server [MAY]{.bcp14} change
during the connection. In particular, it is quite common for the server
to change the list of capabilities after successful TLS negotiation
(STARTTLS command) and/or after successful authentication (AUTHENTICATE
or LOGIN commands).[¶](#section-7.2.2-10){.pilcrow}

The LIST response occurs as a result of a LIST command. It returns a
single name that matches the LIST specification. There can be multiple
LIST responses for a single LIST command.[¶](#section-7.3.1-2){.pilcrow}

The following base mailbox name attributes are
defined:[¶](#section-7.3.1-3){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

\\NonExistent

:   []{#iref-nonexistent-mailbox-name-at .iref} The \"\\NonExistent\"
    attribute indicates that a mailbox name does not refer to an
    existing mailbox. Note that this attribute is not meaningful by
    itself, as mailbox names that match the canonical LIST pattern but
    don\'t exist must not be returned unless one of the two conditions
    listed below is also satisfied:[¶](#section-7.3.1-4.2.1){.pilcrow}

    1.  [The mailbox name also satisfies the selection criteria (for
        example, it is subscribed and the \"SUBSCRIBED\" selection
        option has been
        specified).[¶](#section-7.3.1-4.2.2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-7.3.1-4.2.2.1}
    2.  [\"RECURSIVEMATCH\" has been specified, and the mailbox name has
        at least one descendant mailbox name that does not match the
        LIST pattern and does match the selection
        criteria.[¶](#section-7.3.1-4.2.2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-7.3.1-4.2.2.2}

    In practice, this means that the \"\\NonExistent\" attribute is
    usually returned with one or more of \"\\Subscribed\", \"\\Remote\",
    \"\\HasChildren\", or the CHILDINFO extended data
    item.[¶](#section-7.3.1-4.2.3){.pilcrow}

    The \"\\NonExistent\" attribute implies
    \"\\NoSelect\".[¶](#section-7.3.1-4.2.4){.pilcrow}

:   

\\Noinferiors
:   []{#iref-noinferiors-mailbox-name-at .iref} It is not possible for
    any child levels of hierarchy to exist under this name; no child
    levels exist now and none can be created in the
    future.[¶](#section-7.3.1-4.4){.pilcrow}
:   

\\Noselect
:   []{#iref-noselect-mailbox-name-attri .iref} It is not possible to
    use this name as a selectable
    mailbox.[¶](#section-7.3.1-4.6){.pilcrow}
:   

\\HasChildren
:   []{#iref-haschildren-mailbox-name-at .iref} The presence of this
    attribute indicates that the mailbox has child mailboxes. A server
    [SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} set this attribute if there are child mailboxes
    and the user does not have permission to access any of them. In this
    case, \\HasNoChildren [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be used. In many cases,
    however, a server may not be able to efficiently compute whether a
    user has access to any child mailboxes. Note that even though the
    \\HasChildren attribute for a mailbox must be correct at the time of
    processing the mailbox, a client must be prepared to deal with a
    situation when a mailbox is marked with the \\HasChildren attribute,
    but no child mailbox appears in the response to the LIST command.
    This might happen, for example, due to child mailboxes being deleted
    or made inaccessible to the user (using access control) by another
    client before the server is able to list
    them.[¶](#section-7.3.1-4.8){.pilcrow}
:   

\\HasNoChildren
:   []{#iref-hasnochildren-mailbox-name- .iref} The presence of this
    attribute indicates that the mailbox has NO child mailboxes that are
    accessible to the currently authenticated
    user.[¶](#section-7.3.1-4.10){.pilcrow}
:   

\\Marked
:   []{#iref-marked-mailbox-name-attribu .iref} The mailbox has been
    marked \"interesting\" by the server; the mailbox probably contains
    messages that have been added since the last time the mailbox was
    selected.[¶](#section-7.3.1-4.12){.pilcrow}
:   

\\Unmarked
:   []{#iref-unmarked-mailbox-name-attri .iref} The mailbox does not
    contain any additional messages since the last time the mailbox was
    selected.[¶](#section-7.3.1-4.14){.pilcrow}
:   

\\Subscribed
:   []{#iref-subscribed-mailbox-name-att .iref} The mailbox name was
    subscribed to using the SUBSCRIBE
    command.[¶](#section-7.3.1-4.16){.pilcrow}
:   

\\Remote
:   []{#iref-remote-mailbox-name-attribu .iref} The mailbox is a remote
    mailbox.[¶](#section-7.3.1-4.18){.pilcrow}
:   

It is an error for the server to return both a \\HasChildren and a
\\HasNoChildren attribute in the same LIST response. A client that
encounters a LIST response with both \\HasChildren and \\HasNoChildren
attributes present should act as if both are absent in the LIST
response.[¶](#section-7.3.1-5){.pilcrow}

Note: the \\HasNoChildren attribute should not be confused with the
\\NoInferiors attribute, which indicates that no child mailboxes exist
now and none can be created in the
future.[¶](#section-7.3.1-6){.pilcrow}

If it is not feasible for the server to determine whether or not the
mailbox is \"interesting\", the server [SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} send either
\\Marked or \\Unmarked. The server [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} send more than one
of \\Marked, \\Unmarked, and \\Noselect for a single mailbox, and it
[MAY]{.bcp14} send none of these.[¶](#section-7.3.1-7){.pilcrow}

In addition to the base mailbox name attributes defined above, an IMAP
server [MAY]{.bcp14} also include any or all of the following attributes
that denote \"role\" (or \"special-use\") of a mailbox. These attributes
are included along with base attributes defined above. A given mailbox
may have none, one, or more than one of these attributes. In some cases,
a special use is advice to a client about what to put in that mailbox.
In other cases, it\'s advice to a client about what to expect to find
there.[¶](#section-7.3.1-8){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

\\All
:   []{#iref-all-mailbox-name-attribute- .iref} This mailbox presents
    all messages in the user\'s message store. Implementations
    [MAY]{.bcp14} omit some messages, such as, perhaps, those in \\Trash
    and \\Junk. When this special use is supported, it is almost certain
    to represent a virtual mailbox.[¶](#section-7.3.1-9.2){.pilcrow}
:   

\\Archive
:   []{#iref-archive-mailbox-name-attrib .iref} This mailbox is used to
    archive messages. The meaning of an \"archival\" mailbox is server
    dependent; typically, it will be used to get messages out of the
    inbox, or otherwise keep them out of the user\'s way, while still
    making them accessible.[¶](#section-7.3.1-9.4){.pilcrow}
:   

\\Drafts
:   []{#iref-drafts-mailbox-name-attribu .iref} This mailbox is used to
    hold draft messages \-- typically, messages that are being composed
    but have not yet been sent. In some server implementations, this
    might be a virtual mailbox, containing messages from other mailboxes
    that are marked with the \"\\Draft\" message flag. Alternatively,
    this might just be advice that a client put drafts
    here.[¶](#section-7.3.1-9.6){.pilcrow}
:   

\\Flagged
:   []{#iref-flagged-mailbox-name-attrib .iref} This mailbox presents
    all messages marked in some way as \"important\". When this special
    use is supported, it is likely to represent a virtual mailbox
    collecting messages (from other mailboxes) that are marked with the
    \"\\Flagged\" message flag.[¶](#section-7.3.1-9.8){.pilcrow}
:   

\\Junk
:   []{#iref-junk-mailbox-name-attribute .iref} This mailbox is where
    messages deemed to be junk mail are held. Some server
    implementations might put messages here automatically.
    Alternatively, this might just be advice to a client-side spam
    filter.[¶](#section-7.3.1-9.10){.pilcrow}
:   

\\Sent
:   []{#iref-sent-mailbox-name-attribute .iref} This mailbox is used to
    hold copies of messages that have been sent. Some server
    implementations might put messages here automatically.
    Alternatively, this might just be advice that a client save sent
    messages here.[¶](#section-7.3.1-9.12){.pilcrow}
:   

\\Trash
:   []{#iref-trash-mailbox-name-attribut .iref} This mailbox is used to
    hold messages that have been deleted or marked for deletion. In some
    server implementations, this might be a virtual mailbox, containing
    messages from other mailboxes that are marked with the \"\\Deleted\"
    message flag. Alternatively, this might just be advice that a client
    that chooses not to use the IMAP \"\\Deleted\" model should use as
    its trash location. In server implementations that strictly expect
    the IMAP \"\\Deleted\" model, this special use is likely not to be
    supported.[¶](#section-7.3.1-9.14){.pilcrow}
:   

All special-use attributes are [OPTIONAL]{.bcp14}, and any given server
or message store may support any combination of the attributes, or none
at all. In most cases, there will likely be at most one mailbox with a
given attribute for a given user, but in some server or message store
implementations, it might be possible for multiple mailboxes to have the
same special-use attribute.[¶](#section-7.3.1-10){.pilcrow}

Special-use attributes are likely to be user specific. User Adam might
share his \\Sent mailbox with user Barb, but that mailbox is unlikely to
also serve as Barb\'s \\Sent mailbox.[¶](#section-7.3.1-11){.pilcrow}

Other mailbox name attributes can be found in the \"IMAP Mailbox Name
Attributes\" registry
\[[IMAP-MAILBOX-NAME-ATTRS-REG](#IMAP-MAILBOX-NAME-ATTRS-REG){.xref}\].[¶](#section-7.3.1-12){.pilcrow}

The hierarchy delimiter is a character used to delimit levels of
hierarchy in a mailbox name. A client can use it to create child
mailboxes and to search higher or lower levels of naming hierarchy. All
children of a top-level hierarchy node [MUST]{.bcp14} use the same
separator character. A NIL hierarchy delimiter means that no hierarchy
exists; the name is a \"flat\" name.[¶](#section-7.3.1-13){.pilcrow}

The name represents an unambiguous left-to-right hierarchy and
[MUST]{.bcp14} be valid for use as a reference in LIST command. Unless
\\Noselect or \\NonExistent is indicated, the name [MUST]{.bcp14} also
be valid as an argument for commands, such as SELECT, that accept
mailbox names.[¶](#section-7.3.1-14){.pilcrow}

The name might be followed by an [OPTIONAL]{.bcp14} series of extended
fields, a parenthesized list of tagged data (also referred to as an
\"extended data item\"). The first element of an extended field is a
string, which identifies the type of data.
\[[RFC5258](#RFC5258){.xref}\] specifies requirements on string
registration (which are called \"tags\"; such tags are not to be
confused with IMAP command tags); in particular, it states that \"Tags
[MUST]{.bcp14} be registered with IANA\". This document doesn\'t change
that. See [Section
9.5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5258#section-9.5){.relref} of
\[[RFC5258](#RFC5258){.xref}\] for the registration template. The server
[MAY]{.bcp14} return data in the extended fields that was not directly
solicited by the client in the corresponding LIST command. For example,
the client can enable extra extended fields by using another IMAP
extension that makes use of the extended LIST responses. The client
[MUST]{.bcp14} ignore all extended fields it doesn\'t
recognize.[¶](#section-7.3.1-15){.pilcrow}

The EXPUNGE response reports that the specified message sequence number
has been permanently removed from the mailbox. The message sequence
number for each successive message in the mailbox is immediately
decremented by 1, and this decrement is reflected in message sequence
numbers in subsequent responses (including other untagged EXPUNGE
responses).[¶](#section-7.5.1-2){.pilcrow}

The EXPUNGE response also decrements the number of messages in the
mailbox; it is not necessary to send an EXISTS response with the new
value.[¶](#section-7.5.1-3){.pilcrow}

As a result of the immediate decrement rule, message sequence numbers
that appear in a set of successive EXPUNGE responses depend upon whether
the messages are removed starting from lower numbers to higher numbers,
or from higher numbers to lower numbers. For example, if the last 5
messages in a 9-message mailbox are expunged, a \"lower to higher\"
server will send five untagged EXPUNGE responses for message sequence
number 5, whereas a \"higher to lower\" server will send successive
untagged EXPUNGE responses for message sequence numbers 9, 8, 7, 6, and
5.[¶](#section-7.5.1-4){.pilcrow}

An EXPUNGE response [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be sent when no command is in
progress, nor while responding to a FETCH, STORE, or SEARCH command.
This rule is necessary to prevent a loss of synchronization of message
sequence numbers between client and server. A command is not \"in
progress\" until the complete command has been received; in particular,
a command is not \"in progress\" during the negotiation of command
continuation.[¶](#section-7.5.1-5){.pilcrow}

response occurs as the result of a FETCH or STORE command, as well as by
a unilateral server decision (e.g., flag
updates).[¶](#section-7.5.2-2){.pilcrow}

The current data items are:[¶](#section-7.5.2-3){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

BINARY\[\<section-binary>\]\<\<number>\>

:   []{#iref-binarysection-binarynumber- .iref} An \<nstring> or
    \<literal8> expressing the content of the specified section after
    removing any encoding specified in the corresponding
    Content-Transfer-Encoding header field. If \<number> is present, it
    refers to the offset within the DECODED section
    data.[¶](#section-7.5.2-4.2.1){.pilcrow}

    If the domain of the decoded data is \"8bit\" and the data does not
    contain the NUL octet, the server [SHOULD]{.bcp14} return the data
    in a \<string> instead of a \<literal8>; this allows the client to
    determine if the \"8bit\" data contains the NUL octet without having
    to explicitly scan the data stream for
    NULs.[¶](#section-7.5.2-4.2.2){.pilcrow}

    Messaging clients and servers have been notoriously lax in their
    adherence to the Internet CRLF convention for terminating lines of
    textual data (text/\* media types) in Internet protocols. When
    sending data in a BINARY\[\...\] FETCH data item, servers
    [MUST]{.bcp14} ensure that textual line-oriented sections are always
    transmitted using the IMAP CRLF line termination syntax, regardless
    of the underlying storage representation of the data on the
    server.[¶](#section-7.5.2-4.2.3){.pilcrow}

    If the server does not know how to decode the section\'s
    Content-Transfer-Encoding, it [MUST]{.bcp14} fail the request and
    issue a \"NO\" response that contains the \"UNKNOWN-CTE\" response
    code.[¶](#section-7.5.2-4.2.4){.pilcrow}

:   

BINARY.SIZE\[\<section-binary>\]

:   []{#iref-binarysizesection-binary-fet .iref} The size of the section
    after removing any encoding specified in the corresponding
    Content-Transfer-Encoding header field. The value returned
    [MUST]{.bcp14} match the size of the \<nstring> or \<literal8> that
    will be returned by the corresponding FETCH BINARY
    request.[¶](#section-7.5.2-4.4.1){.pilcrow}

    If the server does not know how to decode the section\'s
    Content-Transfer-Encoding, it [MUST]{.bcp14} fail the request and
    issue a \"NO\" response that contains the \"UNKNOWN-CTE\" response
    code.[¶](#section-7.5.2-4.4.2){.pilcrow}

:   

BODY
:   []{#iref-body-fetch-result-198 .iref} A form of BODYSTRUCTURE
    without extension data.[¶](#section-7.5.2-4.6){.pilcrow}
:   

BODY\[\<section>\]\<\<origin octet>\>

:   []{#iref-bodysectionorigin-octet-fet .iref} A string expressing the
    body contents of the specified section. The string [SHOULD]{.bcp14}
    be interpreted by the client according to the content transfer
    encoding, body type, and subtype.[¶](#section-7.5.2-4.8.1){.pilcrow}

    If the origin octet is specified, this string is a substring of the
    entire body contents, starting at that origin octet. This means that
    BODY\[\]\<0> [MAY]{.bcp14} be truncated, but BODY\[\] is NEVER
    truncated.[¶](#section-7.5.2-4.8.2){.pilcrow}

    Note: The origin octet facility [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be used by a
    server in a FETCH response unless the client specifically requested
    it by means of a FETCH of a BODY\[\<section>\]\<\<partial>\> data
    item.[¶](#section-7.5.2-4.8.3){.pilcrow}

    8-bit textual data is permitted if a \[[CHARSET](#RFC2978){.xref}\]
    identifier is part of the body parameter parenthesized list for this
    section. Note that headers (part specifiers HEADER or MIME, or the
    header portion of a MESSAGE/RFC822 or MESSAGE/GLOBAL part)
    [MAY]{.bcp14} be in UTF-8. Note also that the
    \[[RFC5322](#RFC5322){.xref}\] delimiting blank line between the
    header and the body is not affected by header-line subsetting; the
    blank line is always included as part of the header data, except in
    the case of a message that has no body and no blank
    line.[¶](#section-7.5.2-4.8.4){.pilcrow}

    Non-textual data such as binary data [MUST]{.bcp14} be transfer
    encoded into a textual form, such as base64, prior to being sent to
    the client. To derive the original binary data, the client
    [MUST]{.bcp14} decode the transfer-encoded
    string.[¶](#section-7.5.2-4.8.5){.pilcrow}

:   

BODYSTRUCTURE

:   []{#iref-bodystructure-fetch-result- .iref} A parenthesized list
    that describes the \[[MIME-IMB](#RFC2045){.xref}\] body structure of
    a message. This is computed by the server by parsing the
    \[[MIME-IMB](#RFC2045){.xref}\] header fields, defaulting various
    fields as necessary.[¶](#section-7.5.2-4.10.1){.pilcrow}

    For example, a simple text message of 48 lines and 2279 octets can
    have a body structure of:[¶](#section-7.5.2-4.10.2){.pilcrow}

    ::: {#section-7.5.2-4.10.3 .artwork .art-text .alignLeft}
           ("TEXT" "PLAIN" ("CHARSET" "US-ASCII") NIL NIL "7BIT" 2279 48)

    [¶](#section-7.5.2-4.10.3){.pilcrow}
    :::

    Multiple parts are indicated by parenthesis nesting. Instead of a
    body type as the first element of the parenthesized list, there is a
    sequence of one or more nested body structures. The second element
    of the parenthesized list is the multipart subtype (mixed, digest,
    parallel, alternative, etc.).[¶](#section-7.5.2-4.10.4){.pilcrow}

    For example, a two-part message consisting of a text and a
    base64-encoded text attachment can have a body structure
    of:[¶](#section-7.5.2-4.10.5){.pilcrow}

    ::: {#section-7.5.2-4.10.6 .artwork .art-text .alignLeft}
           (("TEXT" "PLAIN" ("CHARSET" "US-ASCII") NIL NIL "7BIT" 1152 23)

    [¶](#section-7.5.2-4.10.6){.pilcrow}
    :::

    Extension data follows the multipart subtype. Extension data is
    never returned with the BODY fetch but can be returned with a
    BODYSTRUCTURE fetch. Extension data, if present, [MUST]{.bcp14} be
    in the defined order. The extension data of a multipart body part
    are in the following order:[¶](#section-7.5.2-4.10.7){.pilcrow}

:   

body parameter parenthesized list
:   A parenthesized list of attribute/value pairs (e.g., (\"foo\"
    \"bar\" \"baz\" \"rag\") where \"bar\" is the value of \"foo\", and
    \"rag\" is the value of \"baz\") as defined in
    \[[MIME-IMB](#RFC2045){.xref}\]. Servers [SHOULD]{.bcp14} decode
    parameter-value continuations and parameter-value character sets as
    described in \[[RFC2231](#RFC2231){.xref}\], for example, if the
    message contains parameters \"baz\*0\", \"baz\*1\", and \"baz\*2\",
    the server should decode them per \[[RFC2231](#RFC2231){.xref}\],
    concatenate, and return the resulting value as a parameter \"baz\".
    Similarly, if the message contains parameters \"foo\*0\*\" and
    \"foo\*1\*\", the server should decode them per
    \[[RFC2231](#RFC2231){.xref}\], convert to UTF-8, concatenate, and
    return the resulting value as a parameter
    \"foo\*\".[¶](#section-7.5.2-4.12){.pilcrow}
:   

body disposition
:   A parenthesized list, consisting of a disposition type string,
    followed by a parenthesized list of disposition attribute/value
    pairs as defined in \[[DISPOSITION](#RFC2183){.xref}\]. Servers
    [SHOULD]{.bcp14} decode parameter-value continuations as described
    in \[[RFC2231](#RFC2231){.xref}\].[¶](#section-7.5.2-4.14){.pilcrow}

    \[[LOCATION](#RFC2557){.xref}\].[¶](#section-7.5.2-4.18.1){.pilcrow}

    Any following extension data are not yet defined in this version of
    the protocol. Such extension data can consist of zero or more NILs,
    strings, numbers, or potentially nested parenthesized lists of such
    data. Client implementations that do a BODYSTRUCTURE fetch
    [MUST]{.bcp14} be prepared to accept such extension data. Server
    implementations [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} send such extension data until it
    has been defined by a revision of this
    protocol.[¶](#section-7.5.2-4.18.2){.pilcrow}

    The basic fields of a non-multipart body part are in the following
    order:[¶](#section-7.5.2-4.18.3){.pilcrow}

:   

body type
:   A string giving the content media-type name as defined in

:   

body size

:   A number giving the size of the body in octets. Note that this size
    is the size in its transfer encoding and not the resulting size
    after any decoding.[¶](#section-7.5.2-4.32.1){.pilcrow}

    A body type of type MESSAGE and subtype RFC822 contains, immediately
    after the basic fields, the envelope structure, body structure, and
    size in text lines of the encapsulated
    message.[¶](#section-7.5.2-4.32.2){.pilcrow}

    A body type of type TEXT contains, immediately after the basic
    fields, the size of the body in text lines. Note that this size is
    the size in its content transfer encoding and not the resulting size
    after any decoding.[¶](#section-7.5.2-4.32.3){.pilcrow}

    Extension data follows the basic fields and the type-specific fields
    listed above. Extension data is never returned with the BODY fetch
    but can be returned with a BODYSTRUCTURE fetch. Extension data, if
    present, [MUST]{.bcp14} be in the defined
    order.[¶](#section-7.5.2-4.32.4){.pilcrow}

    The extension data of a non-multipart body part are in the following
    order:[¶](#section-7.5.2-4.32.5){.pilcrow}

    Any following extension data are not yet defined in this version of
    the protocol and would be as described above under multipart
    extension data.[¶](#section-7.5.2-4.40.2){.pilcrow}

:   

ENVELOPE

:   []{#iref-envelope-fetch-result-201 .iref} A parenthesized list that
    describes the envelope structure of a message. This is computed by
    the server by parsing the \[[RFC5322](#RFC5322){.xref}\] header into
    the component parts, defaulting various fields as
    necessary.[¶](#section-7.5.2-4.42.1){.pilcrow}

    The fields of the envelope structure are in the following order:
    date, subject, from, sender, reply-to, to, cc, bcc, in-reply-to, and
    message-id. The date, subject, in-reply-to, and message-id fields
    are strings. The from, sender, reply-to, to, cc, and bcc fields are
    parenthesized lists of address
    structures.[¶](#section-7.5.2-4.42.2){.pilcrow}

    An address structure is a parenthesized list that describes an
    electronic mail address. The fields of an address structure are in
    the following order: display name, \[[SMTP](#RFC5321){.xref}\]
    at-domain-list (source route and obs-route ABNF production from
    \[[RFC5322](#RFC5322){.xref}\]), mailbox name (local-part ABNF
    production from \[[RFC5322](#RFC5322){.xref}\]), and
    hostname.[¶](#section-7.5.2-4.42.3){.pilcrow}

    \[[RFC5322](#RFC5322){.xref}\] group syntax is indicated by a
    special form of address structure in which the hostname field is
    NIL. If the mailbox name field is also NIL, this is an end-of-group
    marker (semicolon in RFC 822 syntax). If the mailbox name field is
    non-NIL, this is the start of a group marker, and the mailbox name
    field holds the group name
    phrase.[¶](#section-7.5.2-4.42.4){.pilcrow}

    If the Date, Subject, In-Reply-To, and Message-ID header fields are
    absent in the \[[RFC5322](#RFC5322){.xref}\] header, the
    corresponding member of the envelope is NIL; if these header fields
    are present but empty, the corresponding member of the envelope is
    the empty string.[¶](#section-7.5.2-4.42.5){.pilcrow}

    Note: some servers may return a NIL envelope member in the \"present
    but empty\" case. Clients [SHOULD]{.bcp14} treat NIL and the empty
    string as identical.[¶](#section-7.5.2-4.42.6){.pilcrow}

    Note: \[[RFC5322](#RFC5322){.xref}\] requires that all messages have
    a valid Date header field. Therefore, for a well-formed message, the
    date member in the envelope cannot be NIL or the empty string.
    However, it can be NIL for a malformed or draft
    message.[¶](#section-7.5.2-4.42.7){.pilcrow}

    Note: \[[RFC5322](#RFC5322){.xref}\] requires that the In-Reply-To
    and Message-ID header fields, if present, have non-empty content.
    Therefore, for a well-formed message, the in-reply-to and message-id
    members in the envelope cannot be the empty string. However, they
    can still be the empty string for a malformed
    message.[¶](#section-7.5.2-4.42.8){.pilcrow}

    If the From, To, Cc, and Bcc header fields are absent in the
    \[[RFC5322](#RFC5322){.xref}\] header, or are present but empty, the
    corresponding member of the envelope is
    NIL.[¶](#section-7.5.2-4.42.9){.pilcrow}

    If the Sender or Reply-To header fields are absent in the
    \[[RFC5322](#RFC5322){.xref}\] header, or are present but empty, the
    server sets the corresponding member of the envelope to be the same
    value as the from member (the client is not expected to know how to
    do this).[¶](#section-7.5.2-4.42.10){.pilcrow}

    Note: \[[RFC5322](#RFC5322){.xref}\] requires that all messages have
    a valid From header field. Therefore, for a well-formed message, the
    from, sender, and reply-to members in the envelope cannot be NIL.
    However, they can be NIL for a malformed or draft
    message.[¶](#section-7.5.2-4.42.11){.pilcrow}

:   

FLAGS
:   []{#iref-flags-fetch-result-202 .iref} A parenthesized list of flags
    that are set for this message.[¶](#section-7.5.2-4.44){.pilcrow}
:   

INTERNALDATE
:   []{#iref-internaldate-fetch-result-2 .iref} A string representing
    the internal date of the message.[¶](#section-7.5.2-4.46){.pilcrow}
:   

RFC822.SIZE
:   []{#iref-rfc822size-fetch-result-204 .iref} A number expressing the
    size of a message, as described in [Section
    2.3.4](#RFC822.SIZE_message_attribute){.xref}.[¶](#section-7.5.2-4.48){.pilcrow}
:   

UID
:   []{#iref-uid-fetch-result-205 .iref} A number expressing the unique
    identifier of the message.[¶](#section-7.5.2-4.50){.pilcrow}
:   

If the server chooses to send unsolicited FETCH responses, they
[MUST]{.bcp14} include UID FETCH item. Note that this is a new
requirement when compared to
\[[RFC3501](#RFC3501){.xref}\].[¶](#section-7.5.2-5){.pilcrow}

The command continuation request response is indicated by a \"+\" token
instead of a tag. This form of response indicates that the server is
ready to accept the continuation of a command from the client. The
remainder of this response is a line of
text.[¶](#section-7.6-1){.pilcrow}

This response is used in the AUTHENTICATE command to transmit server
data to the client and request additional client data. This response is
also used if an argument to any command is a synchronizing
literal.[¶](#section-7.6-2){.pilcrow}

The client is not permitted to send the octets of the synchronizing
literal unless the server indicates that it is expected. This permits
the server to process commands and reject errors on a line-by-line
basis. The remainder of the command, including the CRLF that terminates
a command, follows the octets of the literal. If there are any
additional command arguments, the literal octets are followed by a space
and those arguments.[¶](#section-7.6-3){.pilcrow}

## [9.](#section-9){.section-number .selfRef} [Formal Syntax](#name-formal-syntax){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-formal-syntax}

The following syntax specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form
(ABNF) notation as specified in
\[[ABNF](#RFC5234){.xref}\].[¶](#section-9-1){.pilcrow}

In the case of alternative or optional rules in which a later rule
overlaps an earlier rule, the rule that is listed earlier [MUST]{.bcp14}
take priority. For example, \"\\Seen\" when parsed as a flag is the
\\Seen flag name and not a flag-extension, even though \"\\Seen\" can be
parsed as a flag-extension. Some, but not all, instances of this rule
are noted below.[¶](#section-9-2){.pilcrow}

Note: \[[ABNF](#RFC5234){.xref}\] rules [MUST]{.bcp14} be followed
strictly; in particular:[¶](#section-9-3){.pilcrow}

1.  [Unless otherwise noted, all alphabetic characters are case
    insensitive. The use of uppercase or lowercase characters to define
    token strings is for editorial clarity only. Implementations
    [MUST]{.bcp14} accept these strings in a case-insensitive
    fashion.[¶](#section-9-4.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-9-4.1}
2.  [In all cases, SP refers to exactly one space. It is NOT permitted
    to substitute TAB, insert additional spaces, or otherwise treat SP
    as being equivalent to linear whitespace
    (LWSP).[¶](#section-9-4.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-9-4.2}
3.  [The ASCII NUL character, %x00, [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be used anywhere,
    with the exception of the OCTET
    production.[¶](#section-9-4.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-9-4.3}

IMAP4rev2 protocol transactions, including electronic mail data, are
sent in the clear over the network, exposing them to possible

negotiated confidentiality protection in the AUTHENTICATE command, or
some other protection mechanism.[¶](#section-11-1){.pilcrow}

### [11.1.](#section-11.1){.section-number .selfRef} [TLS-Related Security Considerations](#name-tls-related-security-consid){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-tls-related-security-consid}

This section applies to use of both the STARTTLS command and the
Implicit TLS port.[¶](#section-11.1-1){.pilcrow}

IMAP client and server implementations [MUST]{.bcp14} comply with
relevant TLS recommendations from \[[RFC8314](#RFC8314){.xref}\]. If
recommendations/requirements in this document conflict with
recommendations from \[[RFC8314](#RFC8314){.xref}\], for example in
regards to TLS ciphersuites, recommendations from this document take
precedence.[¶](#section-11.1-2){.pilcrow}

Clients and servers [MUST]{.bcp14} implement [TLS 1.2](#RFC5246){.xref}
\[[TLS-1.2](#RFC5246){.xref}\] or newer. Use of TLS 1.3
\[[TLS-1.3](#RFC8446){.xref}\] is [RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14}. TLS 1.2 may be
used only in cases where the other party has not yet implemented TLS
1.3. Additionally, when using TLS 1.2, IMAP implementations
[MUST]{.bcp14} implement the TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
cipher suite. This is important as it ensures that any two compliant
implementations can be configured to interoperate. Other TLS cipher
suites recommended in RFC 7525 \[[RFC7525](#RFC7525){.xref}\] are
[RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14}: TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,
TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, and
TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384. All other cipher suites are
[OPTIONAL]{.bcp14}. Note that this is a change from [Section
2.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2595#section-2.1){.relref} of
\[[IMAP-TLS](#RFC2595){.xref}\].[¶](#section-11.1-3){.pilcrow}

The list of mandatory-to-implement TLS 1.3 cipher suites is described in
[Section
9.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8446#section-9.1){.relref} of
\[[TLS-1.3](#RFC8446){.xref}\].[¶](#section-11.1-4){.pilcrow}

During the TLS negotiation \[[TLS-1.3](#RFC8446){.xref}\]
\[[TLS-1.2](#RFC5246){.xref}\], the client [MUST]{.bcp14} check its
understanding of the server hostname against the server\'s identity as
presented in the server Certificate message, in order to prevent on-path
attackers attempting to masquerade as the server. This procedure is
described in
\[[RFC7817](#RFC7817){.xref}\].[¶](#section-11.1-5){.pilcrow}

Both the client and server [MUST]{.bcp14} check the result of the
STARTTLS command and subsequent TLS \[[TLS-1.3](#RFC8446){.xref}\]
\[[TLS-1.2](#RFC5246){.xref}\] negotiation to see whether acceptable
authentication and/or privacy was
achieved.[¶](#section-11.1-6){.pilcrow}

For maximum backward compatibility, the client [MUST]{.bcp14} implement
both TLS negotiation on an Implicit TLS port and TLS negotiation using
the STARTTLS command on a cleartext port.[¶](#section-11.2-1){.pilcrow}

The server [MUST]{.bcp14} implement TLS negotiation on an Implicit TLS
port. The server [SHOULD]{.bcp14} also implement IMAP on a cleartext
port. If the server listens on a cleartext port, it [MUST]{.bcp14} allow
the STARTTLS command on it.[¶](#section-11.2-2){.pilcrow}

Some site/firewall maintainers insist on TLS site-wide and prefer not to
rely on a configuration option in each higher-level protocol. For this
reason, IMAP4rev2 clients [SHOULD]{.bcp14} try both ports 993 and 143
(and both IPv4 and IPv6) concurrently by default, unless overridden by
either user configuration or DNS SRV records
\[[RFC6186](#RFC6186){.xref}\]. A good algorithm for implementing such

Cleartext mail transmission (whether caused by firewall configuration
errors that result in TLS stripping or weak security policies in email
clients that choose not to negotiate TLS in the first place) can enable
injection of responses that can confuse or even cause crashes in email
clients. The following measures are recommended to minimize damage from
them.[¶](#section-11.3-1){.pilcrow}

    considerations related to the PREAUTH
    response.[¶](#section-11.3-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-11.3-2.1}
-   [Many server responses and response codes are only meaningful in
    authenticated or even selected state. However, nothing prevents a
    server (or an on-path attacker) from sending such invalid responses
    in cleartext before STARTTLS/AUTHENTICATE commands are issued.
    Before authentication, clients [SHOULD]{.bcp14} ignore any responses
    other than CAPABILITY and server status responses ([Section
    7.1](#server-status-responses){.xref}), as well as any response
    codes other than CAPABILITY. (In particular, some email clients are

    Clients [SHOULD]{.bcp14} ignore the ALERT response code until after
    TLS (whether using STARTTLS or TLS negotiation on an Implicit TLS
    port) or a SASL security layer with confidentiality protection has
    been successfully negotiated. Unless explicitly allowed by an IMAP
    extension, when not in selected state, clients [MUST]{.bcp14} ignore

## [Appendix A.](#appendix-A){.section-number .selfRef} [Backward Compatibility with IMAP4rev1](#name-backward-compatibility-with){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-backward-compatibility-with}

An implementation that wants to remain compatible with IMAP4rev1 can
advertise both IMAP4rev1 and IMAP4rev2 in its CAPABILITY response /
response code. (Such server implementation is likely to also want to
advertise other IMAP4rev1 extensions that were folded into IMAP4rev2;
see [Appendix E](#changesFromIMAP4rev1){.xref}.) While some IMAP4rev1
responses were removed in IMAP4rev2, their presence will not break
IMAP4rev2-only clients.[¶](#appendix-A-1){.pilcrow}

If both IMAP4rev1 and IMAP4rev2 are advertised, an IMAP client that
wants to use IMAP4rev2 [MUST]{.bcp14} issue an \"ENABLE IMAP4rev2\"
command.[¶](#appendix-A-2){.pilcrow}

When compared to IMAP4rev1, some request data items, corresponding
response data items, and responses were removed in IMAP4rev2. See
[Appendix E](#changesFromIMAP4rev1){.xref} for more details. With the
exception of obsolete SEARCH and RECENT responses, servers advertising
both IMAP4rev1 and IMAP4rev2 would never return such removed response
data items/responses unless explicitly requested by an IMAPrev1
client.[¶](#appendix-A-3){.pilcrow}

Servers advertising both IMAP4rev1 and IMAP4rev2 [MUST NOT]{.bcp14}
generate UTF-8-quoted strings unless the client has issued \"ENABLE
IMAP4rev2\". Consider implementation of mechanisms described or
referenced in \[[IMAP-UTF-8](#RFC6855){.xref}\] to achieve this
goal.[¶](#appendix-A-4){.pilcrow}

Servers advertising both IMAP4rev1 and IMAP4rev2, and clients intending
to be compatible with IMAP4rev1 servers, [MUST]{.bcp14} be compatible
with the Mailbox International Naming Convention described in [Appendix
A.1](#mailbox-i18n){.xref}.[¶](#appendix-A-5){.pilcrow}

Also see [Appendix D](#body-part-64bit){.xref} for special
considerations for servers that support 63-bit body part / message sizes
and want to advertise support for both IMAP4rev1 and
IMAP4rev2.[¶](#appendix-A-6){.pilcrow}

::: {#mailbox-i18n}
::: {#appendix-A.1 .section}
### [A.1.](#appendix-A.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Mailbox International Naming Convention for Compatibility with IMAP4rev1](#name-mailbox-international-namin){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-mailbox-international-namin}

Support for the Mailbox International Naming Convention described in
this section is not required for IMAP4rev2-only clients and servers. It
is only used for backward compatibility with IMAP4rev1
implementations.[¶](#appendix-A.1-1){.pilcrow}

By convention, international mailbox names in IMAP4rev1 are specified
using a modified version of the UTF-7 encoding described in
\[[UTF-7](#RFC2152){.xref}\]. Modified UTF-7 may also be usable in
servers that implement an earlier version of this
protocol.[¶](#appendix-A.1-2){.pilcrow}

In modified UTF-7, printable US-ASCII characters, except for \"&\",
represent themselves; that is, characters with octet values 0x20-0x25
and 0x27-0x7e. The character \"&\" (0x26) is represented by the 2-octet
sequence \"&-\".[¶](#appendix-A.1-3){.pilcrow}

All other characters (octet values 0x00-0x1f and 0x7f-0xff) are
represented in modified base64, with a further modification from
\[[UTF-7](#RFC2152){.xref}\] that \",\" is used instead of \"/\".
Modified base64 [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be used to represent any printing of
a US-ASCII character that can represent itself. Only characters inside
the modified base64 alphabet are permitted in modified base64
text.[¶](#appendix-A.1-4){.pilcrow}

\"&\" is used to shift to modified base64 and \"-\" to shift back to
US-ASCII. There is no implicit shift from base64 to US-ASCII, and null
shifts (\"-&\" while in base64; note that \"&-\" while in US-ASCII means
\"&\") are not permitted. However, all names start in US-ASCII and
[MUST]{.bcp14} end in US-ASCII; that is, a name that ends with a
non-ASCII ISO-10646 character [MUST]{.bcp14} end with a
\"-\".[¶](#appendix-A.1-5){.pilcrow}

The purpose of these modifications is to correct the following problems
with UTF-7:[¶](#appendix-A.1-6){.pilcrow}

1.  [UTF-7 uses the \"+\" character for shifting; this conflicts with
    the common use of \"+\" in mailbox names, in particular USENET
    newsgroup names.[¶](#appendix-A.1-7.1){.pilcrow}]{#appendix-A.1-7.1}
2.  [UTF-7\'s encoding is base64, which uses the \"/\" character; this
    conflicts with the use of \"/\" as a popular hierarchy
    delimiter.[¶](#appendix-A.1-7.2){.pilcrow}]{#appendix-A.1-7.2}
3.  [UTF-7 prohibits the unencoded usage of \"\\\"; this conflicts with
    the use of \"\\\" as a popular hierarchy
    delimiter.[¶](#appendix-A.1-7.3){.pilcrow}]{#appendix-A.1-7.3}
4.  [UTF-7 prohibits the unencoded usage of \"\~\"; this conflicts with
    the use of \"\~\" in some servers as a home directory
    indicator.[¶](#appendix-A.1-7.4){.pilcrow}]{#appendix-A.1-7.4}
5.  [UTF-7 permits multiple alternate forms to represent the same
    string; in particular, printable US-ASCII characters can be
    represented in encoded
    form.[¶](#appendix-A.1-7.5){.pilcrow}]{#appendix-A.1-7.5}

Although modified UTF-7 is a convention, it establishes certain
requirements on the server handling of any mailbox name with an embedded
\"&\" character. In particular, server implementations [MUST]{.bcp14}
preserve the exact form of the modified base64 portion of a modified
UTF-7 name and treat that text as case sensitive, even if names are
otherwise case insensitive or case folded.[¶](#appendix-A.1-8){.pilcrow}

Server implementations [SHOULD]{.bcp14} verify that any mailbox name
with an embedded \"&\" character, used as an argument to CREATE, is: in
the correctly modified UTF-7 syntax; has no superfluous shifts; and has
no encoding in modified base64 of any printing US-ASCII character that
can represent itself. However, client implementations [MUST NOT]{.bcp14}
depend upon the server doing this and [SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} attempt to
create a mailbox name with an embedded \"&\" character unless it
complies with the modified UTF-7 syntax.[¶](#appendix-A.1-9){.pilcrow}

Server implementations that export a mail store that does not follow the
modified UTF-7 convention [MUST]{.bcp14} convert any mailbox name that
contains either non-ASCII characters or the \"&\" character to modified
UTF-7.[¶](#appendix-A.1-10){.pilcrow}

-   [For example, here is a mailbox name that mixes English, Chinese,
    and Japanese text:
    \~peter/mail/&U,BTFw-/&ZeVnLIqe-[¶](#appendix-A.1-11.1){.pilcrow}]{#appendix-A.1-11.1}
-   [For example, the string \"&Jjo!\" is not a valid mailbox name
    because it does not contain a shift to US-ASCII before the \"!\".
    The correct form is \"&Jjo-!\". The string \"&U,BTFw-&ZeVnLIqe-\" is
    not permitted because it contains a superfluous shift. The correct
    form is
    \"&U,BTF2XlZyyKng-\".[¶](#appendix-A.1-11.2){.pilcrow}]{#appendix-A.1-11.2}

## [Appendix B.](#appendix-B){.section-number .selfRef} [Backward Compatibility with BINARY Extension](#name-backward-compatibility-with-){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-backward-compatibility-with-}

IMAP4rev2 incorporates a subset of functionality provided by the BINARY
extension \[[RFC3516](#RFC3516){.xref}\]; in particular, it includes
additional FETCH items (BINARY, BINARY.PEEK, and BINARY.SIZE) but not
extensions to the APPEND command. IMAP4rev2 implementations that support

IMAP4rev2 incorporates most of the functionality provided by the
LIST-EXTENDED extension \[[RFC5258](#RFC5258){.xref}\]. In particular,
the syntax for multiple mailbox patterns is not supported in IMAP4rev2,

IMAP4rev2 increases allowed body part and message sizes that servers can
support from 32 to 63 bits. Server implementations don\'t have to
support 63-bit-long body parts/message sizes; however, client
implementations have to expect them.[¶](#appendix-D-1){.pilcrow}

As IMAP4rev1 didn\'t support 63-bit-long body part / message sizes,
there is an interoperability issue exposed by 63-bit-capable
servers/mailboxes that are accessible by both IMAP4rev1 and IMAP4rev2
email clients. As IMAP4rev1 would be unable to retrieve the full content
of messages bigger than 4 Gb, such servers either need to replace
messages bigger that 4 Gb with messages under 4 Gb or hide them from
IMAP4rev1 clients. This document doesn\'t prescribe any implementation
strategy to address this issue.[¶](#appendix-D-2){.pilcrow}

## [Appendix F.](#appendix-F){.section-number .selfRef} [Other Recommended IMAP Extensions](#name-other-recommended-imap-exte){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-other-recommended-imap-exte}

Support for the following extensions is recommended for all IMAP clients
and servers. While they significantly reduce bandwidth and/or number of
round trips used by IMAP in certain situations, the EXTRA WG decided
that requiring them as a part of IMAP4rev2 would push the bar to
implement too high for new implementations. Also note that the absence
of any IMAP extension from this list doesn\'t make it somehow deficient
or not recommended for use with IMAP4rev2.[¶](#appendix-F-1){.pilcrow}

1.  [Quick Mailbox Resynchronization (QRESYNC) and CONDSTORE extensions
    \[[RFC7162](#RFC7162){.xref}\]. They make discovering changes to
    IMAP mailboxes more efficient, at the expense of storing a bit more
    state.[¶](#appendix-F-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#appendix-F-2.1}
2.  [OBJECTID extension \[[RFC8474](#RFC8474){.xref}\] helps with
    preserving the IMAP client cache when messages are moved/copied or
    mailboxes are
