# RFC 9117 {#rfcnum}

# Revised Validation Procedure for BGP Flow Specifications {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

This document describes a modification to the validation procedure
defined for the dissemination of BGP Flow Specifications. The
dissemination of BGP Flow Specifications as specified in RFC 8955
requires that the originator of the Flow Specification match the
originator of the best-match unicast route for the destination prefix
embedded in the Flow Specification. For an Internal Border Gateway
Protocol (iBGP) received route, the originator is typically a border
router within the same autonomous system (AS). The objective is to allow
only BGP speakers within the data forwarding path to originate BGP Flow
Specifications. Sometimes it is desirable to originate the BGP Flow
Specification from any place within the autonomous system itself, for
example, from a centralized BGP route controller. However, the
validation procedure described in RFC 8955 will fail in this scenario.
The modification proposed herein relaxes the validation rule to enable
Flow Specifications to be originated within the same autonomous system
as the BGP speaker performing the validation. Additionally, this
document revises the AS_PATH validation rules so Flow Specifications
received from an External Border Gateway Protocol (eBGP) peer can be
validated when such a peer is a BGP route
server.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

8955.[¶](#section-abstract-2){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC8955](#RFC8955){.xref}\] defines BGP Network Layer Reachability
Information (NLRI) \[[RFC4760](#RFC4760){.xref}\] that can be used to
distribute traffic Flow Specifications amongst BGP speakers in support
of traffic filtering. The primary intention of
\[[RFC8955](#RFC8955){.xref}\] is to enable downstream autonomous
systems to signal traffic filtering policies to upstream autonomous
systems. In this way, traffic is filtered closer to the source and the
upstream autonomous systems avoid carrying the traffic to the downstream
autonomous systems only to be discarded. \[[RFC8955](#RFC8955){.xref}\]
also enables more granular traffic filtering based upon upper-layer
protocol information (e.g., protocol or port numbers) as opposed to
coarse IP destination prefix-based filtering. Flow Specification NLRIs
received from a BGP peer is subject to validity checks before being
considered feasible and subsequently installed within the respective
Adj-RIB-In.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

The validation procedure defined within \[[RFC8955](#RFC8955){.xref}\]
requires that the originator of the Flow Specification NLRI match the
originator of the best-match unicast route for the destination prefix
embedded in the Flow Specification. The aim is to make sure that only
speakers on the forwarding path can originate the Flow Specification.
Let\'s consider the particular case where the Flow Specification is
originated in any location within the same Local Domain as the speaker
performing the validation (for example, by a centralized BGP route
controller), and the best-match unicast route is originated in another
Local Domain. In order for the validation to succeed for a Flow
Specification received from an iBGP peer, it would be necessary to
disseminate such Flow Specification NLRI directly from the specific
border router (within the Local Domain) that is advertising the
corresponding best-match unicast route to the Local Domain. Those border
routers would be acting as de facto route controllers. This approach
would be, however, operationally cumbersome in a Local Domain with
numerous border routers having complex BGP
policies.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

[Figure 1](#fig_1){.xref} illustrates this principle. R1 (the upstream
router) and RR (a route reflector) need to validate the Flow
Specification whose embedded destination prefix has a best-match unicast
route (dest-route) originated by ASBR2. ASBR2 could originate the Flow
Specification, and it would be validated when received by RR and R1
(from their point of view, the originator of both the Flow Specification
and the best-match unicast route will be ASBR1). Sometimes the Flow
Specification needs to be originated within AS1. ASBR1 could originate
it, and the Flow Specification would still be validated. In both cases,
the Flow Specification is originated by a router in the same forwarding
path as the dest-route. For the case where AS1 has thousands of ASBRs,
it becomes impractical to originate different Flow Specification rules
on each ASBR in AS1 based on which ASBR each dest-route is learned from.
To make the situation more tenable, the objective is to advertise all
the Flow Specifications from the same route
controller.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

This document describes a modification to the validation procedure
described in \[[RFC8955](#RFC8955){.xref}\], by allowing Flow
Specification NLRIs to be originated from a centralized BGP route
controller located within the Local Domain and not necessarily in the
data-forwarding path. While the proposed modification cannot be used for
inter-domain coordination of traffic filtering, it greatly simplifies
distribution of intra-domain traffic filtering policies within a Local
Domain that has numerous border routers having complex BGP policies. By
relaxing the validation procedure for iBGP, the proposed modification
allows Flow Specifications to be distributed in a standard and scalable
manner throughout the Local Domain.[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}

Throughout this document, some references are made to AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE
segments; see Sections [4.1](#REV_ROUTE){.xref} and
[5](#topology){.xref}. If AS_CONFED_SET segments are also present in the
AS_PATH, the same considerations apply to them. Note, however, that the
use of AS_CONFED_SET segments is not recommended
\[[RFC6472](#RFC6472){.xref}\]. Refer to

Step (b) of the validation procedure in [Section
6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8955#section-6){.relref} of
\[[RFC8955](#RFC8955){.xref}\] is defined with the underlying assumption
that the Flow Specification NLRI traverses the same path, in the
inter-domain and intra-domain route distribution graph, as that of the
longest-match unicast route for the destination prefix embedded in the
Flow Specification.[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

In the case of inter-domain traffic filtering, the Flow Specification
originator at the egress border routers of an AS (e.g., RTR-D and RTR-E
of AS1 in [Figure 2](#fig_2){.xref}) matches the eBGP neighbor that
advertised the longest match destination prefix (see RTR-F and RTR-G,
respectively, in [Figure 2](#fig_2){.xref}).[¶](#section-3-2){.pilcrow}

Similarly, at the upstream routers of an AS (see RTR-A and RTR-B of AS1
in [Figure 2](#fig_2){.xref}), the Flow Specification originator matches
the egress iBGP border routers that had advertised the unicast route for
the best-match destination prefix (see RTR-D and RTR-E, respectively, in
[Figure 2](#fig_2){.xref}). This is true even when upstream routers
select paths from different egress border routers as the best route
based upon IGP distance. For example, in [Figure
2](#fig_2){.xref}:[¶](#section-3-3){.pilcrow}

    route[¶](#section-3-4.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-4.1}

It is highly desirable that mechanisms exist to protect each AS
independently from network security attacks using the BGP Flow
Specification NLRI for intra-AS purposes only. Network operators often
deploy a dedicated Security Operations Center (SOC) within their AS to
monitor and detect such security attacks. To mitigate attacks within an
AS, operators require the ability to originate intra-AS Flow
Specification NLRIs from a central BGP route controller that is not
within the data forwarding plane. In this way, operators can direct
border routers within their AS with specific attack-mitigation actions
(drop the traffic, forward to a pipe-cleaning location,
etc.).[¶](#section-3-6){.pilcrow}

In addition, an operator may extend the requirements above for a group
of ASes via policy. This is described in [Section
4.1](#REV_ROUTE){.xref} ([b.2.3](#b.2.3){.xref}) of the validation
procedure.[¶](#section-3-7){.pilcrow}

A central BGP route controller that originates Flow Specification NLRI
should be able to avoid the complexity of having to determine the egress
border router whose path was chosen as the best for each of its
neighbors. When a central BGP route controller originates Flow
Specification NLRI, the rest of the speakers within the AS will see the
BGP route controller as the originator of the Flow Specification in
terms of the validation procedure rules. Thus, it is necessary to modify
step (b) of the validation procedure described in
\[[RFC8955](#RFC8955){.xref}\] such that an iBGP peer that is not within
the data forwarding plane may originate Flow Specification
NLRIs.[¶](#section-3-8){.pilcrow}

Explanation:[¶](#section-4.1-3){.pilcrow}

-   [Receiving either an empty AS_PATH or one with only an
    AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE segment indicates that the Flow Specification was
    originated inside the Local
    Domain.[¶](#section-4.1-4.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.1-4.1}
-   [With the above modification to the \[[RFC8955](#RFC8955){.xref}\]
    validation procedure, a BGP peer within the Local Domain that is not
    within the data-forwarding path can originate a Flow
    Specification.[¶](#section-4.1-4.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.1-4.2}
-   [Disabling the new condition above (see [step b.2.2](#b.2.2){.xref}

    operator knew with certainty that a Flow Specification would not be
    originated inside the Local Domain. An additional case would be if
    it was known for a fact that only the right egress border routers

[Section 6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8955#section-6){.relref}
of \[[RFC8955](#RFC8955){.xref}\] states:[¶](#section-4.2-1){.pilcrow}

This rule prevents the exchange of BGP Flow Specification NLRIs at
Internet exchanges with BGP route servers, which by design don\'t insert
their own AS number into the AS_PATH ([Section
2.2.2.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7947#section-2.2.2.1){.relref}
of \[[RFC7947](#RFC7947){.xref}\]). Therefore, this document also
redefines the \[[RFC8955](#RFC8955){.xref}\] AS_PATH validation
procedure referenced above as follows:[¶](#section-4.2-3){.pilcrow}

-   ::: {#section-4.2-4.1}

    > NLRI.[¶](#section-4.2-4.1.1){.pilcrow}
    :::

Explanation:[¶](#section-4.2-5){.pilcrow}

-   [For clarity, the AS in the left-most position of the AS_PATH means
    the AS that was last added to an
    AS_SEQUENCE.[¶](#section-4.2-6.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.2-6.1}
-   [This proposed modification enables the exchange of BGP Flow
    Specification NLRIs at Internet exchanges with BGP route servers
    while at the same time, for security reasons, prevents an eBGP peer
    from advertising an inter-domain Flow Specification for a
    destination prefix that it does not provide reachability information
    for.[¶](#section-4.2-6.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.2-6.2}
-   [Comparing only the left-most AS in the AS-PATH for eBGP-learned
    Flow Specification NLRIs is roughly equivalent to checking the
    neighboring AS. If the peer is a route server, security is
    necessarily weakened for the Flow Specification NLRI, as it is for
    any unicast route advertised from a route server. An example is
    discussed in the [Security Considerations](#Security){.xref}
    section.[¶](#section-4.2-6.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.2-6.3}
-   [Redefinition of this AS_PATH validation rule for a Flow
    Specification does not mean that the original rule in
    \[[RFC8955](#RFC8955){.xref}\] cannot be enforced as well. Its
    enforcement remains optional per [Section
    6.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4271#section-6.3){.relref} of
    \[[RFC4271](#RFC4271){.xref}\]. That is, a BGP speaker can enforce
    the first AS in the AS_PATH to be the same as the neighbor AS for a
    route belonging to any Address Family (including Flow Specification
    Address Family). If the BGP speaker peer is not a route server, when
    enforcing this optional rule, the security characteristics are
    exactly equivalent to those specified in
    \[[RFC8955](#RFC8955){.xref}\].[¶](#section-4.2-6.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.2-6.4}
-   [Alternatively, enforcing this optional rule for unicast routes
    (even if not enforced on Flow Specification NLRIs) achieves exactly
    the same security characteristics. The reason is that, after all
    validations, the neighboring AS will be the same as the left-most AS
    in the AS-PATH for the unicast route, and the left-most AS in the
    AS_PATH for the unicast route will be the same as the left-most AS
    in the AS_PATH for the Flow Specification NLRI. Therefore, the
    neighboring AS will be the same as the left-most AS in the AS_PATH
    for the Flow Specification NLRI (as the original AS_PATH validation
    rule in \[[RFC8955](#RFC8955){.xref}\]
    states).[¶](#section-4.2-6.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.2-6.5}
-   [Note, however, that not checking the full AS_PATH allows any rogue
    or misconfigured AS the ability to originate undesired Flow
    Specifications. This is a BGP security threat, already present in
    \[[RFC8955](#RFC8955){.xref}\], but out of the scope of this
    document.[¶](#section-4.2-6.6){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.2-6.6}
-   [Using the new rule to validate a Flow Specification route received

    dubious. Although it is conceivable that a router in the same Local
    Domain could send a rogue update, only eBGP risk is considered
    within this document (in the same spirit as the aforementioned

## [5.](#section-5){.section-number .selfRef} [Topology Considerations](#name-topology-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-topology-considerations}

\[[RFC8955](#RFC8955){.xref}\] indicates that the originator may refer
to the originator path attribute (ORIGINATOR_ID) or (if the attribute is
not present) the transport address of the peer from which the BGP
speaker received the update. If the latter applies, a network should be
designed so it has a congruent topology amongst unicast routes and Flow
Specification routes. By congruent topology, it is understood that the
two routes (i.e., the Flow Specification route and its best-match
unicast route) are learned from the same peer across the AS. That would
likely not be true, for instance, if some peers only negotiated one
Address Family or if each Address Family peering had a different set of
policies. Failing to have a congruent topology would result in step
([b.1](#b.1){.xref}) of the validation procedure to
fail.[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

With the additional second condition ([b.2](#b.2){.xref}) in the
validation procedure, non-congruent topologies are supported within the
Local Domain if the Flow Specification is originated within the Local
Domain.[¶](#section-5-2){.pilcrow}

Explanation:[¶](#section-5-3){.pilcrow}

-   ::: {#section-5-4.1}
    Consider the following scenarios of a non-congruent topology without
    the second condition ([b.2](#b.2){.xref}) being added to the
    validation procedure:[¶](#section-5-4.1.1){.pilcrow}

    1.  [Consider a topology with two BGP speakers with two iBGP peering
        sessions between them, one for unicast and one for Flow
        Specification. This is a non-congruent topology. Let\'s assume
        that the ORIGINATOR_ID attribute was not received (e.g., a route
        reflector receiving routes from its clients). In this case, the
        Flow Specification validation procedure will fail because of the
        first condition
        ([b.1](#b.1){.xref}).[¶](#section-5-4.1.2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-5-4.1.2.1}
    2.  [Consider a confederation of ASes with local AS X and local AS Y
        (both belonging to the same Local Domain), and a given BGP
        speaker X1 inside local AS X. The ORIGINATOR_ID attribute is not
        advertised when propagating routes across local ASes. Let\'s
        assume the Flow Specification route is received from peer Y1 and
        the best-match unicast route is received from peer Y2. Both
        peers belong to local AS Y. The Flow Specification validation
        procedure will also fail because of the first condition
        ([b.1](#b.1){.xref}).[¶](#section-5-4.1.2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-5-4.1.2.2}

-   [Consider now that the second condition ([b.2](#b.2){.xref}) is
    added to the validation procedure. In the scenarios above, if Flow

    Condition ([b.2](#b.2){.xref}) will evaluate to true. Therefore,
    using the second condition ([b.2](#b.2){.xref}), as defined by this

This document updates the route feasibility validation procedures for
Flow Specifications learned from iBGP peers and through route servers.
This change is in line with the procedures described in
\[[RFC8955](#RFC8955){.xref}\] and, thus, security characteristics
remain essentially equivalent to the existing security properties of BGP
unicast routing, except as detailed below.[¶](#section-7-1){.pilcrow}

The security considerations discussed in \[[RFC8955](#RFC8955){.xref}\]
apply to this specification as well.[¶](#section-7-2){.pilcrow}

This document makes the original AS_PATH validation rule ([Section
6.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4271#section-6.3){.relref} of
\[[RFC4271](#RFC4271){.xref}\]) again [OPTIONAL]{.bcp14} ([Section
4.2](#AS_PATH){.xref}) for Flow Specification Address Family (the rule
is no longer mandatory as had been specified by
\[[RFC8955](#RFC8955){.xref}\]). If that original rule is not enforced
for Flow Specification, it may introduce some new security risks. A
speaker in AS X peering with a route server could advertise a rogue Flow
Specification route whose first AS in AS_PATH was Y. Assume Y is the
first AS in the AS_PATH of the best-match unicast route. When the route
server advertises the Flow Specification to a speaker in AS Z, it will
be validated by that speaker. This risk is impossible to prevent if the
Flow Specification route is received from a route server peer. If
configuration (or other means beyond the scope of this document)
indicates that the peer is not a route server, that optional rule
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} be enforced for unicast and/or for Flow Specification
routes (as discussed in the [Revision of AS_PATH
Validation](#AS_PATH){.xref} section, just enforcing it in one of those
Address Families is enough). If the indication is that the peer is not a
route server or there is no conclusive indication, that optional rule
[SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} be enforced.[¶](#section-7-3){.pilcrow}

A route server itself may be in a good position to enforce the AS_PATH
validation rule described in the previous paragraph. If it is known that
a route server is not peering with any other route server, it can
enforce the AS_PATH validation rule across all its
peers.[¶](#section-7-4){.pilcrow}

BGP updates learned from iBGP peers are considered trusted, so the
Traffic Flow Specifications contained in BGP updates are also considered
trusted. Therefore, it is not required to validate that the originator
of an intra-domain Traffic Flow Specification matches the originator of
the best-match unicast route for the destination prefix embedded in that
Flow Specification. Note that this trustworthiness consideration is not
absolute and the new possibility that an iBGP speaker could send a rogue
Flow Specification is introduced.[¶](#section-7-5){.pilcrow}

The changes in [Section 4.1](#REV_ROUTE){.xref} don\'t affect the
validation procedures for eBGP-learned
routes.[¶](#section-7-6){.pilcrow}

It\'s worth mentioning that allowing (or making operationally feasible)
Flow Specifications to originate within the Local Domain makes the
network overall more secure. Flow Specifications can be originated more
readily during attacks and improve the stability and security of the
network.[¶](#section-7-7){.pilcrow}
