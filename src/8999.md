QUIC is a connection-oriented protocol between two endpoints. Those
endpoints exchange UDP datagrams. These UDP datagrams contain QUIC
packets. QUIC endpoints use QUIC packets to establish a QUIC connection,
which is shared protocol state between those
endpoints.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

## [2.](#section-2){.section-number .selfRef} [Fixed Properties of All QUIC Versions](#name-fixed-properties-of-all-qui){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-fixed-properties-of-all-qui}

In addition to providing secure, multiplexed transport, QUIC
\[[QUIC-TRANSPORT](#QUIC-TRANSPORT){.xref}\] allows for the option to
negotiate a version. This allows the protocol to change over time in
response to new requirements. Many characteristics of the protocol could
change between versions.[¶](#section-2-1){.pilcrow}

This document describes the subset of QUIC that is intended to remain
stable as new versions are developed and deployed. All of these
invariants are independent of the IP version.[¶](#section-2-2){.pilcrow}

The primary goal of this document is to ensure that it is possible to
deploy new versions of QUIC. By documenting the properties that cannot
change, this document aims to preserve the ability for QUIC endpoints to
negotiate changes to any other aspect of the protocol. As a consequence,
this also guarantees a minimal amount of information that is made
available to entities other than endpoints. Unless specifically
prohibited in this document, any aspect of the protocol can change
between different versions.[¶](#section-2-3){.pilcrow}

[Appendix A](#bad-assumptions){.xref} contains a non-exhaustive list of
some incorrect assumptions that might be made based on knowledge of QUIC
version 1; these do not apply to every version of
QUIC.[¶](#section-2-4){.pilcrow}

Complex fields are named and then followed by a list of fields
surrounded by a pair of matching braces. Each field in this list is
separated by commas.[¶](#section-4-2){.pilcrow}

Individual fields include length information, plus indications about
fixed value, optionality, or repetitions. Individual fields use the
following notational conventions, with all lengths in
bits:[¶](#section-4-3){.pilcrow}

:   

x (A..B):

:   Indicates that x can be any length from A to B; A can be omitted to
    indicate a minimum of zero bits, and B can be omitted to indicate no
    set upper limit; values in this format always end on a byte
    boundary[¶](#section-4-4.4.1){.pilcrow}

:   

x (L) = C:

:   Indicates that x has a fixed value of C; the length of x is
    described by L, which can use any of the length forms

QUIC endpoints exchange UDP datagrams that contain one or more QUIC
packets. This section describes the invariant characteristics of a QUIC
packet. A version of QUIC could permit multiple QUIC packets in a single
UDP datagram, but the invariant properties only describe the first
packet in a datagram.[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

QUIC defines two types of packet headers: long and short. Packets with a
long header are identified by the most significant bit of the first byte
being set; packets with a short header have that bit
cleared.[¶](#section-5-2){.pilcrow}

QUIC packets might be integrity protected, including the header.
However, QUIC Version Negotiation packets are not integrity protected;
see [Section 6](#vn){.xref}.[¶](#section-5-3){.pilcrow}

Aside from the values described here, the payload of QUIC packets is
version specific and of arbitrary length.[¶](#section-5-4){.pilcrow}

A QUIC packet with a long header has the high bit of the first byte set
to 1. All other bits in that byte are version
specific.[¶](#section-5.1-3){.pilcrow}

The next four bytes include a 32-bit Version field. Versions are
described in [Section
5.4](#version){.xref}.[¶](#section-5.1-4){.pilcrow}

The next byte contains the length in bytes of the Destination Connection
ID field that follows it. This length is encoded as an 8-bit unsigned
integer. The Destination Connection ID field follows the Destination
Connection ID Length field and is between 0 and 255 bytes in length.
Connection IDs are described in [Section
5.3](#connection-id){.xref}.[¶](#section-5.1-5){.pilcrow}

The next byte contains the length in bytes of the Source Connection ID
field that follows it. This length is encoded as an 8-bit unsigned
integer. The Source Connection ID field follows the Source Connection ID
Length field and is between 0 and 255 bytes in
length.[¶](#section-5.1-6){.pilcrow}

content.[¶](#section-5.1-7){.pilcrow}

A QUIC packet with a short header has the high bit of the first byte set
to 0.[¶](#section-5.2-3){.pilcrow}

A QUIC packet with a short header includes a Destination Connection ID
immediately following the first byte. The short header does not include
the Destination Connection ID Length, Source Connection ID Length,
Source Connection ID, or Version fields. The length of the Destination
Connection ID is not encoded in packets with a short header and is not
constrained by this specification.[¶](#section-5.2-4){.pilcrow}

The remainder of the packet has version-specific
semantics.[¶](#section-5.2-5){.pilcrow}

### [5.3.](#section-5.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Connection ID](#name-connection-id){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-connection-id}

A connection ID is an opaque field of arbitrary
length.[¶](#section-5.3-1){.pilcrow}

The primary function of a connection ID is to ensure that changes in
addressing at lower protocol layers (UDP, IP, and below) do not cause
packets for a QUIC connection to be delivered to the wrong QUIC
endpoint. The connection ID is used by endpoints and the intermediaries
that support them to ensure that each QUIC packet can be delivered to
the correct instance of an endpoint. At the endpoint, the connection ID
is used to identify the QUIC connection for which the packet is
intended.[¶](#section-5.3-2){.pilcrow}

The connection ID is chosen by each endpoint using version-specific
methods. Packets for the same QUIC connection might use different
connection ID values.[¶](#section-5.3-3){.pilcrow}

:::

::: {#version}
::: {#section-5.4 .section}
### [5.4.](#section-5.4){.section-number .selfRef} [Version](#name-version){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-version}

The Version field contains a 4-byte identifier. This value can be used
by endpoints to identify a QUIC version. A Version field with a value of
0x00000000 is reserved for version negotiation; see [Section
6](#vn){.xref}. All other values are potentially
valid.[¶](#section-5.4-1){.pilcrow}

The properties described in this document apply to all versions of QUIC.
A protocol that does not conform to the properties described in this
document is not QUIC. Future documents might describe additional
properties that apply to a specific QUIC version or to a range of QUIC
versions.[¶](#section-5.4-2){.pilcrow}

::: {#vn}
::: {#section-6 .section}
## [6.](#section-6){.section-number .selfRef} [Version Negotiation](#name-version-negotiation){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-version-negotiation}

A QUIC endpoint that receives a packet with a long header and a version
it either does not understand or does not support might send a Version
Negotiation packet in response. Packets with a short header do not
trigger version negotiation.[¶](#section-6-1){.pilcrow}

A Version Negotiation packet sets the high bit of the first byte, and
thus it conforms with the format of a packet with a long header as
defined in [Section 5.1](#long-header){.xref}. A Version Negotiation
packet is identifiable as such by the Version field, which is set to
0x00000000.[¶](#section-6-2){.pilcrow}

[]{#name-version-negotiation-packet}

::: {#version-negotiation-format}

    Version Negotiation Packet {
      Header Form (1) = 1,
      Unused (7),
      Version (32) = 0,
      Destination Connection ID Length (8),
      Destination Connection ID (0..2040),
      Source Connection ID Length (8),
      Source Connection ID (0..2040),
      Supported Version (32) ...,
    }
:::

[Figure 4](#figure-4){.selfRef}: [Version Negotiation
Packet](#name-version-negotiation-packet){.selfRef}
:::

Only the most significant bit of the first byte of a Version Negotiation
packet has any defined value. The remaining 7 bits, labeled \"Unused\",
can be set to any value when sending and [MUST]{.bcp14} be ignored on
receipt.[¶](#section-6-4){.pilcrow}

After the Source Connection ID field, the Version Negotiation packet
contains a list of Supported Version fields, each identifying a version
that the endpoint sending the packet supports. A Version Negotiation
packet contains no other fields. An endpoint [MUST]{.bcp14} ignore a
packet that contains no Supported Version fields or contains a truncated
Supported Version value.[¶](#section-6-5){.pilcrow}

Version Negotiation packets do not use integrity or confidentiality
protection. Specific QUIC versions might include protocol elements that
allow endpoints to detect modification or corruption in the set of
supported versions.[¶](#section-6-6){.pilcrow}

An endpoint [MUST]{.bcp14} include the value from the Source Connection
ID field of the packet it receives in the Destination Connection ID
field. The value for the Source Connection ID field [MUST]{.bcp14} be
copied from the Destination Connection ID field of the received packet,
which is initially randomly selected by a client. Echoing both
connection IDs gives clients some assurance that the server received the
packet and that the Version Negotiation packet was not generated by an
attacker that is unable to observe packets.[¶](#section-6-7){.pilcrow}

An endpoint that receives a Version Negotiation packet might change the
version that it decides to use for subsequent packets. The conditions
under which an endpoint changes its QUIC version will depend on the
version of QUIC that it chooses.[¶](#section-6-8){.pilcrow}

See \[[QUIC-TRANSPORT](#QUIC-TRANSPORT){.xref}\] for a more thorough
description of how an endpoint that supports QUIC version 1 generates
and consumes a Version Negotiation packet.[¶](#section-6-9){.pilcrow}

## [7.](#section-7){.section-number .selfRef} [Security and Privacy Considerations](#name-security-and-privacy-consid){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-security-and-privacy-consid}

It is possible that middleboxes could observe traits of a specific
version of QUIC and assume that when other versions of QUIC exhibit
similar traits the same underlying semantic is being expressed. There
are potentially many such traits; see [Appendix
A](#bad-assumptions){.xref}. Some effort has been made to either
eliminate or obscure some observable traits in QUIC version 1, but many
of these remain. Other QUIC versions might make different design
decisions and so exhibit different traits.[¶](#section-7-1){.pilcrow}

The QUIC version number does not appear in all QUIC packets, which means
that reliably extracting information from a flow based on
version-specific traits requires that middleboxes retain state for every
connection ID they see.[¶](#section-7-2){.pilcrow}

The Version Negotiation packet described in this document is not
integrity protected; it only has modest protection against insertion by
attackers. An endpoint [MUST]{.bcp14} authenticate the semantic content
of a Version Negotiation packet if it attempts a different QUIC version
as a result.[¶](#section-7-3){.pilcrow}
