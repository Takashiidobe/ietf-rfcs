# RFC 9211 {#rfcnum}

# The Cache-Status HTTP Response Header Field {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

To aid debugging, HTTP caches often append header fields to a response,
explaining how they handled the request in an ad hoc manner. This
specification defines a standard mechanism to do so that is aligned with
HTTP\'s caching model.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

To aid debugging (both by humans and automated tools), HTTP caches often
append header fields to a response explaining how they handled the
request. Unfortunately, the semantics of these header fields are often
unclear, and both the semantics and syntax used vary between
implementations.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

This specification defines a new HTTP response header field,
\"Cache-Status\", for this purpose with standardized syntax and
semantics.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

## [2.](#section-2){.section-number .selfRef} [The Cache-Status HTTP Response Header Field](#name-the-cache-status-http-respo){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-the-cache-status-http-respo}

The Cache-Status HTTP response header field indicates how caches have
handled that response and its corresponding request. The syntax of this
header field conforms to
\[[STRUCTURED-FIELDS](#STRUCTURED-FIELDS){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2-1){.pilcrow}

Its value is a List. Each member of the List represents a cache that has
handled the request. The first member represents the cache closest to
the origin server, and the last member represents the cache closest to
the user (possibly including the user agent\'s cache itself if it
appends a value).[¶](#section-2-2){.pilcrow}

Caches determine when it is appropriate to add the Cache-Status header
field to a response. Some might add it to all responses, whereas others
might only do so when specifically configured to, or when the request
contains a header field that activates a debugging mode. See [Section
6](#security){.xref} for related security
considerations.[¶](#section-2-3){.pilcrow}

An intermediary [SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} append a Cache-Status member to
responses that it generates locally, even if that intermediary contains
a cache, unless the generated response is based upon a stored response
(e.g., 304 (Not Modified) and 206 (Partial Content) are both based upon
a stored response). For example, a proxy generating a 400 response due
to a malformed request will not add a Cache-Status value, because that
response was generated by the proxy, not the origin
server.[¶](#section-2-4){.pilcrow}

When adding a value to the Cache-Status header field, caches
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} preserve the existing field value, to allow debugging
of the entire chain of caches handling the
request.[¶](#section-2-5){.pilcrow}

Each List member identifies the cache that inserted it, and this
identifier [MUST]{.bcp14} be a String or Token. Depending on the
deployment, this might be a product or service name (e.g.,
\"ExampleCache\" or \"Example CDN\"), a hostname
(\"cache-3.example.com\"), an IP address, or a generated
string.[¶](#section-2-6){.pilcrow}

Each member of the list can have parameters that describe that cache\'s
handling of the request. While these parameters are [OPTIONAL]{.bcp14},
caches are encouraged to provide as much information as
possible.[¶](#section-2-7){.pilcrow}

This specification defines the following
parameters.[¶](#section-2-8){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-2.1 .section}
### [2.1.](#section-2.1){.section-number .selfRef} [The hit Parameter](#name-the-hit-parameter){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-the-hit-parameter}

The value of \"hit\" is a Boolean that, when true, indicates that the
request was satisfied by the cache; that is, it was not forwarded, and
the response was obtained from the cache.[¶](#section-2.1-1){.pilcrow}

A response that was originally produced by the origin but was modified
by the cache (for example, a 304 or 206 status code) is still considered
a hit, as long as it did not go forward (e.g., for
validation).[¶](#section-2.1-2){.pilcrow}

A response that was in cache but not able to be used without going
forward (e.g., because it was stale or partial) is not considered a hit.
Note that a stale response that is used without going forward (e.g.,
because the origin server is not available) can be considered a
hit.[¶](#section-2.1-3){.pilcrow}

\"hit\" and \"fwd\" are exclusive; only one of them should appear on
each list member.[¶](#section-2.1-4){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-2.2 .section}
### [2.2.](#section-2.2){.section-number .selfRef} [The fwd Parameter](#name-the-fwd-parameter){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-the-fwd-parameter}

\"fwd\", when present, indicates that the request went forward towards
the origin; its value is a Token that indicates
why.[¶](#section-2.2-1){.pilcrow}

The following parameter values are defined to explain why the request
went forward, from most specific to least:[¶](#section-2.2-2){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

bypass:
:   The cache was configured to not handle this
    request.[¶](#section-2.2-3.2){.pilcrow}
:   

method:
:   The request method\'s semantics require the request to be
    forwarded.[¶](#section-2.2-3.4){.pilcrow}
:   

uri-miss:
:   The cache did not contain any responses that matched the request
    URI.[¶](#section-2.2-3.6){.pilcrow}
:   

vary-miss:
:   The cache contained a response that matched the request URI, but it
    could not select a response based upon this request\'s header fields
    and stored Vary header fields.[¶](#section-2.2-3.8){.pilcrow}
:   

miss:
:   The cache did not contain any responses that could be used to
    satisfy this request (to be used when an implementation cannot
    distinguish between uri-miss and
    vary-miss).[¶](#section-2.2-3.10){.pilcrow}
:   

request:
:   The cache was able to select a fresh response for the request, but
    the request\'s semantics (e.g., Cache-Control request directives)
    did not allow its use.[¶](#section-2.2-3.12){.pilcrow}
:   

stale:
:   The cache was able to select a response for the request, but it was
    stale.[¶](#section-2.2-3.14){.pilcrow}
:   

partial:
:   The cache was able to select a partial response for the request, but
    it did not contain all of the requested ranges (or the request was
    for the complete response).[¶](#section-2.2-3.16){.pilcrow}
:   

The most specific reason known to the cache [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be used, to
the extent that it is possible to implement. See also
\[[HTTP-CACHING](#HTTP-CACHING){.xref}\], [Section

### [2.3.](#section-2.3){.section-number .selfRef} [The fwd-status Parameter](#name-the-fwd-status-parameter){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-the-fwd-status-parameter}

The value of \"fwd-status\" is an Integer that indicates which status
code (see \[[HTTP](#HTTP){.xref}\], [Section
15](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-15){.relref}) the
next-hop server returned in response to the forwarded request. The
fwd-status parameter is only meaningful when fwd is present. If
fwd-status is not present but the fwd parameter is, it defaults to the
status code sent in the response.[¶](#section-2.3-1){.pilcrow}

This parameter is useful to distinguish cases when the next-hop server
sends a 304 (Not Modified) response to a conditional request or a 206
(Partial Content) response because of a range
request.[¶](#section-2.3-2){.pilcrow}

### [2.4.](#section-2.4){.section-number .selfRef} [The ttl Parameter](#name-the-ttl-parameter){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-the-ttl-parameter}

The value of \"ttl\" is an Integer that indicates the response\'s
remaining freshness lifetime (see
\[[HTTP-CACHING](#HTTP-CACHING){.xref}\], [Section
4.2.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111#section-4.2.1){.relref})
as calculated by the cache, as an integer number of seconds, measured as
closely as possible to when the response header section is sent by the
cache. This includes freshness assigned by the cache through, for
example, heuristics (see \[[HTTP-CACHING](#HTTP-CACHING){.xref}\],
[Section
4.2.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111#section-4.2.2){.relref}),

staleness.[¶](#section-2.4-1){.pilcrow}

### [2.5.](#section-2.5){.section-number .selfRef} [The stored Parameter](#name-the-stored-parameter){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-the-stored-parameter}

The value of \"stored\" is a Boolean that indicates whether the cache
stored the response (see \[[HTTP-CACHING](#HTTP-CACHING){.xref}\],
[Section 3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111#section-3){.relref});
a true value indicates that it did. The stored parameter is only
meaningful when fwd is present.[¶](#section-2.5-1){.pilcrow}

### [2.6.](#section-2.6){.section-number .selfRef} [The collapsed Parameter](#name-the-collapsed-parameter){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-the-collapsed-parameter}

The value of \"collapsed\" is a Boolean that indicates whether this
request was collapsed together with one or more other forward requests
(see \[[HTTP-CACHING](#HTTP-CACHING){.xref}\], [Section
4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111#section-4){.relref}). If true,
the response was successfully reused; if not, a new request had to be
made. If not present, the request was not collapsed with others. The
collapsed parameter is only meaningful when fwd is
present.[¶](#section-2.6-1){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-2.7 .section}
### [2.7.](#section-2.7){.section-number .selfRef} [The key Parameter](#name-the-key-parameter){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-the-key-parameter}

The value of \"key\" is a String that conveys a representation of the
cache key (see \[[HTTP-CACHING](#HTTP-CACHING){.xref}\], [Section
2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111#section-2){.relref}) used for
the response. Note that this may be implementation
specific.[¶](#section-2.7-1){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-2.8 .section}
### [2.8.](#section-2.8){.section-number .selfRef} [The detail Parameter](#name-the-detail-parameter){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-the-detail-parameter}

The value of \"detail\" is either a String or a Token that allows
implementations to convey additional information not captured in other
parameters, such as implementation-specific states or other
caching-related metrics.[¶](#section-2.8-1){.pilcrow}

For example:[¶](#section-2.8-2){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-2.8-3}
``` {.lang-http-message .sourcecode}
Cache-Status: ExampleCache; hit; detail=MEMORY
```

[¶](#section-2.8-3){.pilcrow}
:::

The semantics of a detail parameter are always specific to the cache
that sent it; even if a details parameter from another cache shares the
same value, it might not mean the same
thing.[¶](#section-2.8-4){.pilcrow}

This parameter is intentionally limited. If an implementation\'s
developer or operator needs to convey additional information in an
interoperable fashion, they are encouraged to register extension
parameters (see [Section 4](#register){.xref}) or define another header
field.[¶](#section-2.8-5){.pilcrow}

hit:[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-3-2}
``` {.lang-http-message .sourcecode}
Cache-Status: ExampleCache; hit

::: {#section-3-4}
``` {.lang-http-message .sourcecode}
Cache-Status: ExampleCache; hit; ttl=376
```

[¶](#section-3-4){.pilcrow}

A stale hit just has negative freshness, as in this
example:[¶](#section-3-5){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-3-6}
``` {.lang-http-message .sourcecode}
Cache-Status: ExampleCache; hit; ttl=-412

miss:[¶](#section-3-7){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-3-8}
``` {.lang-http-message .sourcecode}
Cache-Status: ExampleCache; fwd=uri-miss
```

[¶](#section-3-8){.pilcrow}

This is an example of a miss that successfully validated on the backend
server:[¶](#section-3-9){.pilcrow}

Cache-Status: ExampleCache; fwd=uri-miss; collapsed=?0
```

[¶](#section-3-14){.pilcrow}
:::

The following is an example of going through two separate layers of
caching, where the cache closest to the origin responded to an earlier
request with a stored response, and a second cache stored that response
and later reused it to satisfy the current
request:[¶](#section-3-15){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-3-16}
``` {.lang-http-message .sourcecode}
Cache-Status: OriginCache; hit; ttl=1100,
              "CDN Company Here"; hit; ttl=545
```

[¶](#section-3-16){.pilcrow}
:::

The following is an example of going through a three-layer caching
system, where the closest to the origin is a reverse proxy (where the
response was served from cache); the next is a forward proxy interposed
by the network (where the request was forwarded because there wasn\'t
any response cached with its URI, the request was collapsed with others,
and the resulting response was stored); and the closest to the user is a
browser cache (where there wasn\'t any response cached with the
request\'s URI):[¶](#section-3-17){.pilcrow}

IANA has created the \"HTTP Cache-Status\" registry at
\<<https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-cache-status>\> and populated
it with the types defined in [Section 2](#field){.xref}; see [Section
4](#register){.xref} for its associated
procedures.[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

IANA has added the following entry in the \"Hypertext Transfer Protocol
(HTTP) Field Name Registry\" defined in \[[HTTP](#HTTP){.xref}\],
[Section
18.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-18.4){.relref}:[¶](#section-5-2){.pilcrow}

Attackers can use the information in Cache-Status to probe the behavior
of the cache (and other components) and infer the activity of those
using the cache. The Cache-Status header field may not create these
risks on its own, but it can assist attackers in exploiting
them.[¶](#section-6-1){.pilcrow}

For example, knowing if a cache has stored a response can help an
attacker execute a timing attack on sensitive
data.[¶](#section-6-2){.pilcrow}

Additionally, exposing the cache key can help an attacker understand
modifications to the cache key, which may assist cache poisoning
attacks. See \[[ENTANGLE](#ENTANGLE){.xref}\] for
details.[¶](#section-6-3){.pilcrow}

The underlying risks can be mitigated with a variety of techniques
(e.g., using encryption and authentication and avoiding the inclusion of
attacker-controlled data in the cache key), depending on their exact
nature. Note that merely obfuscating the key does not mitigate this
risk.[¶](#section-6-4){.pilcrow}

To avoid assisting such attacks, the Cache-Status header field can be
omitted, only sent when the client is authorized to receive it, or sent
with sensitive information (e.g., the key parameter) only when the
client is authorized.[¶](#section-6-5){.pilcrow}
