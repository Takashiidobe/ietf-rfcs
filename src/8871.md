# RFC 8871 {#rfcnum}

# A Solution Framework for Private Media in Privacy-Enhanced RTP Conferencing (PERC) {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

This document describes a solution framework for ensuring that media
confidentiality and integrity are maintained end to end within the
context of a switched conferencing environment where Media Distributors
are not trusted with the end-to-end media encryption keys. The solution
builds upon existing security mechanisms defined for the Real-time
Transport Protocol (RTP).[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

Switched conferencing is an increasingly popular model for multimedia
conferences with multiple participants using a combination of audio,
video, text, and other media types. With this model, real-time media
flows from conference participants are not mixed, transcoded,
translated, recomposed, or otherwise manipulated by a Media Distributor,
as might be the case with a traditional media server or Multipoint
Control Unit (MCU). Instead, media flows transmitted by conference
participants are simply forwarded by Media Distributors to each of the
other participants. Media Distributors often forward only a subset of
flows based on voice activity detection or other criteria. In some
instances, Media Distributors may make limited modifications to RTP
headers \[[RFC3550](#RFC3550){.xref}\], for example, but the actual
media content (e.g., voice or video data) is
unaltered.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

An advantage of switched conferencing is that Media Distributors can be
more easily deployed on general-purpose computing hardware, including
virtualized environments in private and public clouds. Virtualized
public cloud environments have been viewed as less secure, since
resources are not always physically controlled by those who use them.
This document defines improved security so as to lower the barrier to
taking advantage of those environments.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

This document defines a solution framework wherein media privacy is
ensured by making it impossible for a Media Distributor to gain access
to keys needed to decrypt or authenticate the actual media content sent
between conference participants. At the same time, the framework allows
for the Media Distributors to modify certain RTP headers; add, remove,
encrypt, or decrypt RTP header extensions; and encrypt and decrypt RTP
Control Protocol (RTCP) packets \[[RFC3550](#RFC3550){.xref}\]. The
framework also prevents replay attacks by authenticating each packet
transmitted between a given participant and the Media Distributor using
a unique key per endpoint that is independent from the key for media
encryption and authentication.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

This solution framework provides for enhanced privacy in RTP-based
conferencing environments while utilizing existing security procedures
defined for RTP with minimal enhancements.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

Additionally, this solution framework uses the following terms and
abbreviations:[¶](#section-2-2){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

End-to-End (E2E):
:   Communications from one endpoint through one or more Media
    Distributors to the endpoint at the other
    end.[¶](#section-2-3.2){.pilcrow}
:   

Hop-by-Hop (HBH):
:   Communications between an endpoint and a Media Distributor or
    between Media Distributors.[¶](#section-2-3.4){.pilcrow}
:   

Trusted Endpoint (or simply endpoint):
:   An RTP flow-terminating entity that has possession of E2E media
    encryption keys and terminates E2E encryption. This may include
    embedded user conferencing equipment or browsers on computers, media
    gateways, MCUs, media recording devices, and more, that are in the
    trusted domain for a given deployment. In the context of WebRTC
    \[[W3C.CR-webrtc](#W3C.CR-webrtc){.xref}\], where control of a
    session is divided between a JavaScript application and a browser,
    the browser acts as the Trusted Endpoint for purposes of this
    framework (just as it acts as the endpoint for DTLS-SRTP
    \[[RFC5764](#RFC5764){.xref}\] in one-to-one
    calls).[¶](#section-2-3.6){.pilcrow}
:   

Media Distributor (MD):
:   An RTP middlebox that forwards endpoint media content (e.g., voice
    or video data) unaltered \-- either a subset or all of the flows at
    any given time \-- and is never allowed to have access to E2E
    encryption keys. It operates according to the Selective Forwarding
    Middlebox RTP topologies \[[RFC7667](#RFC7667){.xref}\] per the
    constraints defined by the Private Media in Privacy-Enhanced RTP
    Conferencing (PERC) system, which includes, but is not limited to,
    having no access to RTP media plaintext and having limits on what
    RTP header fields it can alter. The header fields that may be
    modified by a Media Distributor are enumerated in [Section
    4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8723#section-4){.relref} of the
    double cryptographic transform specification
    \[[RFC8723](#RFC8723){.xref}\] and chosen with respect to utility
    and the security considerations outlined in this
    document.[¶](#section-2-3.8){.pilcrow}
:   

Key Distributor:
:   An entity that is a logical function that distributes keying
    material and related information to Trusted Endpoints and Media
    Distributor(s) \-- only what is appropriate for each. The Key
    Distributor might be co-resident with another entity trusted with
    E2E keying material.[¶](#section-2-3.10){.pilcrow}
:   

Conference:
:   Two or more participants communicating via Trusted Endpoints to
    exchange RTP flows through one or more Media
    Distributors.[¶](#section-2-3.12){.pilcrow}
:   

Call Processing:
:   All Trusted Endpoints connect to a conference via a call processing
    dialog, e.g., with the \"focus\" as defined in [\"A Framework for
    Conferencing with the Session Initiation Protocol
    (SIP)\"](#RFC4353){.xref}
    \[[RFC4353](#RFC4353){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2-3.14){.pilcrow}
:   

Third Party:
:   Any entity that is not an endpoint, Media Distributor, Key
    Distributor, or call processing entity as described in this
    document.[¶](#section-2-3.16){.pilcrow}

The architecture described in this framework document enables
conferencing infrastructure to be hosted in domains, such as in a cloud
conferencing provider\'s facilities, where the trustworthiness is below
the level needed to assume that the privacy of the participant\'s media
is not compromised. The conferencing infrastructure in such a domain is
still trusted with reliably connecting the participants together in a
conference but is not trusted with keying material needed to decrypt any
of the participant\'s media. Entities in such less-trustworthy domains
are referred to as untrusted entities from this point
forward.[¶](#section-3.1-1){.pilcrow}

It is important to understand that \"untrusted\" in this document does
not mean that an entity is not expected to function properly. Rather, it
means only that the entity does not have access to the E2E media
encryption keys.[¶](#section-3.1-2){.pilcrow}

A Media Distributor forwards RTP flows between endpoints in the
conference while performing per-hop authentication of each RTP packet.
The Media Distributor may need access to one or more RTP headers or
header extensions, potentially adding or modifying a certain subset. The
Media Distributor also relays secured messaging between the endpoints
and the Key Distributor and acquires per-hop key information from the
Key Distributor. The actual media content must not be decryptable by a
Media Distributor, as it is not trusted to have access to the E2E media
encryption keys. The key exchange mechanisms specified in this framework
prevent the Media Distributor from gaining access to the E2E media
encryption keys.[¶](#section-3.1.1-1){.pilcrow}

An endpoint\'s ability to connect to a conference serviced by a Media
Distributor implies that the endpoint is authorized to have access to
the E2E media encryption keys, although the Media Distributor does not
have the ability to determine whether an endpoint is authorized.
Instead, the Key Distributor is responsible for authenticating the
endpoint (e.g., using WebRTC identity assertions
\[[RFC8827](#RFC8827){.xref}\]) and determining its authorization to
receive E2E and HBH media encryption
keys.[¶](#section-3.1.1-2){.pilcrow}

A Media Distributor must perform its role in properly forwarding media
packets while taking measures to mitigate the adverse effects of
denial-of-service attacks (refer to [Section 8](#attacks){.xref}) to a
level equal to or better than traditional conferencing (non-PERC)
deployments.[¶](#section-3.1.1-3){.pilcrow}

A Media Distributor or associated conferencing infrastructure may also
initiate or terminate various messaging techniques related to conference
control. This topic is outside the scope of this framework

Call processing is untrusted in the simple, general deployment scenario.
When a physical subset of call processing resides in facilities outside
the trusted domain, it should not be trusted to have access to E2E key
information.[¶](#section-3.1.2-1){.pilcrow}

Call processing may include the processing of call signaling messages,
as well as the signing of those messages. It may also authenticate the
endpoints for the purpose of call signaling and of subsequently joining
a conference hosted through one or more Media Distributors. Call
processing may optionally ensure the privacy of call signaling messages
between itself (call processing), the endpoint, and other
entities.[¶](#section-3.1.2-2){.pilcrow}

The Key Distributor, which may be co-located with an endpoint or exist
standalone, is responsible for providing key information to endpoints
for both E2E and HBH security and for providing key information to Media
Distributors for HBH security.[¶](#section-3.2.2-1){.pilcrow}

Interaction between the Key Distributor and call processing is necessary
for proper conference-to-endpoint mappings. This is described in
[Section 5.3](#conf-id){.xref}.[¶](#section-3.2.2-2){.pilcrow}

The Key Distributor needs to be secured and managed in a way that
prevents exploitation by an adversary, as any kind of compromise of the
Key Distributor puts the security of the conference at
risk.[¶](#section-3.2.2-3){.pilcrow}

The Key Distributor needs to know which endpoints and which Media
Distributors are authorized to participate in the conference. How the
Key Distributor obtains this information is outside the scope of this
document. However, Key Distributors [MUST]{.bcp14} reject DTLS
associations with any unauthorized endpoint or Media
Distributor.[¶](#section-3.2.2-4){.pilcrow}

The purpose of this framework is to define a means through which media
privacy is ensured when communicating within a conferencing environment
consisting of one or more Media Distributors that only switch, and hence

that a conference between endpoints is taking
place.[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

This framework reuses several specified RTP security technologies,
including the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP)
\[[RFC3711](#RFC3711){.xref}\], Encrypted Key Transport (EKT)
\[[RFC8870](#RFC8870){.xref}\], and

This solution framework focuses on the E2E privacy and integrity of the
participant\'s media by limiting access to only trusted entities to the
E2E key used for authenticated E2E encryption. However, this framework
does give a Media Distributor access to RTP header fields and header
extensions, as well as the ability to modify a certain subset of the
header fields and to add or change header extensions. Packets received
by a Media Distributor or an endpoint are authenticated hop by
hop.[¶](#section-4.1-1){.pilcrow}

To enable all of the above, this framework defines the use of two
security contexts and two associated encryption keys: an \"inner\" key
(a distinct E2E key for each transmitted media flow) for authenticated
encryption of RTP media between endpoints and an \"outer\" key (a HBH
key) known only to a Media Distributor or the adjacent endpoint for the
hop between an endpoint and a Media Distributor or peer endpoint. An
endpoint will receive one or more E2E keys from every other endpoint in
the conference that correspond to the media flows transmitted by those
other endpoints, while HBH keys are derived from the DTLS-SRTP
association with the Key Distributor. Two communicating Media
Distributors use DTLS-SRTP associations directly with each other to
obtain the HBH keys they will use. See [Section
4.5](#key_exchange){.xref} for more details on key
exchange.[¶](#section-4.1-2){.pilcrow}

The double transform \[[RFC8723](#RFC8723){.xref}\] enables endpoints to
perform encryption using both the E2E and HBH contexts while still
preserving the same overall interface as other SRTP transforms. The
Media Distributor simply uses the corresponding normal (single) AES-GCM
transform, keyed with the appropriate HBH keys. See [Section
6.1](#keyinventory){.xref} for a description of the keys used in PERC
and [Section 7](#packetformat){.xref} for a diagram of how encrypted RTP
packets appear on the wire.[¶](#section-4.1-4){.pilcrow}

RTCP is only encrypted hop by hop \-- not end to end. This framework
does not provide an additional step for RTCP-authenticated encryption.
Rather, implementations utilize the existing procedures specified in
\[[RFC3711](#RFC3711){.xref}\]; those procedures use the same outer, HBH
cryptographic context chosen in the double transform operation described
above. For this reason, endpoints [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} send confidential
information via RTCP.[¶](#section-4.1-5){.pilcrow}

To ensure the confidentiality of E2E keys shared between endpoints,
endpoints use a common Key Encryption Key (KEK) that is known only by
the trusted entities in a conference. That KEK, defined in the EKT
specification \[[RFC8870](#RFC8870){.xref}\] as the EKT Key, is used to
subsequently encrypt the SRTP master key used for E2E-authenticated
encryption of media sent by a given endpoint. Each endpoint in the
conference creates an SRTP master key for E2E-authenticated encryption
and keeps track of the E2E keys received via the Full EKT Tag for each
distinct synchronization source (SSRC) in the conference so that it can
properly decrypt received media. An endpoint may change its E2E key at
any time and advertise that new key to the conference as specified in
\[[RFC8870](#RFC8870){.xref}\].[¶](#section-4.2-1){.pilcrow}

Any given RTP media flow is identified by its SSRC, and an endpoint
might send more than one at a time and change the mix of media flows
transmitted during the lifetime of a
conference.[¶](#section-4.3-1){.pilcrow}

Thus, an endpoint [MUST]{.bcp14} maintain a list of SSRCs from received
RTP flows and each SSRC\'s associated E2E key information. An endpoint
[MUST]{.bcp14} discard old E2E keys no later than when it leaves the
conference.[¶](#section-4.3-2){.pilcrow}

If the packet is to contain RTP header extensions, it should be noted
that those extensions are only encrypted hop by hop per
\[[RFC8723](#RFC8723){.xref}\]. For this reason, endpoints [MUST
NOT]{.bcp14} transmit confidential information via RTP header
extensions.[¶](#section-4.3-3){.pilcrow}

To ensure the integrity of transmitted media packets, it is
[REQUIRED]{.bcp14} that every packet be authenticated hop by hop between
an endpoint and a Media Distributor, as well as between Media
Distributors. The authentication key used for HBH authentication is
derived from an SRTP master key shared only on the respective hop. Each
HBH key is distinct per hop, and no two hops ever use the same SRTP
master key.[¶](#section-4.4-1){.pilcrow}

While endpoints also perform HBH authentication, the ability of the
endpoints to reconstruct the original RTP header also enables the
endpoints to authenticate RTP packets end to end. This design yields
flexibility to the Media Distributor to change certain RTP header values
as packets are forwarded. Values that the Media Distributor can change
in the RTP header are defined in \[[RFC8723](#RFC8723){.xref}\]. RTCP
can only be encrypted hop by hop, giving the Media Distributor the
flexibility to (1) forward RTCP content unchanged, (2) transmit compound
RTCP packets, (3) initiate RTCP packets for reporting statistics, or
(4) convey other information. Performing HBH authentication for all RTP
and RTCP packets also helps provide replay protection (see [Section
8](#attacks){.xref}). The use of the replay protection mechanism
specified in [Section
3.3.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3711#section-3.3.2){.relref} of
\[[RFC3711](#RFC3711){.xref}\] is [REQUIRED]{.bcp14} at each
hop.[¶](#section-4.4-2){.pilcrow}

If there is a need to encrypt one or more RTP header extensions hop by
hop, the endpoint derives an encryption key from the HBH SRTP master key
to encrypt header extensions as per \[[RFC6904](#RFC6904){.xref}\]. This
still gives the Media Distributor visibility into header extensions,
such as the one used to determine the audio level
\[[RFC6464](#RFC6464){.xref}\] of conference participants. Note that
when RTP header extensions are encrypted, all hops need to decrypt and
re-encrypt these encrypted header extensions. Please refer to

In addition to the secure tunnel between the Media Distributor and the
Key Distributor, there are two additional types of security associations
utilized as a part of the key exchange, as discussed in the following
paragraphs. One is a DTLS-SRTP association between an endpoint and the
Key Distributor (with packets passing through the Media Distributor),
and the other is a DTLS-SRTP association between peer Media
Distributors.[¶](#section-4.5.1-3){.pilcrow}

Endpoints establish a DTLS-SRTP association over the RTP session with
the Media Distributor and its media ports for the purposes of key
information exchange with the Key Distributor. The Media Distributor
does not terminate the DTLS signaling but instead forwards DTLS packets
received from an endpoint on to the Key Distributor (and vice versa) via
a tunnel established between the Media Distributor and the Key
Distributor.[¶](#section-4.5.1-4){.pilcrow}

When establishing the DTLS association between endpoints and the Key
Distributor, the endpoint [MUST]{.bcp14} act as the DTLS client, and the
Key Distributor [MUST]{.bcp14} act as the DTLS server. The KEK is
conveyed by the Key Distributor over the DTLS association to endpoints
via procedures defined in EKT \[[RFC8870](#RFC8870){.xref}\] via the
EKTKey message.[¶](#section-4.5.1-5){.pilcrow}

The Key Distributor [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} establish DTLS-SRTP associations
with endpoints without first authenticating the Media Distributor
tunneling the DTLS-SRTP packets from the
endpoint.[¶](#section-4.5.1-6){.pilcrow}

Note that following DTLS-SRTP procedures for the cipher defined in
\[[RFC8723](#RFC8723){.xref}\], the endpoint generates both E2E and HBH
encryption keys and salt values. Endpoints [MUST]{.bcp14} either use the
DTLS-SRTP-generated E2E key for transmission or generate a fresh E2E
key. In either case, the generated SRTP master salt for E2E encryption
[MUST]{.bcp14} be replaced with the salt value provided by the Key
Distributor via the EKTKey message. That is because every endpoint in
the conference uses the same SRTP master salt. The endpoint only
transmits the SRTP master key (not the salt) used for E2E encryption to
other endpoints in RTP/RTCP packets per
\[[RFC8870](#RFC8870){.xref}\].[¶](#section-4.5.1-7){.pilcrow}

Media Distributors use DTLS-SRTP directly with a peer Media Distributor
to establish the HBH key for transmitting RTP and RTCP packets to that
peer Media Distributor. The Key Distributor does not facilitate
establishing a HBH key for use between Media
Distributors.[¶](#section-4.5.1-8){.pilcrow}

Following the initial key information exchange with the Key Distributor,
an endpoint is able to encrypt media end to end with an E2E key, sending
that E2E key to other endpoints encrypted with the KEK, and is able to
encrypt and authenticate RTP packets using a HBH key. This framework
does not allow the Media Distributor to gain access to the KEK
information, preventing it from gaining access to any endpoint\'s E2E
key and subsequently decrypting media.[¶](#section-4.5.2-1){.pilcrow}

The KEK may need to change from time to time during the lifetime of a
conference, such as when a new participant joins or leaves a conference.
Dictating if, when, or how often a conference is to be rekeyed is
outside the scope of this document, but this framework does accommodate
rekeying during the lifetime of a
conference.[¶](#section-4.5.2-2){.pilcrow}

When a Key Distributor decides to rekey a conference, it transmits a new
EKTKey message containing the new EKT Key to each of the conference
participants. Upon receipt of the new EKT Key, the endpoint
[MUST]{.bcp14} create a new SRTP master key and prepare to send that key
inside a FullEKTField using the new EKT Key as per [Section

\[[RFC8870](#RFC8870){.xref}\]. In order to allow time for all endpoints
in the conference to receive the new keys, the sender should follow the

4.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8870#section-4.6){.relref} of
\[[RFC8870](#RFC8870){.xref}\]. On receiving a new EKT Key, endpoints
[MUST]{.bcp14} be prepared to decrypt EKT Tags using the new key. The
EKT Security Parameter Index (SPI) field is used to differentiate
between EKT Tags encrypted with the old and new
keys.[¶](#section-4.5.2-3){.pilcrow}

After rekeying, an endpoint [SHOULD]{.bcp14} retain prior SRTP master
keys and EKT Keys for a period of time sufficient for the purpose of
ensuring that it can decrypt late-arriving or out-of-order packets or
packets sent by other endpoints that used the prior keys for a period of
time after rekeying began. An endpoint [MAY]{.bcp14} retain old keys
until the end of the conference.[¶](#section-4.5.2-4){.pilcrow}

Endpoints [MAY]{.bcp14} follow the procedures in [Section
5.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5764#section-5.2){.relref} of
\[[RFC5764](#RFC5764){.xref}\] to renegotiate HBH keys as desired. If
new HBH keys are generated, the new keys are also delivered to the Media
Distributor following the procedures defined in

method.[¶](#section-4.5.2-5){.pilcrow}

At any time, endpoints [MAY]{.bcp14} change the E2E encryption key being
used. An endpoint [MUST]{.bcp14} generate a new E2E encryption key
whenever it receives a new EKT Key. After switching to a new key, the
new key is conveyed to other endpoints in the conference in RTP/RTCP
packets per

## [5.](#section-5){.section-number .selfRef} [Authentication](#name-authentication){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-authentication}

It is important that entities can validate the authenticity of other
entities, especially the Key Distributor and endpoints. Details on this
topic are outside the scope of this specification, but a few
possibilities are discussed in the following sections. The critical
requirements are that (1) an endpoint can verify that it is connected to
the correct Key Distributor for the conference and (2) the Key
Distributor can verify that the endpoint is the correct endpoint for the
conference.[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

Two possible approaches to resolve this situation are identity
assertions and certificate fingerprints.[¶](#section-5-2){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-5.1 .section}
### [5.1.](#section-5.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Identity Assertions](#name-identity-assertions){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-identity-assertions}

A WebRTC identity assertion \[[RFC8827](#RFC8827){.xref}\] is used to
bind the identity of the user of the endpoint to the fingerprint of the
DTLS-SRTP certificate used for the call. This certificate is unique for
a given call and a conference. This certificate is unique for a given
call and a conference, allowing the Key Distributor to ensure that only
authorized users participate in the conference. Similarly, the Key
Distributor can create a WebRTC identity assertion to bind the
fingerprint of the unique certificate used by the Key Distributor for
this conference so that the endpoint can verify that it is talking to
the correct Key Distributor. Such a setup requires an Identity Provider
(IdP) trusted by the endpoints and the Key
Distributor.[¶](#section-5.1-1){.pilcrow}

### [5.2.](#section-5.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Certificate Fingerprints in Session Signaling](#name-certificate-fingerprints-in){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-certificate-fingerprints-in}

Entities managing session signaling are generally assumed to be
untrusted in the PERC framework. However, there are some deployment
scenarios where parts of the session signaling may be assumed
trustworthy for the purposes of exchanging, in a manner that can be
authenticated, the fingerprint of an entity\'s
certificate.[¶](#section-5.2-1){.pilcrow}

As a concrete example, SIP \[[RFC3261](#RFC3261){.xref}\] and the
Session Description Protocol (SDP) \[[RFC4566](#RFC4566){.xref}\] can be
used to convey the fingerprint information per
\[[RFC5763](#RFC5763){.xref}\]. An endpoint\'s SIP User Agent would send
an INVITE message containing SDP for the media session along with the
endpoint\'s certificate fingerprint, which can be signed using the
procedures described in \[[RFC8224](#RFC8224){.xref}\] for the benefit
of forwarding the message to other entities by the focus
\[[RFC4353](#RFC4353){.xref}\]. Other entities can verify that the
fingerprints match the certificates found in the DTLS-SRTP connections
to find the identity of the far end of the DTLS-SRTP connection and
verify that it is the authorized entity.[¶](#section-5.2-2){.pilcrow}

Ultimately, if using session signaling, an endpoint\'s certificate
fingerprint would need to be securely mapped to a user and conveyed to
the Key Distributor so that it can check that the user in question is
authorized. Similarly, the Key Distributor\'s certificate fingerprint
can be conveyed to an endpoint in a manner that can be authenticated as
being an authorized Key Distributor for this
conference.[¶](#section-5.2-3){.pilcrow}

serve.[¶](#section-6.1-1){.pilcrow}

The keys are described in the order in which they would typically be
acquired.[¶](#section-6.1-2){.pilcrow}

:::

While the number of key types is very small, it should be understood
that the actual number of distinct keys can be large as the conference
grows in size.[¶](#section-6.1-5){.pilcrow}

As an example, with 1,000 participants in a conference, there would be
at least 1,000 distinct SRTP master keys, all of which share the same
master salt. Each of those keys is passed through the Key Derivation
Function (KDF) as defined in \[[RFC3711](#RFC3711){.xref}\] to produce
the actual encryption and authentication
keys.[¶](#section-6.1-6){.pilcrow}

Complicating key management is the fact that the KEK can change and,
when it does, the endpoints generate new SRTP master keys that are
associated with a new EKT SPI. Endpoints might retain old keys for a
period of time to ensure that they can properly decrypt late-arriving or
out-of-order packets, which means that the number of keys held during
that period of time might be substantially
higher.[¶](#section-6.1-7){.pilcrow}

A more detailed explanation of each of the keys
follows.[¶](#section-6.1-8){.pilcrow}

The first set of keys acquired are for HBH encryption and decryption.
Per the double transform procedures \[[RFC8723](#RFC8723){.xref}\], the
endpoint performs a DTLS-SRTP exchange with the Key Distributor and
receives a key that is, in fact, \"double\" the size that is needed. The
E2E part is the first half of the key, so the endpoint discards that
information when generating its own key. The second half of the keying
material is for HBH operations, so that half of the key (corresponding
to the least significant bits) is assigned internally as the HBH
key.[¶](#section-6.2-1){.pilcrow}

The Key Distributor informs the Media Distributor of the HBH key.
Specifically, the Key Distributor sends the least significant bits
corresponding to the half of the keying material determined through
DTLS-SRTP with the endpoint to the Media Distributor. A salt value is
generated along with the HBH key. The salt is also longer than needed
for HBH operations; thus, only the least significant bits of the
required length (half of the generated salt material) are sent to the
Media Distributor. One way to transmit this key and salt information is
via the tunnel protocol defined in
\[[PERC-DTLS](#I-D.ietf-perc-dtls-tunnel){.xref}\].[¶](#section-6.2-2){.pilcrow}

No two endpoints have the same HBH key; thus, the Media Distributor
[MUST]{.bcp14} keep track of each distinct HBH key (and the
corresponding salt) and use it only for the specified
hop.[¶](#section-6.2-3){.pilcrow}

The HBH key is also used for HBH encryption of RTCP. RTCP is not
E2E-encrypted in PERC.[¶](#section-6.2-4){.pilcrow}

The Key Distributor sends the KEK (the EKT Key per
\[[RFC8870](#RFC8870){.xref}\]) to the endpoint via the aforementioned
DTLS-SRTP association. This key is known only to the Key Distributor and
endpoints; it is the most important entity to protect, since having
knowledge of this key (and the SRTP master salt transmitted as a part of
the same message) allows an entity to decrypt any media packet in the
conference.[¶](#section-6.3-1){.pilcrow}

Note that the Key Distributor can send any number of EKT Keys to
endpoints. This information is used to rekey the entire conference. Each
key is identified by an SPI value. Endpoints [MUST]{.bcp14} expect that
a conference might be rekeyed when a new participant joins a conference
or when a participant leaves a conference, in order to protect the
confidentiality of the conversation before and after such
events.[¶](#section-6.3-2){.pilcrow}

The SRTP master salt to be used by the endpoint is transmitted along
with the EKT Key. All endpoints in the conference utilize the same SRTP
master salt that corresponds with a given EKT
Key.[¶](#section-6.3-3){.pilcrow}

The Full EKT Tag in media packets is encrypted using a cipher specified
via the EKTKey message (e.g., AES Key Wrap with a 128-bit key). This
cipher is different than the cipher used to protect media and is only
used to encrypt the endpoint\'s SRTP master key (and other EKT Tag data
as per \[[RFC8870](#RFC8870){.xref}\]).[¶](#section-6.3-4){.pilcrow}

The KEK is not given to the Media

As stated earlier, the E2E key determined via DTLS-SRTP [MAY]{.bcp14} be
discarded in favor of a locally generated E2E SRTP master key. While the
DTLS-SRTP-derived SRTP master key can be used initially, the endpoint
might choose to change the SRTP master key periodically and
[MUST]{.bcp14} change the SRTP master key as a result of the EKT Key
changing.[¶](#section-6.4-1){.pilcrow}

A locally generated SRTP master key is used along with the master salt
transmitted to the endpoint from the Key Distributor via the EKTKey
message to encrypt media end to end.[¶](#section-6.4-2){.pilcrow}

Since the Media Distributor is not involved in E2E functions, it does
not create this key, nor does it have access to any endpoint\'s E2E key.
Note, too, that even the Key Distributor is unaware of the locally
generated E2E keys used by each endpoint.[¶](#section-6.4-3){.pilcrow}

The endpoint transmits its E2E key to other endpoints in the conference
by periodically including it in SRTP packets in a Full EKT Tag. When
placed in the Full EKT Tag, it is encrypted using the EKT Key provided
by the Key Distributor. The master salt is not transmitted, though,
since all endpoints receive the same master salt via the EKTKey message
from the Key Distributor. The recommended frequency with which an
endpoint transmits its SRTP master key is specified in

All endpoints have knowledge of the KEK.[¶](#section-6.5-1){.pilcrow}

Every HBH key is distinct for a given endpoint; thus, Endpoint A and
Endpoint B do not have knowledge of the other\'s HBH key. Since HBH keys
are derived from a DTLS-SRTP association, there is at most one HBH key
per endpoint. (The only exception is where the DTLS-SRTP association
might be rekeyed per [Section
5.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5764#section-5.2){.relref} of
\[[RFC5764](#RFC5764){.xref}\] and a new key is created to replace the
former key.)[¶](#section-6.5-2){.pilcrow}

Each endpoint generates its own E2E key (SRTP master key); thus, there
is a distinct E2E key per endpoint. This key is transmitted (encrypted)

### [8.1.](#section-8.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Third-Party Attacks](#name-third-party-attacks){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-third-party-attacks}

Third-party attacks are attacks attempted by an adversary that is not
supposed to have access to keying material or is otherwise not an
authorized participant in the conference.[¶](#section-8.1-1){.pilcrow}

On-path attacks are mitigated by HBH integrity protection and
encryption. The integrity protection mitigates packet modification.
Encryption makes selective blocking of packets harder, but not
impossible.[¶](#section-8.1-2){.pilcrow}

Off-path attackers could try connecting to different PERC entities to
send specifically crafted packets with an aim of forcing the receiver to
forward or render bogus media packets. Endpoints and Media Distributors
mitigate such an attack by performing HBH authentication and discarding
packets that fail authentication.[¶](#section-8.1-3){.pilcrow}

Another attack vector is a third party claiming to be a Media
Distributor, fooling endpoints into sending packets to the false Media
Distributor instead of the correct one. The deceived sending endpoints
could incorrectly assume that their packets have been delivered to
endpoints when they in fact have not. While this attack is possible, the
result is a simple denial of service with no leakage of confidential
information, since the false Media Distributor would not have access to
either HBH or E2E encryption keys.[¶](#section-8.1-4){.pilcrow}

A third party could cause a denial of service by transmitting many bogus
or replayed packets toward receiving devices and ultimately degrading
conference or device performance. Therefore, implementations might wish
to devise mechanisms to safeguard against such illegitimate packets,
such as utilizing rate-limiting or performing basic sanity checks on
packets (e.g., looking at packet length or expected sequence number
ranges), before performing decryption operations that are more
expensive.[¶](#section-8.1-5){.pilcrow}

The use of mutual DTLS authentication (as required by DTLS-SRTP) also
helps to prevent a denial-of-service attack by preventing a false
endpoint or false Media Distributor from successfully participating as a
perceived valid media sender that could otherwise carry out an on-path
attack. When mutual authentication fails, a receiving endpoint would
know that it could safely discard media packets received from the
endpoint without inspection.[¶](#section-8.1-6){.pilcrow}

A malicious or compromised Media Distributor can attack the session in a
number of possible ways, as discussed
below.[¶](#section-8.2-1){.pilcrow}

::: {#denial-of-service}

#### [8.2.1.](#section-8.2.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Denial of Service](#name-denial-of-service){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-denial-of-service}

A simple form of attack is discarding received packets that should be
forwarded. This solution framework does not provide any mitigation
mechanisms for Media Distributors that fail to forward media
packets.[¶](#section-8.2.1-1){.pilcrow}

Another form of attack is modifying received packets before forwarding.
With this solution framework, any modification of the E2E-authenticated
data results in the receiving endpoint getting an integrity failure when
performing authentication on the received
packet.[¶](#section-8.2.1-2){.pilcrow}

The Media Distributor can also attempt to perform resource consumption
attacks on the receiving endpoint. One such attack would be to insert
random SSRC/CSRC values in any RTP packet along with a Full EKT Tag.
 Since such a message would trigger the receiver to form a new
cryptographic context, the Media Distributor can attempt to consume the
receiving endpoint\'s resources. While E2E authentication would fail and
the cryptographic context would be destroyed, the key derivation
operation would nonetheless consume some computational resources. While
resource consumption attacks cannot be mitigated entirely, rate-limiting
packets might help reduce the impact of such
attacks.[¶](#section-8.2.1-3){.pilcrow}

#### [8.2.2.](#section-8.2.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Replay Attacks](#name-replay-attacks){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-replay-attacks}

A replay attack is an attack where an already-received packet from a
previous point in the RTP stream is replayed as a new packet. This
could, for example, allow a Media Distributor to transmit a sequence of
packets identified as a user saying \"yes\", instead of the \"no\" the
user actually said.[¶](#section-8.2.2-1){.pilcrow}

protection as described in [Section

#### [8.2.3.](#section-8.2.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Delayed Playout Attacks](#name-delayed-playout-attacks){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-delayed-playout-attacks}

A delayed playout attack is an attack where media is received and held
by a Media Distributor and then forwarded to endpoints at a later point
in time.[¶](#section-8.2.3-1){.pilcrow}

This attack is possible even if E2E replay protection is in place.
Because the Media Distributor is allowed to select a subset of streams
and not forward the rest to a receiver, such as in forwarding only the
most active speakers, the receiver has to accept gaps in the E2E packet
sequence. The problem here is that a Media Distributor can choose to not
deliver a particular stream for a while.[¶](#section-8.2.3-2){.pilcrow}

While the Media Distributor can purposely stop forwarding media flows,
it can also select an arbitrary starting point to resume forwarding
those media flows, perhaps forwarding old packets rather than current
packets. As a consequence, what the media source sent can be
substantially delayed at the receiver with the receiver believing that
newly arriving packets are delayed only by transport delay when the
packets may actually be minutes or hours
old.[¶](#section-8.2.3-3){.pilcrow}

While this attack cannot be eliminated entirely, its effectiveness can
be reduced by rekeying the conference periodically, since significantly
delayed media encrypted with expired keys would not be decrypted by
endpoints.[¶](#section-8.2.3-4){.pilcrow}

#### [8.2.4.](#section-8.2.4){.section-number .selfRef} [Splicing Attacks](#name-splicing-attacks){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-splicing-attacks}

A splicing attack is an attack where a Media Distributor receiving
multiple media sources splices one media stream into the other. If the
Media Distributor were able to change the SSRC without the receiver
having any method for verifying the original source ID, then the Media
Distributor could first deliver stream A and then later forward stream B
under the same SSRC that stream A was previously using. By including the
SSRC in the integrity check for each packet \-- both HBH and E2E \--
PERC prevents splicing attacks.[¶](#section-8.2.4-1){.pilcrow}

#### [8.2.5.](#section-8.2.5){.section-number .selfRef} [RTCP Attacks](#name-rtcp-attacks){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-rtcp-attacks}

PERC does not provide E2E protection of RTCP messages. This allows a
compromised Media Distributor to impact any message that might be
transmitted via RTCP, including media statistics, picture requests, or
loss indication. It is also possible for a compromised Media Distributor
to forge requests, such as requests to the endpoint to send a new
picture. Such requests can consume significant bandwidth and impair
conference performance.[¶](#section-8.2.5-1){.pilcrow}

### [8.3.](#section-8.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Key Distributor Attacks](#name-key-distributor-attacks){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-key-distributor-attacks}

As stated in [Section 3.2.2](#key_distributor){.xref}, the Key
Distributor needs to be secured, since exploiting the Key Server can
allow an adversary to gain access to the keying material for one or more
conferences. Having access to that keying material would then allow the
adversary to decrypt media sent from any endpoint in the
conference.[¶](#section-8.3-1){.pilcrow}

As a first line of defense, the Key Distributor authenticates every
security association \-- associations with both endpoints and Media
Distributors. The Key Distributor knows which entities are authorized to
have access to which keys, and inspection of certificates will
substantially reduce the risk of providing keys to an
adversary.[¶](#section-8.3-2){.pilcrow}

Both physical and network access to the Key Distributor should be
severely restricted. This may be more difficult to achieve when the Key
Distributor is embedded within, for example, an endpoint. Nonetheless,
consideration should be given to shielding the Key Distributor from
unauthorized access or any access that is not strictly necessary for the
support of an ongoing conference.[¶](#section-8.3-3){.pilcrow}

Consideration should be given to whether access to the keying material
will be needed beyond the conclusion of a conference. If not needed, the
Key Distributor\'s policy should be to destroy the keying material once
the conference concludes or when keying material changes during the
course of the conference. If keying material is needed beyond the
lifetime of the conference, further consideration should be given to
protecting keying material from future exposure. While it might seem
obvious, it is worth making this point, to avoid any doubt that if an
adversary were to record the media packets transmitted during a
conference and then gain unauthorized access to the keying material left
unsecured on the Key Distributor even years later, the adversary could
decrypt the content of every packet transmitted during the
conference.[¶](#section-8.3-4){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-8.4 .section}
### [8.4.](#section-8.4){.section-number .selfRef} [Endpoint Attacks](#name-endpoint-attacks){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-endpoint-attacks}

A Trusted Endpoint is so named because conference confidentiality relies
heavily on the security and integrity of the endpoint. If an adversary
successfully exploits a vulnerability in an endpoint, it might be
possible for the adversary to obtain all of the keying material used in
the conference. With that keying material, an adversary could decrypt
any of the media flows received from any other endpoint, either in real
time or at a later point in time (assuming that the adversary makes a
copy of the media packets).[¶](#section-8.4-1){.pilcrow}

Additionally, if an adversary successfully exploits an endpoint, the
adversary could inject media into the conference. For example, an
adversary could manipulate the RTP or SRTP software to transmit whatever
media the adversary wishes to send. This could involve the reuse of the
compromised endpoint\'s SSRC or, since all conference participants share
the same KEK, the use of a new SSRC or the SSRC value of another
endpoint. Only a single SRTP cipher suite defined provides source
authentication properties that allow an endpoint to cryptographically
assert that it sent a particular E2E-protected packet (namely, Timed
Efficient Stream Loss-Tolerant Authentication (TESLA)
\[[RFC4383](#RFC4383){.xref}\]), and its usage is presently not defined
for PERC. The suite defined in PERC only allows an endpoint to determine
that whoever sent a packet had received the
KEK.[¶](#section-8.4-2){.pilcrow}

However, attacks on the endpoint are not limited to the PERC-specific
software within the endpoint. An attacker could inject media or record
media by manipulating the software that sits between the PERC-enabled
application and the hardware microphone of a video camera, for example.
Likewise, an attacker could potentially access confidential media by
accessing memory, cache, disk storage, etc. if the endpoint is not
secured.[¶](#section-8.4-3){.pilcrow}
