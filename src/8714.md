# RFC 8714 {#rfcnum}

# Update to the Process for Selection of Trustees for the IETF Trust {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

This memo updates the process for selection of Trustees for the IETF
Trust. Previously, the IETF Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC)
members also acted as Trustees, but the IAOC has been eliminated as part
of an update to the structure of the IETF Administrative Support
Activity (IASA). This memo specifies that the Trustees shall be selected
separately.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

This memo obsoletes RFC 4371. The changes relate only to the selection
of Trustees. All other aspects of the IETF Trust remain as they are
today.[¶](#section-abstract-2){.pilcrow}

This memo updates the process for selection of Trustees for the IETF
Trust. Previously, the IETF Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC)
members also acted as Trustees, but the IAOC has been eliminated as part
of an update to the structure of the IETF Administrative Support
Activity (IASA). This memo specifies that the Trustees shall be selected
separately. See [Section
3](#selection){.xref}.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

This memo obsoletes \[[RFC4371](#RFC4371){.xref}\]. The changes relate
only to the selection of Trustees. All other aspects of the IETF Trust
remain as they are today. [Section 2](#ietf-trust){.xref} copies the
definition as it was in \[[RFC4371](#RFC4371){.xref}\], only leaving out
the part about Trustee selection and adding a reference to the IETF
Trust website.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

For a discussion of why this change is needed and a rationale for these
specific changes, see
\[[RFC8715](#RFC8715){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

A Trust (\"the IETF Trust\") has been formed for the purpose of
acquiring, holding, maintaining, and licensing certain existing and
future intellectual property and other property used in connection with
the administration of the IETF. The Trust was formed by the signatures
of its Settlors and initial Trustees. The Settlors, who contributed
initial intellectual property to the Trust, were ISOC and the
Corporation for National Research Initiatives. The Beneficiary of the
IETF Trust is the IETF as a whole.[¶](#section-2-1){.pilcrow}

Further details of the IETF Trust may be found at the IETF Trust\'s
website, \<<https://trustee.ietf.org/>\>.[¶](#section-2-2){.pilcrow}

This document revises the original Trustee selection procedures defined
in \[[RFC4071](#RFC4071){.xref}\] and \[[RFC4371](#RFC4371){.xref}\] to
eliminate the requirement that Trustees be drawn from the members of the
IAOC.[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

In this newly revised IETF Trust structure, there will be five Trustees.
Three shall be appointed by the IETF Nominating Committee (NomCom) and
confirmed by the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG), one shall
be appointed by the IESG, and one shall be appointed by the Internet
Society (ISOC) Board of Trustees. The appointments by the IESG and the
ISOC Board of Trustees do not require
confirmation.[¶](#section-3-2){.pilcrow}

The IETF Trust Chair informs the nominating committee of the Trustee
positions to be reviewed. The IETF Trust will provide a summary of the
expertise desired of the Trustee candidates to each appointing
body.[¶](#section-3-3){.pilcrow}

A change to the Trust Agreement is required to put this change into
effect, and this document requests that the current Trustees make this
change at the earliest convenient time and no later than the end of the
104th IETF meeting in March 2019.[¶](#section-3-4){.pilcrow}

The terms of the appointed Trustees from the IETF NomCom shall be three
years. The initial selection shall be one, two, and three year terms in
order to initially stagger the terms. The other appointments by the IESG
and the ISOC Board of Trustees shall be two year terms, with the initial
terms being one and two years, respectively. The goal of the staggered
initial terms is to minimize potential Trustee turnover in any single
year. To maintain the staggered terms, each appointing body may, at its
discretion, appoint Trustees for shorter terms as needed in exceptional
situations, e.g., for mid-term vacancies or when an appointment is not
ready by the time of the first IETF meeting of the
year.[¶](#section-3-5){.pilcrow}

Once the initial Trustee selections according to the procedures in this
document are complete, and at each subsequent annual meeting of the IETF
Trust (once new Trustees are seated), the Trustees shall elect one
Trustee to serve as IETF Trust Chair by a majority vote of the IETF
Trust.[¶](#section-3-6){.pilcrow}

Trustees appointed by the IETF NomCom may be recalled according to the
recall process described in \[[BCP10](#BCP10){.xref}\]. Trustees
appointed by the IESG or by the ISOC Board of Directors may be recalled
by the appointing body. For appointments made by the IESG, the IESG is
expected to run an open selection process and to consider the necessary
skill set and conflicts of interest as part of that
process.[¶](#section-3-7){.pilcrow}
