# RFC 8726 {#rfcnum}

# How Requests for IANA Action Will Be Handled on the Independent Stream {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) maintains registries to
track code points used by protocols such as those defined by the IETF
and documented in RFCs developed on the IETF
Stream.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

The Independent Submission Stream is another source of documents that
can be published as RFCs. This stream is under the care of the
Independent Submissions Editor (ISE).[¶](#section-abstract-2){.pilcrow}

This document complements RFC 4846 by providing a description of how the
ISE currently handles documents in the Independent Submission Stream
that request actions from IANA. Nothing in this document changes
existing IANA registries or their allocation policies, nor does it
change any previously documented
processes.[¶](#section-abstract-3){.pilcrow}

## [1.](#section-1){.section-number .selfRef} [Introduction](#name-introduction){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-introduction}

The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) maintains registries to
track code points used by protocols such as those defined by the IETF
and documented in RFCs developed on the IETF Stream. A full list of
registries and code points can be found at
<https://www.iana.org/protocols>.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

Requests may be made to IANA for actions to create registries or to
allocate code points from existing registries. Procedures for these
operations are described in
\[[RFC8126](#RFC8126){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

Many requests for IANA action are included in documents that are
progressed for publication as RFCs. RFCs may be sourced from within the
IETF (on the IETF Stream) but may also be sourced from other streams,
including the Independent Submission Stream (the Independent Stream), as
described in \[[RFC4846](#RFC4846){.xref}\]. The Independent Stream is
under the care of the Independent Submissions Editor
(ISE).[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

This document complements \[[RFC4846](#RFC4846){.xref}\] by providing a
description of how the ISE currently handles documents in the
Independent Stream that request actions from IANA. Nothing in this
document changes existing IANA registries or their allocation policies,
nor does it change any previously documented
processes.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

If a case arises that is not precisely covered by this document, the ISE
may discuss a solution with the interested parties, including IANA, the
IESG, the stream managers for other streams, and the authors of an
Independent Submission that requests IANA
action.[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}

::: {#exist}
::: {#section-2 .section}
## [2.](#section-2){.section-number .selfRef} [Allocations from Existing Registries](#name-allocations-from-existing-r){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-allocations-from-existing-r}

Each IANA registry is governed by an allocation policy \-- the rules
that IANA applies to determine which code points can be allocated and
under what circumstances. These policies are described in
\[[RFC8126](#RFC8126){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2-1){.pilcrow}

Documents proceeding from the Independent Stream will always follow the
assignment policies defined for the registries from which they request
allocations. Similarly, all code point assignments are subject to the
oversight of any designated expert (DE) appointed for the
registry.[¶](#section-2-2){.pilcrow}

It should be noted that documents on the Independent Stream can never
result in Standards Track RFCs and Independent Stream documents are
never subject to IETF review. Thus, a registry whose policy is \"IETF
Review\" or \"Standards Action\" \[[RFC8126](#RFC8126){.xref}\] is not
available to Independent Stream documents.[¶](#section-2-3){.pilcrow}

## [3.](#section-3){.section-number .selfRef} [Changing Policies of Existing Registries](#name-changing-policies-of-existi){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-changing-policies-of-existi}

From time to time, a decision is made to change the allocation policy
for a registry. Such changes are normally only made using the allocation
policy of the registry itself and usually require documentation from the
same stream that created the registry.[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

Independent Stream RFCs will not seek to change the allocation policies
of any registries except those created by documents from the Independent
Stream. The list of such registries is itself very limited (see [Section
4](#new){.xref}).[¶](#section-3-2){.pilcrow}

## [4.](#section-4){.section-number .selfRef} [Creating New IANA Registries](#name-creating-new-iana-registrie){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-creating-new-iana-registrie}

Sometimes registries are needed to track a new set of code points for a
new protocol or an extension to an existing
protocol.[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

In general, documents on the Independent Stream cannot request the
creation of a new IANA registry.[¶](#section-4-2){.pilcrow}

The only exception to this rule is when a document to be published in
the Independent Submission Stream requests the allocation of a code
point from an existing registry with the allocation policy Specification
Required, Expert Review, RFC Required, or First Come First Served. Then
the document to be published may also need to create a registry that is
tied to that specific code point and is used for interpreting a
sub-code.[¶](#section-4-3){.pilcrow}

Consider, for example, the \"Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) Schemes\"
registry \[[URL-URIschemes](#URL-URIschemes){.xref}\]. From time to
time, a URI scheme may need a registry of associated parameters; for
example, consider the tel URI scheme that has a register of parameters
called the \"tel URI Parameters\"
\[[URL-telURI](#URL-telURI){.xref}\].[¶](#section-4-4){.pilcrow}

Such examples are rare and only exist to support the allocation from the
base registry. In such cases, where there is an appointed DE for the
existing base registry, the assignment of the individual code point from
the existing base registry and the creation of the new registry can only
happen if the DE approves both actions.[¶](#section-4-5){.pilcrow}

There are several further constraints on the new
registry:[¶](#section-4-6){.pilcrow}

-   [The allocation policy for the new registry may only be First Come
    First Served, RFC Required, Experimental, or Private Use. In
    particular, no registry may be created that would require IETF
    action to achieve a future code point allocation. See [Section
    5](#de){.xref} for an explanation of why the application of
    Specification Required and Expert Review are not acceptable policies
    for any registry created from a document in the Independent
    Stream.[¶](#section-4-7.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-4-7.1}
-   [If the allocation policy for the new registry is First Come First
    Served, the document must contain a brief statement and explanation
    of the expected arrival rate of new registrations over
    time.[¶](#section-4-7.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-4-7.2}
-   [The new registry must contain a clear statement of the escalation
    process for any issues that arise with the registry. A model for
    this statement is as
    follows:[¶](#section-4-7.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-4-7.3}

> This registry was created by \[RFCXXXX\], which was published on the
> Independent Submission Stream. Any issues that arise with the
> management of this registry will be resolved by IANA in consultation
> with the Independent Submissions Editor.[¶](#section-4-8){.pilcrow}

-   [The IESG will be invited to provide its opinions about the
    advisability of the creation of any new registries during its
    conflict review of the document \[[RFC5742](#RFC5742){.xref}\], and
    the ISE will give full consideration to such
    opinions.[¶](#section-4-9.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-4-9.1}

Authors of Independent Submission Stream documents should consider the
most appropriate venue to host such registries, taking into account
where the expertise for managing and reviewing registry assignments may
be found. In some cases, this may mean that registries are hosted by
organizations other than IANA.[¶](#section-4-10){.pilcrow}

::: {#de}
::: {#section-5 .section}
## [5.](#section-5){.section-number .selfRef} [Assigning Designated Experts](#name-assigning-designated-expert){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-assigning-designated-expert}

Some IANA allocation policies (specifically, Specification Required and
Expert Review) utilize the review of a DE. The procedures applicable to
the appointment and actions of a DE are described in [Section
5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8126#section-5){.relref} of
\[[RFC8126](#RFC8126){.xref}\].[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

When a DE is appointed, the position must be maintained and supported by
whoever designated the DE in the first place. That is, someone must
appoint replacement DEs if necessary, and someone must provide a
backstop in case the appointed DEs are
unresponsive.[¶](#section-5-2){.pilcrow}

The ISE will not appoint a DE. That means that no subregistry created
for Independent Stream documents will require the review of a DE. That
means that no new subregistry can be created that uses the Specification
Required or Expert Review policies.[¶](#section-5-3){.pilcrow}

## [6.](#section-6){.section-number .selfRef} [Transfer of Control](#name-transfer-of-control){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-transfer-of-control}

Very rarely, it may be desirable to transfer \"ownership\" of an IANA
registry from the Independent Stream to the IETF Stream. This might
happen, for example, if a protocol was originally documented in the
Independent Stream but has been adopted for work and standardization in
the IETF. Such a transfer may require an IETF Stream RFC to act as the
base reference for the registry and will require discussion and
agreement with the ISE.[¶](#section-6-1){.pilcrow}

Ownership of a registry will not be transferred from the IETF Stream to
the Independent Stream.[¶](#section-6-2){.pilcrow}

## [8.](#section-8){.section-number .selfRef} [Security Considerations](#name-security-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-security-considerations}

There are no direct security considerations arising from this document.
It may be noted that some IANA registries relate to security protocols,
and the stability and proper management of those registries contribute
to the stability of the protocols themselves. That is a benefit for the
security of the Internet and the users of the
Internet.[¶](#section-8-1){.pilcrow}
