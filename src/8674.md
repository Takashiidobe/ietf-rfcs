# RFC 8674 {#rfcnum}

# The \"safe\" HTTP Preference {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

This specification defines a preference for HTTP requests that expresses
a desire to avoid objectionable content, according to the definition of
that term by the origin server.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

This specification does not define a precise semantic for \"safe\".
Rather, the term is interpreted by the server and within the scope of
each web site that chooses to act upon this
information.[¶](#section-abstract-2){.pilcrow}

Support for this preference by clients and servers is
optional.[¶](#section-abstract-3){.pilcrow}

Many web sites have a \"safe\" mode to assist those who don\'t want to
be exposed (or have their children exposed) to content to which they
might object.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

However, that goal is often difficult to achieve because of the need to
go to every web site that might be used and navigate to the appropriate
page (possibly creating an account along the way) to get a cookie
\[[RFC6265](#RFC6265){.xref}\] set in the browser, for each browser on
every device used.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

A more manageable approach is for the browser to proactively indicate a
preference for safe content. A user agent that supports doing so
(whether it be an individual browser or through an operating system HTTP
library) need only be configured once to ensure that the preference is
advertised to a set of sites, or even all
sites.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

This specification defines how to declare this desire in requests as an
HTTP Preference
\[[RFC7240](#RFC7240){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

Note that this specification does not define what content might be
considered objectionable, so the concept of \"safe\" is not precisely
defined. Rather, the term is interpreted by the server and within the
scope of each web site that chooses to act upon this
information.[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}

That said, the intent is to allow end users (or those acting on their
behalf) to express a desire to avoid content that is considered
objectionable within the cultural context of that site; usually (but not
always), the objectionable content is content unsuitable for minors. The
safe preference is not intended to be used for other
purposes.[¶](#section-1-6){.pilcrow}

Furthermore, sending the preference does not guarantee that the web site
will use it or that it will apply a concept of \"objectionable\" that is
consistent with the requester\'s views. As such, its effect can be
described as \"best effort\" and not to be relied upon. In other words,
sending the preference is no more reliable than going to each web site
and manually selecting a safe mode, but it is considerably
easier.[¶](#section-1-7){.pilcrow}

It is also important to note that the safe preference is not a reliable
indicator that the end user is a child; other users might have a desire
for unobjectionable content, and some children might browse without the
preference being set.[¶](#section-1-8){.pilcrow}

Note also that the cultural context applies to the hosting location of a
site, the content provider, and the source of the content. It cannot be
guaranteed that a user agent and origin server will have the same view
of the concept of what is objectionable.[¶](#section-1-9){.pilcrow}

Simply put, it is a statement by (or on behalf of) the end user
indicating that \"if your site has a safe setting, this user is hereby
opting into that, according to your definition of the
term.\"[¶](#section-1-10){.pilcrow}

The mechanism described in this document does not have IETF consensus
and is not a standard. It is a widely deployed approach that has turned
out to be useful and is presented here so that server and browser
implementations can have a common understanding of how it
operates.[¶](#section-1-11){.pilcrow}

This mechanism was presented for publication as an IETF Proposed
Standard but was not approved for publication by the IESG because of
concerns that included the vagueness of the meaning of \"safe\", the
ability of a proxy to insert the hint outside of a user\'s control, the
fact that there was no way to know whether the hint was or was not
applied to the response returned by the server, and the possibility that
the use of this preference may incentivize increased censorship and/or
targeting of minors.[¶](#section-1-12){.pilcrow}

The specification was updated to address those concerns, but the IESG
did not approve progressing this document as an IETF Proposed Standard.
As a result, it has been published in the Independent
Stream.[¶](#section-1-13){.pilcrow}

## [2.](#section-2){.section-number .selfRef} [The \"safe\" Preference](#name-the-safe-preference){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-the-safe-preference}

When present in a request, the safe preference indicates that the user
prefers that the origin server not respond with content that is
designated as objectionable, according to the origin server\'s
definition of the concept.[¶](#section-2-1){.pilcrow}

For example, this is a request that includes the safe
preference:[¶](#section-2-2){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-2-3 .artwork .art-text .alignLeft}
    GET /foo.html HTTP/1.1
    Host: www.example.org
    User-Agent: ExampleBrowser/1.0
    Prefer: safe

[¶](#section-2-3){.pilcrow}
:::

Typically, user agents that emit the safe preference will include it in
all requests with the \"https\" URI scheme, although some might expose
finer-grained controls over when it is sent; this ensures that the
preference is available to the applicable resources. User agents [MUST
NOT]{.bcp14} emit the safe preference on requests with the \"http\" URI
scheme (see [Section 3](#security){.xref}). See [Appendix
A](#browsers){.xref} for more information about configuring the set of
resources the safe preference is sent to.[¶](#section-2-4){.pilcrow}

The safe preference [MAY]{.bcp14} be implemented in common HTTP
libraries (e.g., an operating system might choose to insert the
preference in requests based upon system-wide
configuration).[¶](#section-2-5){.pilcrow}

Origin servers that utilize the safe preference ought to document that
they do so, along with the criteria that they use to denote
objectionable content. If a server has more fine-grained degrees of
safety, it [SHOULD]{.bcp14} select a reasonable default to use and
document that; it [MAY]{.bcp14} use additional mechanisms (e.g., cookies
\[[RFC6265](#RFC6265){.xref}\]) to fine-tune.[¶](#section-2-6){.pilcrow}

A response corresponding to the request above might have headers that
look like this:[¶](#section-2-7){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-2-8 .artwork .art-text .alignLeft}
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Transfer-Encoding: chunked
    Content-Type: text/html
    Preference-Applied: safe
    Server: ExampleServer/2.0
    Vary: Prefer

[¶](#section-2-8){.pilcrow}
:::

Here, the Preference-Applied response header
\[[RFC7240](#RFC7240){.xref}\] indicates that the site has applied the
preference. Servers are not required to send Preference-Applied (even
when they have applied the preference) but are encouraged to where
possible.[¶](#section-2-9){.pilcrow}

Note that the Vary response header needs to be sent if the response is
cacheable and might change depending on the value of the Prefer header.
This is not only true for those responses that are safe but also the
default unsafe response.[¶](#section-2-10){.pilcrow}

See [Section
4.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7234#section-4.1){.relref} of
\[[RFC7234](#RFC7234){.xref}\] for more information about the
interaction between the Vary header field and web
caching.[¶](#section-2-11){.pilcrow}

See [Appendix B](#servers){.xref} for additional advice specific to web
servers wishing to use the safe preference.[¶](#section-2-12){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-3 .section}
## [3.](#section-3){.section-number .selfRef} [Security Considerations](#name-security-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-security-considerations}

The safe preference is not a secure mechanism; it can be inserted or
removed by intermediaries with access to the request stream (e.g., for
\"http\" URLs). Therefore, it is prohibited from being included in
requests with the \"http\" scheme.[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

Its presence reveals information about the user, which may be of
assistance in fingerprinting the user by sites and other entities in the
network. This information provides insight into the preferences of the
user and might be used to make assumptions about user; thus, it could be
used to identify categories of users for purposes such as targeting
(including advertising and identification of minors). Therefore, user
agents [SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} include it in requests when the user has
expressed a desire to avoid such attacks (e.g., some forms of private
mode browsing).[¶](#section-3-2){.pilcrow}

By its nature, including the safe preference in requests does not ensure
that all content will actually be safe; content is safe only when
servers elect to honor it.[¶](#section-3-3){.pilcrow}

Even then, a malicious server might adapt content so that it is even
less safe (by some definition of the word). As such, this mechanism on
its own is not enough to ensure that only safe content is seen; those
who wish to ensure that will need to combine its use with other
techniques (e.g., content filtering).[¶](#section-3-4){.pilcrow}

Furthermore, the server and user may have differing ideas regarding the
semantics of \"safe\". As such, the safety of the user\'s experience
when browsing from site to site, as well as over time, might (and
probably will) change.[¶](#section-3-5){.pilcrow}

## [Appendix A.](#section-appendix.a){.section-number .selfRef} [Sending the \"safe\" Preference from Web Browsers](#name-sending-the-safe-preference){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-sending-the-safe-preference}

As discussed in [Section 2](#safe){.xref}, there are many possible ways
for the safe preference to be generated. One possibility is for a web
browser to allow its users to configure the preference to be
sent.[¶](#section-appendix.a-1){.pilcrow}

When doing so, it is important not to misrepresent the preference as
binding to web sites. For example, an appropriate setting might be a
checkbox with wording such as:[¶](#section-appendix.a-2){.pilcrow}

-   [\[\] Request safe content from web
    sites[¶](#section-appendix.a-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-appendix.a-3.1}

along with further information available upon
request.[¶](#section-appendix.a-4){.pilcrow}

Browsers might also allow the safe preference to be locked to prevent
modification without administrative access or a
passcode.[¶](#section-appendix.a-5){.pilcrow}

Note that this specification does not require browsers to send the safe
preference on all requests, although that is one possible
implementation; alternate implementation strategies include blacklists
and whitelists.[¶](#section-appendix.a-6){.pilcrow}

## [Appendix B.](#section-appendix.b){.section-number .selfRef} [Supporting the \"safe\" Preference on Web Sites](#name-supporting-the-safe-prefere){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-supporting-the-safe-prefere}

Web sites that allow configuration of a safe mode (for example, using a
cookie) can add support for the safe preference incrementally; since the
preference will not be supported by all clients immediately, it is
necessary to have another way to configure
it.[¶](#section-appendix.b-1){.pilcrow}

When honoring the safe preference, it is important that it not be
possible to disable it through the web site\'s interface, since the safe
preference may be configured and locked down by the browser or
computer\'s administrator (e.g., a parent). If the site has such a means
of configuration (e.g., stored user preferences) and the safe preference
is received in a request, the \"safer\" interpretation ought to be
used.[¶](#section-appendix.b-2){.pilcrow}

The appropriate level of safety is a site-specific decision. When
selecting it, sites ought to bear in mind that disabling the preference
might be considerably more onerous than using other means, especially if
the preference is generated based upon the operating system
configuration.[¶](#section-appendix.b-3){.pilcrow}

Sites might offer different levels of safety through web configuration;
they will need to either inform their users of what level the safe hint
corresponds to or provide them with some means of adjusting
it.[¶](#section-appendix.b-4){.pilcrow}

If users express a wish to disable safe mode, the site can remind them
that the safe preference is being sent and ask them to consult their
administrator (since the safe preference might be set by a locked-down
operating system configuration).[¶](#section-appendix.b-5){.pilcrow}

As explained in [Section 2](#safe){.xref}, responses that change based
upon the presence of the safe preference need to either carry the
\"Vary: Prefer\" response header field or be uncacheable by shared
caches (e.g., with a \"Cache-Control: private\" response header field).
This is to avoid an unsafe cached response being served to a client that
prefers safe content (or vice
versa).[¶](#section-appendix.b-6){.pilcrow}
