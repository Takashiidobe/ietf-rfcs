# RFC 8898 {#rfcnum}

# Third-Party Token-Based Authentication and Authorization for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

This document defines the \"Bearer\" authentication scheme for the
Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and a mechanism by which user
authentication and SIP registration authorization is delegated to a
third party, using the OAuth 2.0 framework and OpenID Connect Core 1.0.
This document updates RFC 3261 to provide guidance on how a SIP User
Agent Client (UAC) responds to a SIP 401/407 response that contains
multiple WWW-Authenticate/Proxy-Authenticate header
fields.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) \[[RFC3261](#RFC3261){.xref}\]
uses the same framework as HTTP \[[RFC7230](#RFC7230){.xref}\] to
authenticate users: a simple challenge-response authentication mechanism
that allows a SIP User Agent Server (UAS), proxy, or registrar to
challenge a SIP User Agent Client (UAC) request and allows the UAC to
provide authentication information in response to that
challenge.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

OAuth 2.0 \[[RFC6749](#RFC6749){.xref}\] defines a token-based
authorization framework to allow an OAuth client to access resources on
behalf of its user.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

The OpenID Connect Core 1.0 specification \[[OPENID](#OPENID){.xref}\]
defines a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol, which
enables OAuth/OpenID clients to verify the identity of the user based on
the authentication performed by a dedicated authorization server (AS),
referred to as OpenID Provider (OP), as well as to obtain basic profile
information about the user.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

This document defines the \"Bearer\" authentication scheme for SIP and a
mechanism by which user authentication and SIP registration
authorization is delegated to a third party, using the OAuth 2.0
framework and OpenID Connect Core 1.0. This kind of user authentication
enables single sign-on, which allows the user to authenticate once and
gain access to both SIP and non-SIP services.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

This document also updates \[[RFC3261](#RFC3261){.xref}\] by defining
the UAC procedures when a UAC receives a 401/407 response with multiple
WWW-Authenticate/Proxy-Authenticate header fields, providing challenges
using different authentication schemes for the same
realm.[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}

The tokens used in third-party authorization depend on the type of
AS.[¶](#section-1.3-1){.pilcrow}

An OAuth AS provides the following tokens to a successfully authorized
UAC:[¶](#section-1.3-2){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

Access Token:
:   The UAC will use this token to gain access to services by providing
    the token to a SIP server.[¶](#section-1.3-3.2){.pilcrow}
:   

Refresh Token:
:   The UAC will present this token to the AS to refresh a stale access
    token.[¶](#section-1.3-3.4){.pilcrow}
:   

An OP returns an additional token:[¶](#section-1.3-4){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

ID Token:
:   This token contains a SIP URI associated with the user and other
    user-specific details that will be consumed by the
    UAC.[¶](#section-1.3-5.2){.pilcrow}
:   

Tokens can be represented in two different
formats:[¶](#section-1.3-6){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

Structured Token:
:   A token that consists of a structured object that contains the
    claims associated with the token, e.g., JSON Web Token (JWT), as
    defined in
    \[[RFC7519](#RFC7519){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1.3-7.2){.pilcrow}
:   

Reference Token:
:   A token that consists of an opaque string that is used to obtain the
    details of the token and its associated claims, as defined in
    \[[RFC6749](#RFC6749){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1.3-7.4){.pilcrow}
:   

Access tokens are represented in one of the above two formats. Refresh
tokens usually are represented in a reference format, as this token is
consumed only by the AS that issued the token. The ID token is defined
as a structured token in the form of a JWT.[¶](#section-1.3-8){.pilcrow}

[Figure 1](#figure-1){.selfRef}: [Example Registration
Flow](#name-example-registration-flow){.selfRef}
:::

In step \[1\], the UAC starts the registration process by sending a SIP
REGISTER request to the registrar without any
credentials.[¶](#section-1.4.1-3){.pilcrow}

In step \[2\], the registrar challenges the UA by sending a SIP 401
(Unauthorized) response to the REGISTER request. In the response, the
registrar includes information about the AS to contact in order to
obtain a token.[¶](#section-1.4.1-4){.pilcrow}

In step \[3\], the UAC interacts with the AS via an out-of-scope
mechanism, potentially using the OAuth Native App mechanism defined in
\[[RFC8252](#RFC8252){.xref}\]. The AS authenticates the user and
provides the UAC with the tokens needed to access the SIP
service.[¶](#section-1.4.1-5){.pilcrow}

In step \[4\], the UAC retries the registration process by sending a new
REGISTER request that includes the access token that the UAC obtained in
the step above.[¶](#section-1.4.1-6){.pilcrow}

The registrar validates the access token. If the access token is a
reference token, the registrar [MAY]{.bcp14} perform an introspection
\[[RFC7662](#RFC7662){.xref}\], as in steps \[5\] and \[6\], in order to
obtain more information about the access token and its scope, per
\[[RFC7662](#RFC7662){.xref}\]. Otherwise, after the registrar validates
the token, it inspects its claims and acts upon
it.[¶](#section-1.4.1-7){.pilcrow}

In step \[7\], once the registrar has successfully verified and accepted
the access token, it sends a 200 (OK) response to the REGISTER
request.[¶](#section-1.4.1-8){.pilcrow}

:::

In step \[1\], the UAC interacts with the AS using an out-of-scope
mechanism, potentially using the OAuth Native App mechanism defined in
\[[RFC8252](#RFC8252){.xref}\]. The AS authenticates the user and
provides the UAC with the tokens needed to access the SIP
service.[¶](#section-1.4.2-3){.pilcrow}

In step \[2\], the UAC initiates the registration process by sending a
new REGISTER request that includes the access token that the UAC
obtained in the step above.[¶](#section-1.4.2-4){.pilcrow}

The registrar validates the access token. If the access token is a
reference token, the registrar [MAY]{.bcp14} perform an introspection
\[[RFC7662](#RFC7662){.xref}\], as in steps \[4\] and \[5\], in order to
obtain more information about the access token and its scope, per
\[[RFC7662](#RFC7662){.xref}\]. Otherwise, after the registrar validates
the token, it inspects its claims and acts upon
it.[¶](#section-1.4.2-5){.pilcrow}

In step \[5\], once the registrar has successfully verified and accepted
the access token, it sends a 200 (OK) response to the REGISTER
request.[¶](#section-1.4.2-6){.pilcrow}

of \[[RFC3261](#RFC3261){.xref}\] defines the SIP procedures for the

When a UAC sends a request without credentials (or with invalid
credentials), it could receive either a 401 (Unauthorized) response with
a WWW-Authenticate header field or a 407 (Proxy Authentication Required)
response with a Proxy-Authenticate header field. If the WWW-Authenticate
or Proxy-Authenticate header field indicates \"Bearer\" scheme
authentication and contains an address to an AS, the UAC contacts the AS
in order to obtain tokens and includes the requested scopes, based on a
local configuration ([Figure 1](#fig-register-flow){.xref}). The UAC
[MUST]{.bcp14} check the AS URL received in the 401/407 response against
a list of trusted ASs configured on the UAC in order to prevent several
classes of possible vulnerabilities when a client blindly attempts to
use any provided AS.[¶](#section-2.1.1-1){.pilcrow}

The detailed OAuth2 procedure to authenticate the user and obtain these
tokens is out of scope of this document. The address of the AS might
already be known to the UAC via configuration. In such cases, the UAC
can contact the AS for tokens before it sends a SIP request ([Figure
2](#fig-config-ua){.xref}). Procedures for native applications are
defined in \[[RFC8252](#RFC8252){.xref}\]. When using the mechanism
defined in \[[RFC8252](#RFC8252){.xref}\], the user of the UAC will be
directed to interact with the AS using a web browser, which allows the
AS to prompt the user for multi-factor authentication, to redirect the
user to third-party identity providers, and to enable the use of single
sign-on sessions.[¶](#section-2.1.1-2){.pilcrow}

The tokens returned to the UAC depend on the type of AS; an OAuth AS
provides an access token and, optionally, a refresh token
\[[RFC6749](#RFC6749){.xref}\]. The refresh token is only used between
the UAC and the AS. If the AS provides a refresh token to the UAC, the
UAC uses it to request a new access token from the AS before the
currently used access token expires (\[[RFC6749](#RFC6749){.xref}\],
[Section
1.5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749#section-1.5){.relref}). If
the AS does not provide a refresh token, the UAC needs to reauthenticate
the user in order to get a new access token before the currently used
access token expires. An OP returns an additional ID token that contains
claims about the authentication of the user by an authorization server.
The ID token can potentially include other optional claims about the
user, e.g., the SIP URI, that will be consumed by the UAC and later used
to register with the registrar.[¶](#section-2.1.1-3){.pilcrow}

If the UAC receives a 401/407 response with multiple WWW-
Authenticate/Proxy-Authenticate header fields, providing challenges
using different authentication schemes for the same realm, the UAC
provides credentials for one of the schemes that it supports, based on
local policy.[¶](#section-2.1.1-4){.pilcrow}

NOTE: At the time of writing, detailed procedures for the cases where a
UAC receives multiple different authentication schemes had not been
defined. A future specification might define such
procedures.[¶](#section-2.1.1-5.1){.pilcrow}

NOTE: The address of the AS might be known to the UAC, e.g., using means
of configuration, in which case the UAC can contact the AS in order to
obtain the access token before it sends SIP request without
credentials.[¶](#section-2.1.1-6.1){.pilcrow}

Per \[[RFC3261](#RFC3261){.xref}\], \"the realm string alone defines the

The scope parameter can be used by the registrar/proxy to indicate to
the UAC the minimum scope that must be associated with the access token

the value of the scope parameter is expressed as a list of

## [5.](#section-5){.section-number .selfRef} [Security Considerations](#name-security-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-security-considerations}

The security considerations for OAuth are defined in
\[[RFC6749](#RFC6749){.xref}\]. The security considerations for
\"Bearer\" tokens are defined in \[[RFC6750](#RFC6750){.xref}\]. The
security considerations for JWTs are defined in
\[[RFC7519](#RFC7519){.xref}\]. These security considerations also apply
to SIP usage of access tokens, as defined in this
document.[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC6749](#RFC6749){.xref}\] mandates that access tokens are protected
with TLS when in transit. However, SIP makes use of intermediary SIP
proxies, and TLS only guarantees hop-to-hop protection when used to
protect SIP signaling. Therefore, the access token [MUST]{.bcp14} be
protected in a way so that only authorized SIP servers will have access
to it. SIP endpoints that support this document [MUST]{.bcp14} use
encrypted JWTs \[[RFC7519](#RFC7519){.xref}\] for encoding and
protecting access tokens when they are included in SIP requests, unless
some other mechanism is used to guarantee that only authorized SIP
endpoints have access to the access token. TLS can still be used for
protecting traffic between SIP endpoints and the AS, as defined in
\[[RFC6749](#RFC6749){.xref}\].[¶](#section-5-2){.pilcrow}

Single Sign-On (SSO) enables the user to use one set of credentials to
authenticate once and gain access to multiple SIP and non-SIP services
using access token(s). If the SSO login is compromised, that single
point of compromise has a much broader effect than is the case without
SSO. Further, an attacker can often use a compromised account to set up
Single Sign-On for other services that the victim has not established an
account with and sometimes can even switch a dedicated account into SSO
mode, creating a still broader attack.[¶](#section-5-3){.pilcrow}

Because of that, it is critical to make sure that extra security
measures be taken to safeguard credentials used for Single Sign-On.
Examples of such measures include a long passphrase instead of a
password, enabling multi-factor authentication, and the use of the
native platform browser when possible, as defined in
\[[RFC8252](#RFC8252){.xref}\].[¶](#section-5-4){.pilcrow}

Although this is out of scope for this document, it is important to
carefully consider the claims provided in the tokens used to access
these services to make sure of the privacy of the user accessing these
services. As mentioned above, this document calls for encrypting JWTs
representing the access token.[¶](#section-5-5){.pilcrow}

It is important that both parties participating in SSO provide
mechanisms for users to sever the SSO relationship so that it is
possible without undue difficulty to mitigate a compromise that has
already happened.[¶](#section-5-6){.pilcrow}

The operator of an SSO authentication system has access to private
information about sites and services that their users log into and even,
to some extent, their usage patterns. It\'s important to call these out
in privacy disclosures and policies and to make sure that users can be
aware of the trade-offs between convenience and privacy when they choose
to use SSO.[¶](#section-5-7){.pilcrow}

When a registrar chooses to challenge a REGISTER request, if the
registrar can provide access to different levels of services, it is
[RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14} that the registrar include a scope in the response
in order to indicate the minimum scope needed to register and access
basic services. The access token might include an extended scope that
gives the user access to more advanced features beyond basic services.
In SIP, the AS administrator will typically decide what level of access
is provided for a given user.[¶](#section-5-8){.pilcrow}

The UAC [MUST]{.bcp14} check the AS URL received in the 401/407 response
against a list of trusted ASs configured on the UAC in order to prevent
several classes of possible vulnerabilities when a client blindly
attempts to use any provided AS.[¶](#section-5-9){.pilcrow}
