The TLS protocol \[[RFC8446](#RFC8446){.xref}\] allows the use of X.509
certificates and raw public keys to authenticate servers and clients.
This document describes an experimental extension following the
procedures laid out by \[[RFC7250](#RFC7250){.xref}\] to support use of
the certificate format specified by the IEEE in
\[[IEEE1609.2](#IEEE1609.2){.xref}\] and profiled by the European
Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) in
\[[TS103097](#TS103097){.xref}\]. These standards specify secure
communications in vehicular environments. These certificates are
referred to in this document as Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS)
Certificates.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

The certificate types are optimized for bandwidth and processing time to
support delay-sensitive applications and also to provide both
authentication and authorization information to enable fast access
control decisions in ad hoc networks found in Intelligent Transport
Systems (ITS). The standards specify different types of certificates to
support a full Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) specification; the
certificates to be used in this context are end-entity certificates,
i.e., certificates that have the IEEE 1609.2 appPermissions field
present.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

Use of ITS certificates is becoming widespread in the ITS setting. ITS
communications, in practice, make heavy use of 10 MHz channels with a
typical throughput of 6 Mbps. (The 802.11OCB modulation that gives this
throughput is not the one that gives the highest throughput, but it
provides for a robust signal over a range up to 300-500 m, which is the
\"sweet spot\" communications range for ITS operations like collision
avoidance). The compact nature of ITS certificates as opposed to X.509
certificates makes them appropriate for this
setting.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

The ITS certificates are also suited to the machine-to-machine (M2M) ad
hoc network setting because their direct encoding of permissions (see
[Section 7.4](#ITS-permissions){.xref}) allows a receiver to make an
immediate accept/deny decision about an incoming message without having
to refer to a remote identity and access management server. The EU has
committed to the use of ITS certificates in Cooperative Intelligent
Transport Systems deployments. A multi-year project developed a
certificate policy for the use of ITS certificates, including a
specification of how different root certificates can be trusted across
the system (hosted at
\<<https://ec.europa.eu/transport/themes/its/c-its_en>\>, direct link at
\<<https://ec.europa.eu/transport/sites/transport/files/c-its_certificate_policy_release_1.pdf>\>).[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

The EU has committed funding for the first five years of operation of
the top-level Trust List Manager entity, enabling organizations such as
motor vehicle original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and national road
authorities to create root certificate authorities (CAs) and have them
trusted. In the US, the US Department of Transportation (USDOT)
published a proposed regulation, active as of late 2019 though not
rapidly progressing, requiring all light vehicles in the US to implement
vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications, including the use of ITS
certificates (available at
\<<https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/01/12/2016-31059/federal-motor-vehicle-safety-standards-v2v-communications>\>).
As of 2019, ITS deployments across the US, Europe, and Australia were
using ITS certificates. Volkswagen has committed to deploying V2X using
ITS certificates. New York, Tampa, and Wyoming are deploying traffic
management systems using ITS certificates. GM deployed V2X in the
Cadillac CTS, using ITS certificates.[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}

ITS certificates are also used in a number of standards that build on
top of the foundational IEEE and ETSI standards, particularly the
Society of Automobile Engineers (SAE) J2945/x series of standards for
applications and ISO 21177 \[[ISO21177](#ISO21177){.xref}\], which
builds a framework for exchanging multiple authentication tokens on top
of the TLS variant specified in this
document.[¶](#section-1-6){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-1.1 .section}
### [1.1.](#section-1.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Experiment Overview](#name-experiment-overview){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-experiment-overview}

This document describes an experimental extension to the TLS security
model. It uses a form of certificate that has not previously been used
in the Internet. Systems using this Experimental approach are segregated
from systems using standard TLS by the use of a new certificate type
value, reserved through IANA (see [Section 9](#IANA){.xref}). An
implementation of TLS that is not involved in the Experiment will not
recognize this new certificate type and will not participate in the
experiment; TLS sessions will either negotiate the use of existing X.509
certificates or fail to be established.[¶](#section-1.1-1){.pilcrow}

This extension has been encouraged by stakeholders in the Cooperative
ITS community in order to support ITS use-case deployment, and it is
anticipated that its use will be
widespread.[¶](#section-1.1-2){.pilcrow}

The TLS extensions \"client_certificate_type\" and
\"server_certificate_type\" \[[RFC7250](#RFC7250){.xref}\] are used to
negotiate the type of Certificate messages used in TLS to authenticate
the server and, optionally, the client. Using separate extensions allows
for mixed deployments where the client and server can use certificates
of different types. It is expected that ITS deployments will see both
peers using ITS certificates due to the homogeneity of the ecosystem,
but there is no barrier at a technical level that prevents mixed
certificate usage. This document defines a new certificate type,
1609Dot2, for usage with TLS 1.3. The updated CertificateType
enumeration and corresponding addition to the CertificateEntry structure
are shown below. CertificateType values are sent in the
\"server_certificate_type\" and \"client_certificate_type\" extensions,
and the CertificateEntry structures are included in the certificate
chain sent in the Certificate message. In the case of TLS 1.3, the
\"client_certificate_type\" [SHALL]{.bcp14} contain a list of supported
certificate types proposed by the client as provided in the figure
below:[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

   } CertificateType;

   struct {
       select (certificate_type) {

           /* certificate type defined in this document.*/
            case 1609Dot2:
            opaque cert_data<1..2^24-1>;

            /* RawPublicKey defined in RFC 7250*/
           case RawPublicKey:

As per \[[RFC7250](#RFC7250){.xref}\], the server processes the received
\[endpoint\]\_certificate_type extension(s) and selects one of the
offered certificate types, returning the negotiated value in its
EncryptedExtensions (TLS 1.3) message. Note that there is no requirement
for the negotiated value to be the same in client_certificate_type and
server_certificate_type extensions sent in the same
message.[¶](#section-3-3){.pilcrow}

:::

In the case of TLS 1.3, in order to negotiate the support of ITS
certificate-based authentication, clients and servers include the
extension of type \"client_certificate_type\" and
\"server_certificate_type\" in the extended Client Hello and
\"EncryptedExtensions\".[¶](#section-4-3){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-4.1 .section}
### [4.1.](#section-4.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Client Hello](#name-client-hello){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-client-hello}

In order to indicate the support of ITS certificates, a client
[MUST]{.bcp14} include an extension of type \"client_certificate_type\"
or \"server_certificate_type\" in the extended Client Hello message as
described in [Section
4.1.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8446#section-4.1.2){.relref} of
\[[RFC8446](#RFC8446){.xref}\] (TLS 1.3).[¶](#section-4.1-1){.pilcrow}

For TLS 1.3, the rules for when the Client Certificate and
CertificateVerify messages appear are as
follows:[¶](#section-4.1-2){.pilcrow}

-   [The client\'s Certificate message is present if and only if the
    server sent a CertificateRequest
    message.[¶](#section-4.1-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.1-3.1}
-   [The client\'s CertificateVerify message is present if and only if
    the client\'s Certificate message is present and contains a
    non-empty
    certificate_list.[¶](#section-4.1-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.1-3.2}

For maximum compatibility, all implementations [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be
prepared to handle \"potentially\" extraneous certificates and arbitrary
orderings from any TLS version, with the exception of the end-entity
certificate, which [MUST]{.bcp14} be first.[¶](#section-4.1-4){.pilcrow}

When the server receives the Client Hello containing the
client_certificate_type extension and/or the server_certificate_type
extension, the following scenarios are
possible:[¶](#section-4.2-1){.pilcrow}

-   [If both the client and server indicate support for the ITS
    certificate type, the server [MAY]{.bcp14} select the first (most
    preferred) certificate type from the client\'s list that is
    supported by both
    peers.[¶](#section-4.2-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.2-2.1}
-   [The server does not support any of the proposed certificate types
    and terminates the session with a fatal alert of type
    \"unsupported_certificate\".[¶](#section-4.2-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.2-2.2}
-   [The server supports the certificate types specified in this
    document. In this case, it [MAY]{.bcp14} respond with a certificate
    of this type. It [MAY]{.bcp14} also include the
    client_certificate_type extension in Encrypted Extension. Then, the
    server requests a certificate from the client (via the
    CertificateRequest
    message).[¶](#section-4.2-2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.2-2.3}

The certificates in the TLS client or server certificate chain
[MAY]{.bcp14} be sent as part of the handshake, [MAY]{.bcp14} be
obtained from an online repository, or might already be known to and
cached at the endpoint. If the handshake does not contain all the
certificates in the chain, and the endpoint cannot access the repository
and does not already know the certificates from the chain, then it
[SHALL]{.bcp14} reject the other endpoint\'s certificate and close the
connection. Protocols to support retrieving certificates from a
repository are specified in ETSI

section 5.1 of \[[IEEE1609.2](#IEEE1609.2){.xref}\]. In the case of TLS
1.3, and when the certificate_type is 1609.2, the CertificateVerify
contents and processing are different than for the CertificateVerify
message specified for other values of certificate_type in
\[[RFC8446](#RFC8446){.xref}\]. In this case, the CertificateVerify
message contains an Ieee1609Dot2Data encoded with Canonical Octet
Encoding Rules (OER) \[[ITU-TX.696](#ITU-TX.696){.xref}\] of type signed
as specified in \[[IEEE1609.2](#IEEE1609.2){.xref}\] and
\[[IEEE1609.2b](#IEEE1609.2b){.xref}\],
where:[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

-   [payload contains an extDataHash containing the SHA-256 hash of the
    data that the signature is calculated over. This is identical to the
    data that the signature is calculated over in standard TLS, which is
    reproduced below for
    clarity.[¶](#section-5-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-5-2.1}
-   [headerInfo.psid indicates the application activity that the
    certificate is
    authorizing.[¶](#section-5-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-5-2.2}
-   [headerInfo.generationTime is the time at which the data structure
    was generated.[¶](#section-5-2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-5-2.3}
-   [headerInfo.pduFunctionalType (as specified in
    \[[IEEE1609.2b](#IEEE1609.2b){.xref}\]) is present and is set equal
    to tlsHandshake (1).[¶](#section-5-2.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-5-2.4}

All other fields in the headerInfo are omitted. The certificate
appPermissions field [SHALL]{.bcp14} be present and [SHALL]{.bcp14}
permit (as defined in \[[IEEE1609.2](#IEEE1609.2){.xref}\]) signing of
PDUs with the PSID indicated in the HeaderInfo of the SignedData. If the
application specification for that PSID requires Service Specific
Permissions (SSP) for signing a pduFunctionalType of tlsHandshake, this
SSP [SHALL]{.bcp14} also be present. For more details on the use of PSID
and SSP, see \[[IEEE1609.2](#IEEE1609.2){.xref}\], clauses 5.1.1 and
5.2.3.3.3. All other fields in the headerInfo are
omitted.[¶](#section-5-3){.pilcrow}

The certificate appPermissions field [SHALL]{.bcp14} be present and
[SHALL]{.bcp14} permit (as defined in
\[[IEEE1609.2](#IEEE1609.2){.xref}\]) signing of PDUs with the PSID

specification for that PSID requires Service Specific Permissions (SSP)
for signing a pduFunctionalType of tlsHandshake, this SSP
[SHALL]{.bcp14} also be present.[¶](#section-5-4){.pilcrow}

The signature and verification are carried out as specified in
\[[IEEE1609.2](#IEEE1609.2){.xref}\].[¶](#section-5-5){.pilcrow}

The input to the hash process is identical to the message input for TLS
1.3, as specified in [Section
4.4.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8446#section-4.4.3){.relref} of
\[[RFC8446](#RFC8446){.xref}\], consisting of pad, context string,

Conventions around certificate lifetime differ between ITS certificates

relatively short lived compared with typical X.509 certificates. A party
to a TLS session that accepts ITS certificates [MUST]{.bcp14} check the

terminate a session when the certificate received in the handshake

All ITS certificates use public-key cryptographic algorithms with an
estimated strength on the order of 128 bits or more, specifically,
Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) based on curves with keys of length
256 bits or longer. An implementation of the techniques specified in
this document [SHOULD]{.bcp14} require that if X.509 certificates are
used by one of the parties to the session, those certificates are
associated with cryptographic algorithms with (pre-quantum-computer)
strength of at least 128 bits.[¶](#section-7.3-1){.pilcrow}

### [7.4.](#section-7.4){.section-number .selfRef} [Interpreting ITS Certificate Permissions](#name-interpreting-its-certificat){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-interpreting-its-certificat}

ITS certificates in TLS express the certificate holders permissions
using two fields: a PSID, also known as an ITS Application Identifier
(ITS-AID), which identifies a broad set of application activities that
provide a context for the certificate holder\'s permissions, and a
Service Specific Permissions (SSP) field associated with that PSID,
which identifies which specific application activities the certificate
holder is entitled to carry out within the broad set of activities
identified by that PSID. For example, SAE
\[[SAEJ29453](#SAEJ29453){.xref}\] uses PSID 0204099 to indicate
activities around reporting weather and managing weather response
activities, and an SSP that states whether the certificate holder is a
Weather Data Management System (WDMS, i.e., a central road manager), an
ordinary vehicle, or a vehicle belonging to a managed road maintenance
fleet. For more information about PSIDs, see
\[[IEEE1609.12](#IEEE1609.12){.xref}\], and for more information about
the development of SSPs, see

The CertificateVerify message for TLS 1.3 is an Ieee1609Dot2Data of type
signed, where the signature contained in this Ieee1609Dot2Data was
generated using an ITS certificate. This certificate may include
multiple PSIDs. When a CertificateVerify message of this form is used,
the HeaderInfo within the Ieee1609Dot2Data [MUST]{.bcp14} have the
pduFunctionalType field present and set to tlsHandshake. The background
to this requirement is as follows: an ITS certificate may (depending on
the definition of the application associated with its PSID(s)) be used
to directly sign messages or to sign TLS CertificateVerify messages, or
both. To prevent the possibility that a signature generated in one
context could be replayed in a different context, i.e., that a message
signature could be replayed as a CertificateVerify, or vice versa, the
pduFunctionalType field provides a statement of intent by the signer as
to the intended use of the signed message. If the pduFunctionalType
field is absent, the message is a directly signed message for the
application and [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be interpreted as a
CertificateVerify.[¶](#section-7.5-1){.pilcrow}

Note that each PSID is owned by an owning organization that has sole
rights to define activities associated with that PSID. If an application
specifier wishes to expand activities associated with an existing PSID
(for example, to include activities over a secure session such as
specified in this document), that application specifier must negotiate
with the PSID owner to have that functionality added to the official
specification of activities associated with that
PSID.[¶](#section-7.5-2){.pilcrow}
