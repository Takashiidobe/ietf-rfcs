# DNS Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) Resource Record {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

The Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) DNS Resource Record
allows a DNS domain name holder to specify one or more Certification
Authorities (CAs) authorized to issue certificates for that domain name.
CAA Resource Records allow a public CA to implement additional controls
to reduce the risk of unintended certificate mis-issue. This document
defines the syntax of the CAA record and rules for processing CAA
records by CAs.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

This document obsoletes RFC 6844.[¶](#section-abstract-2){.pilcrow}

The Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) DNS Resource Record
allows a DNS domain name holder to specify the Certification Authorities
(CAs) authorized to issue certificates for that domain name. Publication
of CAA Resource Records allows a public CA to implement additional
controls to reduce the risk of unintended certificate
mis-issue.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

Like the TLSA record defined in DNS-Based Authentication of Named
Entities (DANE) \[[RFC6698](#RFC6698){.xref}\], CAA records are used as
a part of a mechanism for checking PKIX \[[RFC6698](#RFC6698){.xref}\]
certificate data. The distinction between CAA and TLSA is that CAA
records specify an authorization control to be performed by a CA before
issuing a certificate and TLSA records specify a verification control to
be performed by a Relying Party after the certificate is
issued.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

Conformance with a published CAA record is a necessary, but not
sufficient, condition for the issuance of a
certificate.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

Criteria for the inclusion of embedded trust anchor certificates in
applications are outside the scope of this document. Typically, such
criteria require the CA to publish a Certification Practices Statement
(CPS) that specifies how the requirements of the Certificate Policy (CP)
are achieved. It is also common for a CA to engage an independent
third-party auditor to prepare an annual audit statement of its
performance against its CPS.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

A set of CAA records describes only current grants of authority to issue
certificates for the corresponding DNS domain name. Since certificates
are valid for a period of time, it is possible that a certificate that
is not conformant with the CAA records currently published was
conformant with the CAA records published at the time that the
certificate was issued. Relying Parties [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} use CAA
records as part of certificate validation.[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}

CAA records [MAY]{.bcp14} be used by Certificate Evaluators as a
possible indicator of a security policy violation. Such use
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} take into account the possibility that published CAA
records changed between the time a certificate was issued and the time
at which the certificate was observed by the Certificate
Evaluator.[¶](#section-1-6){.pilcrow}

Before issuing a certificate, a compliant CA [MUST]{.bcp14} check for
publication of a Relevant RRset. If such an RRset exists, a CA
[MUST NOT]{.bcp14} issue a certificate unless the CA determines that
either (1) the certificate request is consistent with the applicable CAA
RRset or (2) an exception specified in the relevant CP or CPS applies.
If the Relevant RRset for an FQDN or Wildcard Domain Name contains no
Property Tags that restrict issuance (for instance, if it contains only
iodef Property Tags or only Property Tags unrecognized by the CA), CAA
does not restrict issuance.[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

A certificate request [MAY]{.bcp14} specify more than one FQDN and

The use of DNSSEC to authenticate CAA RRs is strongly

DNSSEC provides a proof of non-existence for both DNS FQDNs and RRsets

whether the answer to a CAA record query (1) is empty because the RRset
is empty or (2) is non-empty but the response has been
suppressed.[¶](#section-5.1-2){.pilcrow}

The use of DNSSEC allows an Issuer to acquire and archive a proof that
they were authorized to issue certificates for the FQDN. Verification of

Queries for CAA RRs are different from most DNS RR types, because a
signed, empty response to a query for CAA RRs is meaningfully different
from a bogus response. A signed, empty response indicates that there is
definitely no CAA policy set at a given label. A bogus response may mean
either a misconfigured zone or an attacker tampering with records.
DNSSEC implementations may have bugs with signatures on empty responses
that go unnoticed, because for more common RR types like A and AAAA, the
difference to an end user between empty and bogus is irrelevant; they
both mean a site is unavailable.[¶](#section-6.4-1){.pilcrow}

In particular, at least two authoritative resolvers that implement live
signing had bugs when returning empty RRsets for DNSSEC-signed zones, in
combination with mixed-case queries. Mixed‑case queries, also known as
DNS 0x20, are used by some recursive resolvers to increase resilience
against DNS poisoning attacks. DNSSEC-signing authoritative resolvers
are expected to copy the same capitalization from the query into their
ANSWER section but also to sign the response as if they had used all
lowercase. In particular, PowerDNS versions prior to 4.0.4 had this
bug.[¶](#section-6.4-2){.pilcrow}

gained with practical deployment of CAA enforcement among CAs in the
WebPKI.[¶](#section-7-2){.pilcrow}

This document clarifies the ABNF grammar for the issue and issuewild
tags and resolves some inconsistencies with the document text. In
particular, it specifies that parameters are separated with semicolons.
It also allows hyphens in Property Tags.[¶](#section-7-3){.pilcrow}

This document also clarifies the processing of a CAA RRset that is not
empty but that does not contain any issue or issuewild
tags.[¶](#section-7-4){.pilcrow}

This document removes the section titled \"The CAA RR Type,\" merging it
with \"Mechanism\" ([Section 4](#mechanism){.xref}) because the
definitions were mainly duplicates. It moves the \"Use of DNS Security\"
section into Security Considerations ([Section
5](#security-considerations){.xref}). It renames \"Certification
Authority Processing\" to \"Relevant Resource Record Set\" ([Section
3](#relevant-resource-record-set){.xref}) and emphasizes the use of that
term to more clearly define which domains are affected by a given
RRset.[¶](#section-7-5){.pilcrow}
