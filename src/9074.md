The [iCalendar specification](#RFC5545){.xref}
\[[RFC5545](#RFC5545){.xref}\] defines a set of components used to
describe calendar data. One of those is the \"VALARM\" component, which
appears as a subcomponent of the \"VEVENT\" and \"VTODO\" components.
The \"VALARM\" component is used to specify a reminder for an event or
task. Different alarm actions are possible, as are different ways to
specify how the alarm is triggered.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

As iCalendar has become more widely used and as client-server protocols,
such as [Calendaring Extensions to WebDAV (CalDAV)](#RFC4791){.xref}
\[[RFC4791](#RFC4791){.xref}\], have become more prevalent, several
issues with \"VALARM\" components have arisen. Most of these relate to
the need to extend the existing \"VALARM\" component with new properties
and behaviors to allow clients and servers to accomplish specific tasks
in an interoperable manner. For example, clients typically need a way to
specify that an alarm has been dismissed by a calendar user or has been
\"snoozed\" by a set amount of time. To date, this has been done through
the use of custom \"X-\" properties specific to each client
implementation, leading to poor
interoperability.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

This specification defines a set of extensions to \"VALARM\" components
to cover common requirements for alarms not currently addressed in
iCalendar. Each extension is defined in a separate section below. For
the most part, each extension can be supported independently of the
others; though, in some cases, one extension will require another. In
addition, this specification describes mechanisms by which clients can
interoperably implement common features, such as
\"snoozing\".[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC8174](#RFC8174){.xref}\] when, and only when, they appear in all
capitals, as shown here.[¶](#section-2-1){.pilcrow}

The notation used in this memo to (re-)define iCalendar elements is the
ABNF notation of \[[RFC5234](#RFC5234){.xref}\] as used by
\[[RFC5545](#RFC5545){.xref}\]. Any syntax elements shown below that are
not explicitly defined in this specification come from iCalendar
\[[RFC5545](#RFC5545){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2-2){.pilcrow}

When XML element types in the namespaces \"DAV:\" and
\"urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:caldav\" are referenced in this document
outside of the context of an XML fragment, the string \"DAV:\" and
\"CALDAV:\" will be prefixed to the element type names,
respectively.[¶](#section-2-3){.pilcrow}

[Section
3.6.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5545#section-3.6.6){.relref} of
\[[RFC5545](#RFC5545){.xref}\] defines the syntax for \"VALARM\"
components and properties within them. However, as written, it is hard
to extend this, e.g., by adding a new property common to all types of
alarms. Since many of the extensions defined in this document need to
extend the base syntax, an alternative form for the base syntax is
defined here, with the goal of simplifying specification of the
extensions while augmenting the existing functionality defined in
\[[RFC5545](#RFC5545){.xref}\] to allow for nested subcomponents (as
required by [proximity alarm triggers](#proximity){.xref} ([Section
8](#proximity){.xref})).[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

This extension adds a \"UID\" property to \"VALARM\" components to allow
a unique identifier to be specified. The value of this property can then
be used to refer uniquely to the \"VALARM\"
component.[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

The \"UID\" property defined here follows the definition in [Section

## [5.](#section-5){.section-number .selfRef} [Alarm Related To](#name-alarm-related-to){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-alarm-related-to}

It is often convenient to relate one or more \"VALARM\" components to
other \"VALARM\" components (e.g., see [Section 7](#snooze){.xref}).
This can be accomplished if the \"VALARM\" components each have their
own \"UID\" property (as per [Section
4](#uid){.xref}).[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

This specification updates the usage of the \"RELATED-TO\" property
defined in [Section
3.8.4.5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5545#section-3.8.4.5){.relref}
of \[[RFC5545](#RFC5545){.xref}\] to enable its use with \"VALARM\"
components. Specific types of relationships between \"VALARM\"
components can be identified by registering new values for the
\"RELTYPE\" property parameter defined in [Section
3.2.15](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5545#section-3.2.15){.relref}
of \[[RFC5545](#RFC5545){.xref}\].[¶](#section-5-2){.pilcrow}

## [6.](#section-6){.section-number .selfRef} [Alarm Acknowledgement](#name-alarm-acknowledgement){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-alarm-acknowledgement}

There is currently no way for a \"VALARM\" component to indicate whether
it has been triggered and acknowledged. With the advent of a standard
client/server protocol for calendaring and scheduling data
(\[[RFC4791](#RFC4791){.xref}\]), it is quite possible for an event with
an alarm to exist on multiple clients in addition to the server. If each
of those is responsible for performing the action when an alarm
triggers, then multiple \"alerts\" are generated by different devices.
In such a situation, a calendar user would like to be able to
\"dismiss\" the alarm on one device and have it automatically dismissed
on the others, too.[¶](#section-6-1){.pilcrow}

Also, with recurring events that have alarms, it is important to know
when the last alarm in the recurring set was acknowledged so that the
client can determine whether past alarms have been
missed.[¶](#section-6-2){.pilcrow}

To address these needs, this specification adds an \"ACKNOWLEDGED\"
property to \"VALARM\" components to indicate when the alarm was last
acknowledged (or sent, if acknowledgement is not possible). This is
defined by the syntax below.[¶](#section-6-3){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-6-4}
``` {.sourcecode .lang-abnf}
alarmprop       =/ (
                   ;

Property Name:
:   ACKNOWLEDGED[¶](#section-6.1-1.2){.pilcrow}
:   

Purpose:
:   This property specifies the UTC date and time at which the
    corresponding alarm was last sent or
    acknowledged.[¶](#section-6.1-1.4){.pilcrow}
:   

Value Type:
:   DATE-TIME[¶](#section-6.1-1.6){.pilcrow}
:   

Property Parameters:
:   IANA and nonstandard property parameters can be specified on this
    property.[¶](#section-6.1-1.8){.pilcrow}
:   

Conformance:
:   This property can be specified within \"VALARM\" calendar
    components.[¶](#section-6.1-1.10){.pilcrow}
:   

Description:

:   This property is used to specify when an alarm was last sent or
    acknowledged. This allows clients to determine when a pending alarm
    has been acknowledged by a calendar user so that any alerts can be
    dismissed across multiple devices. It also allows clients to track
    repeating alarms or alarms on recurring events or to-dos to ensure
    that the right number of missed alarms can be
    tracked.[¶](#section-6.1-1.12.1){.pilcrow}

    Clients [SHOULD]{.bcp14} set this property to the current date-time
    value in UTC when a calendar user acknowledges a pending alarm.
    Certain kinds of alarms, such as email-based alerts, might not
    provide feedback as to when the calendar user sees them. For those
    kinds of alarms, the client [SHOULD]{.bcp14} set this property when
    the alarm is triggered and the action is successfully carried
    out.[¶](#section-6.1-1.12.2){.pilcrow}

    When an alarm is triggered on a client, clients can check to see if
    an \"ACKNOWLEDGED\" property is present. If it is, and the value of
    that property is greater than or equal to the computed trigger time
    for the alarm, then the client [SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} trigger the
    alarm. Similarly, if an alarm has been triggered and an \"alert\"
    has been presented to a calendar user, clients can monitor the
    iCalendar data to determine whether an \"ACKNOWLEDGED\" property is
    added or changed in the alarm component. If the value of any
    \"ACKNOWLEDGED\" property in the alarm changes and is greater than
    or equal to the trigger time of the alarm, then clients
    [SHOULD]{.bcp14} dismiss or cancel any \"alert\" presented to the
    calendar user.[¶](#section-6.1-1.12.3){.pilcrow}

Typically, when a \"PROXIMITY\" property is used, there is no need to
specify a time-based trigger using the \"TRIGGER\" property. However,
since \"TRIGGER\" is defined as a required property for a \"VALARM\"
component, for backwards compatibility, it has to be present but
ignored. To indicate a \"TRIGGER\" that is to be ignored, clients
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} use a value a long time in the past. A value of
\"19760401T005545Z\" has been commonly used for this

    trigger. Its value identifies the action that will trigger the
    alarm.[¶](#section-8.1-1.12.1){.pilcrow}

    When the property value is set to \"ARRIVE\", the alarm is triggered
    when the calendar user agent arrives in the vicinity of one or more
    locations. When set to \"DEPART\", the alarm is triggered when the
    calendar user agent departs from the vicinity of one or more
    locations. Each location [MUST]{.bcp14} be specified with a
    \"VLOCATION\" component. Note that the meaning of \"vicinity\" in
    this context is implementation
    defined.[¶](#section-8.1-1.12.2){.pilcrow}

    When the property value is set to \"CONNECT\", the alarm is
    triggered when the calendar user agent connects to an automobile to
    which it has been paired via [Bluetooth](#BTcore){.xref}
    \[[BTcore](#BTcore){.xref}\]. When set to \"DISCONNECT\", the alarm

In addition to the security properties of iCalendar (see [Section
7](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5545#section-7){.relref} of
\[[RFC5545](#RFC5545){.xref}\]), a \"VALARM\", if not monitored
properly, can be used to disturb users and/or leak personal information.
For instance, an undesirable audio alert could cause embarrassment; an
unwanted display alert could be considered an annoyance; or an email
alert could be used to leak a user\'s location to a third party or to
send unsolicited email to multiple users. Therefore, CalDAV clients and
servers that accept iCalendar data from a third party (e.g., via
iCalendar Transport-Independent Interoperability Protocol (iTIP)
\[[RFC5546](#RFC5546){.xref}\], a subscription feed, or a shared
calendar) [SHOULD]{.bcp14} remove each \"VALARM\" from the data prior to
storing in their calendar system.[¶](#section-9-1){.pilcrow}

## [10.](#section-10){.section-number .selfRef} [Privacy Considerations](#name-privacy-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-privacy-considerations}

A proximity \"VALARM\", if not used carefully, can leak a user\'s past,
present, or future location. For instance, storing an iCalendar resource
containing proximity \"VALARM\"s to a shared calendar on CalDAV server
can expose to anyone that has access to that calendar the user\'s intent
to leave from or arrive at a particular location at some future time.
Furthermore, if a CalDAV client updates the shared iCalendar resource
with an \"ACKNOWLEDGED\" property when the alarm is triggered, this will
leak the exact date and time that the user left from or arrived at the
location. Therefore, CalDAV clients that implement proximity alarms
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} give users the option of storing and/or acknowledging
the alarms on the local device only and not storing the alarm and/or
acknowledgement on a remote server.[¶](#section-10-1){.pilcrow}
