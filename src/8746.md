# RFC 8746 {#rfcnum}

# Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) Tags for Typed Arrays {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR), as defined in RFC 7049,
is a data format whose design goals include the possibility of extremely
small code size, fairly small message size, and extensibility without
the need for version negotiation.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

This document makes use of this extensibility to define a number of CBOR
tags for typed arrays of numeric data, as well as additional tags for
multi-dimensional and homogeneous arrays. It is intended as the
reference document for the IANA registration of the CBOR tags
defined.[¶](#section-abstract-2){.pilcrow}

The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR)
\[[RFC7049](#RFC7049){.xref}\] provides for the interchange of
structured data without a requirement for a pre-agreed schema.
\[[RFC7049](#RFC7049){.xref}\] defines a basic set of data types as well
as a tagging mechanism that enables extending the set of data types
supported via an IANA registry.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

Recently, a simple form of typed arrays of numeric data has received
interest both in the Web graphics community
\[[TypedArray](#TypedArray){.xref}\] and in the JavaScript specification
(see [Section
22.2](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/10.0/index.html#sec-typedarray-objects)
of \[[ECMA-ES10](#ECMA-ES10){.xref}\]) as well as in corresponding
implementations
\[[ArrayBuffer](#ArrayBuffer){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

Since these typed arrays may carry significant amounts of data, there is
interest in interchanging them in CBOR without the need of lengthy
conversion of each number in the array. This can also save space
overhead with encoding a type for each element of an
array.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

This document defines a number of interrelated CBOR tags that cover
these typed arrays, as well as additional tags for multi-dimensional and
homogeneous arrays. It is intended as the reference document for the
IANA registration of the tags defined.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

Note that an application that generates CBOR with these tags has
considerable freedom in choosing variants (e.g., with respect to
endianness, embedded type (signed vs. unsigned), and number of bits per
element) or whether a tag defined in this specification is used at all
instead of more basic CBOR. In contrast to representation variants of
single CBOR numbers, there is no representation that could be identified
as \"preferred\". If deterministic encoding is desired in a CBOR-based
protocol making use of these tags, the protocol has to define which of
the encoding variants are used for each individual
case.[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}

The key words \"[MUST]{.bcp14}\", \"[MUST NOT]{.bcp14}\",
\"[REQUIRED]{.bcp14}\", \"[SHALL]{.bcp14}\", \"[SHALL NOT]{.bcp14}\",
\"[SHOULD]{.bcp14}\", \"[SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14}\",
\"[RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14}\", \"[NOT RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14}\",
\"[MAY]{.bcp14}\", and \"[OPTIONAL]{.bcp14}\" in this document are to be

\[[RFC8174](#RFC8174){.xref}\] when, and only when, they appear in all
capitals, as shown here.[¶](#section-1.1-1){.pilcrow}

The term \"byte\" is used in its now-customary sense as a synonym for
\"octet\". Where bit arithmetic is explained, this document uses
familiar notation from the programming language C \[[C](#C){.xref}\]
(including C++14\'s 0bnnn binary literals
\[[CPlusPlus](#CPlusPlus){.xref}\]) with the exception of the operator
\"\*\*\", which stands for exponentiation.[¶](#section-1.1-2){.pilcrow}

The term \"array\" is used in a general sense in this document unless
further specified. The term \"classical CBOR array\" describes an array
represented with CBOR major type 4. A \"homogeneous array\" is an array
of elements that are all the same type (the term is neutral as to
whether that is a representation type or an application data model
type).[¶](#section-1.1-3){.pilcrow}

The terms \"big endian\" and \"little endian\" are used to indicate a
most significant byte first (MSB first) representation of integers and a
least significant byte first (LSB first) representation,
respectively.[¶](#section-1.1-4){.pilcrow}

## [2.](#section-2){.section-number .selfRef} [Typed Arrays](#name-typed-arrays){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-typed-arrays}

Typed arrays are homogeneous arrays of numbers, all of which are encoded
in a single form of binary representation. The concatenation of these
representations is encoded as a single CBOR byte string (major type 2),
enclosed by a single tag indicating the type and encoding of all the
numbers represented in the byte string.[¶](#section-2-1){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-2.1 .section}
### [2.1.](#section-2.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Types of Numbers](#name-types-of-numbers){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-types-of-numbers}

Three classes of numbers are of interest: unsigned integers (uint),
signed integers (two\'s complement, sint), and IEEE 754 binary floating
point numbers (which are always signed). For each of these classes,
there are multiple representation lengths in active
use:[¶](#section-2.1-1){.pilcrow}

[]{#name-length-values}

::: {#lengths}
  Length ll   uint     sint     float
  ----------- -------- -------- -----------
  0           uint8    sint8    binary16
  1           uint16   sint16   binary32
  2           uint32   sint32   binary64
  3           uint64   sint64   binary128

  : [Table 1](#table-1){.selfRef}: [Length
  Values](#name-length-values){.selfRef}
:::

Here, sintN stands for a signed integer of exactly N bits (for instance,
sint16), and uintN stands for an unsigned integer of exactly N bits (for
instance, uint32). The name binaryN stands for the number form of the
same name defined in IEEE 754
\[[IEEE754](#IEEE754){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2.1-3){.pilcrow}

Since one objective of these tags is to be able to directly ship the
ArrayBuffers underlying the Typed Arrays without re-encoding them, and
these may be either in big-endian (network byte order) or in
little-endian form, we need to define tags for both
variants.[¶](#section-2.1-4){.pilcrow}

In total, this leads to 24 variants. In the tag, we need to express the
choice between integer and floating point, the signedness (for
integers), the endianness, and one of the four length
values.[¶](#section-2.1-5){.pilcrow}

In order to simplify implementation, a range of tags is being allocated
that allows retrieving all this information from the bits of the tag:
tag values from 64 to 87.[¶](#section-2.1-6){.pilcrow}

The value is split up into 5 bit fields: 0b010, f, s, e, and ll as
detailed in [Table 2](#fields){.xref}.[¶](#section-2.1-7){.pilcrow}

[]{#name-bit-fields-in-the-low-8-bit}

::: {#fields}
  Field   Use
  ------- -------------------------------------------------------
  0b010   the constant bits 0, 1, 0
  f       0 for integer, 1 for float
  s       0 for float or unsigned integer, 1 for signed integer
  e       0 for big endian, 1 for little endian
  ll      A number for the length ([Table 1](#lengths){.xref}).

  : [Table 2](#table-2){.selfRef}: [Bit Fields in the Low 8 Bits of the
  Tag](#name-bit-fields-in-the-low-8-bit){.selfRef}
:::

The number of bytes in each array element can then be calculated by
`2**(f + ll)` (or `1 << (f + ll)` in a typical programming language).
(Notice that 0f and ll are the two least significant bits, respectively,
of each 4-bit nibble in the byte.)[¶](#section-2.1-9){.pilcrow}

In the CBOR representation, the total number of elements in the array is
not expressed explicitly but is implied from the length of the byte
string and the length of each representation. It can be computed from
the length, in bytes, of the byte string comprising the representation
of the array by inverting the previous formula:
`bytelength >> (f + ll)`.[¶](#section-2.1-10){.pilcrow}

For the uint8/sint8 values, the endianness is redundant. Only the tag
for the big-endian variant is used and assigned as such. The tag that
would signify the little-endian variant of sint8 [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be
used; its tag number is marked as reserved. As a special case, the tag
that would signify the little-endian variant of uint8 is instead
assigned to signify that the numbers in the array are using clamped
conversion from integers, as described in more detail in
[Section 7.1.11](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-touint8clamp)
of the ES10 JavaScript specification (`ToUint8Clamp`)
\[[ECMA-ES10](#ECMA-ES10){.xref}\]; the assumption here is that a
program-internal representation of this array after decoding would be
marked this way for further processing providing \"roundtripping\" of
JavaScript-typed arrays through CBOR.[¶](#section-2.1-11){.pilcrow}

IEEE 754 binary floating numbers are always signed. Therefore, for the
float variants (`f` == 1), there is no need to distinguish between
signed and unsigned variants; the `s` bit is always zero. The tag
numbers where `s` would be one (which would have tag values 88 to 95)
remain free to use by other
specifications.[¶](#section-2.1-12){.pilcrow}

This specification defines three additional array tags. The
Multi-dimensional Array tags can be combined with classical CBOR arrays
as well as with Typed Arrays in order to build multi-dimensional arrays
with constant numbers of elements in the sub-arrays. The Homogeneous
Array tag can be used as a signal by an application to identify a
classical CBOR array as a homogeneous array, even when a Typed Array
does not apply.[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

### [3.1.](#section-3.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Multi-dimensional Array](#name-multi-dimensional-array){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-multi-dimensional-array}

A multi-dimensional array is represented as a tagged array that contains
two (one-dimensional) arrays. The first array defines the dimensions of
the multi-dimensional array (in the sequence of outer dimensions towards
inner dimensions) while the second array represents the contents of the
multi-dimensional array. If the second array is itself tagged as a Typed
Array, then the element type of the multi-dimensional array is known to
be the same type as that of the Typed
Array.[¶](#section-3.1-1){.pilcrow}

Two tags are defined by this document: one for elements arranged in
row-major order and another for column-major order
\[[RowColMajor](#RowColMajor){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3.1-2){.pilcrow}

    Homogeneous Array) of elements.[¶](#section-3.1.1-1.4){.pilcrow}

Data in the second array consists of consecutive values where the last
dimension is considered contiguous (row-major
order).[¶](#section-3.1.1-2){.pilcrow}

Data Item:
:   Array (major type 4)[¶](#section-3.2-1.4){.pilcrow}

This tag identifies the classical CBOR array (a one-dimensional array)
tagged by it as a homogeneous array, that is, it has elements that are
all of the same application model data type. The element type of the
array is therefore determined by the application model data type of the
first array element.[¶](#section-3.2-2){.pilcrow}

This can be used in application data models that apply specific
semantics to homogeneous arrays. Also, in certain cases, implementations
in strongly typed languages may be able to create native homogeneous
arrays of specific types instead of ordered lists while decoding. Which
CBOR data items constitute elements of the same application type is
specific to the application.[¶](#section-3.2-3){.pilcrow}

Support for both little- and big-endian representation may seem out of
character with CBOR, which is otherwise fully big endian. This support
is in line with the intended use of the typed arrays and the objective
not to require conversion of each array
element.[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

This specification allocates a sizable chunk out of the single-byte tag
space. This use of code point space is justified by the wide use of
typed arrays in data interchange.[¶](#section-4-2){.pilcrow}

Providing a column-major order variant of the multi-dimensional array
may seem superfluous to some and useful to others. It is cheap to define
the additional tag so that it is available when actually needed.
Allocating it out of a different number space makes the preference for
row-major evident.[¶](#section-4-3){.pilcrow}

Applying a Homogeneous Array tag to a Typed Array would usually be
redundant and is therefore not provided by the present
specification.[¶](#section-4-4){.pilcrow}

The security considerations of \[[RFC7049](#RFC7049){.xref}\] apply;
special attention is drawn to the second paragraph of [Section
8](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7049#section-8){.relref} of
\[[RFC7049](#RFC7049){.xref}\].[¶](#section-7-1){.pilcrow}

The tag for homogeneous arrays makes a promise about its tagged data
item, which a maliciously constructed CBOR input can then choose to
ignore. As always, the decoder therefore has to ensure that it is not
driven into an undefined state by array elements that do not fulfill the
promise, and that it does continue to fulfill its API contract in this
case as well.[¶](#section-7-2){.pilcrow}

As with all formats that are used for data interchange, an attacker may
have control over the shape of the data delivered as input to the
application, which therefore needs to validate that shape before it
makes it the basis of its further processing. One unique aspect that
typed arrays add to this is that an attacker might substitute a
Uint8ClampedArray for where the application expects a Uint8Array, or
vice versa, potentially leading to very different (and unexpected)
processing semantics of the in-memory data structures constructed.
Applications that could be affected by this will therefore need to be
careful about making this distinction in their input
validation.[¶](#section-7-3){.pilcrow}
