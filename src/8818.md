# Distributed Mobility Anchoring {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

This document defines distributed mobility anchoring in terms of the
different configurations and functions to provide IP mobility support. A
network may be configured with distributed mobility anchoring functions
for both network-based or host-based mobility support, depending on the
network\'s needs. In a distributed mobility anchoring environment,
multiple anchors are available for mid-session switching of an IP prefix
anchor. To start a new flow or to handle a flow not requiring IP session
continuity as a mobile node moves to a new network, the flow can be
started or restarted using an IP address configured from the new IP
prefix anchored to the new network. If the flow needs to survive the
change of network, there are solutions that can be used to enable IP
address mobility. This document describes different anchoring
approaches, depending on the IP mobility needs, and how this IP address
mobility is handled by the network.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

A key requirement in distributed mobility management (DMM)
\[[RFC7333](#RFC7333){.xref}\] is to enable traffic to avoid traversing
a single mobility anchor far from an optimal route. This document
defines different configurations, functional operations, and parameters
for distributed mobility anchoring and explains how to use them to avoid
unnecessarily long routes when a mobile node
moves.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

Other distributed mobility management documents already address source
address selection \[[RFC8653](#RFC8653){.xref}\] and control-plane and
data-plane signaling
\[[FPC-DMM-PROTOCOL](#I-D.ietf-dmm-fpc-cpdp){.xref}\]. A number of
distributed mobility solutions have also been proposed, for example, in
\[[DMM-DMA](#I-D.seite-dmm-dma){.xref}\],
\[[RFC8885](#RFC8885){.xref}\],
\[[DMM-WIFI](#I-D.sarikaya-dmm-for-wifi){.xref}\],
\[[DMM-ENHANCED-ANCHORING](#I-D.yhkim-dmm-enhanced-anchoring){.xref}\],
and
\[[STATELESS-UPLANE-VEPC](#I-D.matsushima-stateless-uplane-vepc){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

Distributed mobility anchoring employs multiple anchors in the data
plane. In general, control-plane functions may be separated from
data-plane functions and be centralized but may also be co-located with
the data-plane functions at the distributed anchors. Different
configurations of distributed mobility anchoring are described in
[Section
3.1](#sec_distributed-anchoring-configurations){.xref}.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

As a Mobile Node (MN) attaches to an access router and establishes a
link between them, a /64 IPv6 prefix anchored to the router may be
assigned to the link for exclusive use by the MN
\[[RFC6459](#RFC6459){.xref}\]. The MN may then configure a global IPv6
address from this prefix and use it as the source IP address in a flow
to communicate with its Correspondent Node (CN). When there are multiple
mobility anchors assigned to the same MN, an address selection for a
given flow is first required before the flow is initiated. Using an
anchor in an MN\'s network of attachment has the advantage that the
packets can simply be forwarded according to the forwarding table.
However, after the flow has been initiated, the MN may later move to
another network that assigns a new mobility anchor to the MN. Since the
new anchor is located in a different network, the MN\'s assigned prefix
does not belong to the network where the MN is currently
attached.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

When the MN wants to continue using its assigned prefix to complete
ongoing data sessions after it has moved to a new network, the network
needs to provide support for the MN\'s IP address and session
continuity, since routing packets to the MN through the new network
deviates from applying default routes. The IP session continuity needs
of a flow (application) determine how the IP address used by this flow
has to be anchored. If the ongoing IP flow can cope with an IP
prefix/address change, the flow can be reinitiated with a new IP address
anchored in the new network. On the other hand, if the ongoing IP flow
cannot cope with such change, mobility support is needed. A network
supporting a mix of flows both requiring and not requiring IP mobility
support will need to distinguish these flows.[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}

In addition, this document uses the following terms and
definitions:[¶](#section-2-3){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

IP session continuity:

:   The ability to maintain an ongoing transport interaction by keeping
    the same local endpoint IP address throughout the lifetime of the IP
    socket despite the mobile host changing its point of attachment
    within the IP network topology. The IP address of the host may
    change after closing the IP socket and before opening a new one, but
    that does not jeopardize the ability of applications using these IP
    sockets to work flawlessly. Session continuity is essential for
    mobile hosts to maintain ongoing flows without any interruption
    \[[RFC8653](#RFC8653){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2-4.2.1){.pilcrow}

:   

Higher-layer session continuity:

:   The ability to maintain an ongoing transport- or higher-layer (e.g.,
    application) interaction by keeping the session identifiers
    throughout the lifetime of the session despite the mobile host
    changing its point of attachment within the IP network topology.
    This can be achieved by using mechanisms at the transport or higher
    layers.[¶](#section-2-4.4.1){.pilcrow}

:   

IP address reachability:

:   The ability to maintain the same IP address for an extended period
    of time. The IP address stays the same across independent sessions,
    even in the absence of any session. The IP address may be published
    in a long-term registry (e.g., DNS) and is made available for
    serving incoming (e.g., TCP) connections. IP address reachability is
    essential for mobile hosts to use specific/published IP addresses
    \[[RFC8653](#RFC8653){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2-4.6.1){.pilcrow}

:   

IP mobility:

:   The combination of IP address reachability and session
    continuity.[¶](#section-2-4.8.1){.pilcrow}

:   

Anchoring (of an IP prefix/address):

:   An IP prefix (i.e., Home Network Prefix (HNP)) or address (i.e.,
    HoA) assigned for use by an MN is topologically anchored to an
    anchor node when the anchor node is able to advertise a route into
    the routing infrastructure for the assigned IP prefix. The traffic
    using the assigned IP address/prefix must traverse the anchor node.
    We can refer to the function performed by the IP anchor node as
    anchoring, which is a data-plane
    function.[¶](#section-2-4.10.1){.pilcrow}

:   

Location Management (LM) function:

:   A control-plane function that keeps and manages the network location
    information of an MN. The location information may be a binding of
    the advertised IP address/prefix (e.g., HoA or HNP) to the IP
    routing address of the MN or of a node that can forward packets
    destined to the MN.[¶](#section-2-4.12.1){.pilcrow}

    When the MN is a Mobile Router (MR), the location information will
    also include the Mobile Network Prefix (MNP), which is the aggregate
    IP prefix delegated to the MR to assign IP prefixes for use by the
    Mobile Network Nodes (MNNs) in the mobile
    network.[¶](#section-2-4.12.2){.pilcrow}

    In a client-server protocol model, secure (i.e., authenticated and
    authorized) location query and update messages may be exchanged
    between a Location Management client (LMc) and a Location Management
    server (LMs), where the location information can be updated or
    queried from the LMc. Optionally, there may be a Location Management
    proxy (LMp) between LMc and LMs.[¶](#section-2-4.12.3){.pilcrow}

    With separation of control plane and data plane, the LM function is
    in the control plane. It may be a logical function at the
    control-plane node, control-plane anchor, or mobility
    controller.[¶](#section-2-4.12.4){.pilcrow}

    It may be distributed or
    centralized.[¶](#section-2-4.12.5){.pilcrow}

:   

Forwarding Management (FM) function:

:   Packet interception and forwarding to/from the IP address/prefix
    assigned for use by the MN, based on the internetwork location
    information, either to the destination or to some other network
    element that knows how to forward the packets to their
    destination.[¶](#section-2-4.14.1){.pilcrow}

    This function may be used to achieve traffic indirection. With
    separation of control plane and data plane, the FM function may
    split into an FM function in the data plane (FM-DP) and an FM
    function in the control plane
    (FM-CP).[¶](#section-2-4.14.2){.pilcrow}

    FM-DP may be distributed with distributed mobility management. It
    may be a function in a data-plane anchor or data-plane
    node.[¶](#section-2-4.14.3){.pilcrow}

    FM-CP may be distributed or centralized. It may be a function in a
    control-plane node, control-plane anchor, or mobility
    controller.[¶](#section-2-4.14.4){.pilcrow}

:   

Home Control-Plane Anchor (Home-CPA or H-CPA):

:   The Home-CPA function hosts the MN\'s mobility session. There can be
    more than one mobility session for a mobile node, and those sessions
    may be anchored on the same or different Home-CPA\'s. The Home-CPA
    will interface with the Home-DPA for managing the forwarding
    state.[¶](#section-2-4.16.1){.pilcrow}

:   

Home Data-Plane Anchor (Home-DPA or H-DPA):

:   The Home-DPA is the topological anchor for the MN\'s IP
    address/prefix(es). The Home-DPA is chosen by the Home-CPA on a
    session basis. The Home-DPA is in the forwarding path for all the
    mobile node\'s IP traffic.[¶](#section-2-4.18.1){.pilcrow}

:   

Access Control-Plane Node (Access-CPN or A-CPN):

:   The Access-CPN is responsible for interfacing with the mobile
    node\'s Home-CPA and with the Access-DPN. The Access-CPN has a
    protocol interface to the Home-CPA.[¶](#section-2-4.20.1){.pilcrow}

:   

Access Data-Plane Node (Access-DPN or A-DPN):

:   The Access-DPN function is hosted on the first-hop router where the
    mobile node is attached. This function is not hosted on a Layer 2
    bridging device such as an eNode(B) or Access
    Point.[¶](#section-2-4.22.1){.pilcrow}

client-based distributed mobility management. In this configuration, the
mobile node performs Control-Plane Node (CPN) and Data-Plane Node (DPN)
mobility functions, namely the forwarding management and location

IP mobility support may be provided only when needed instead of being
provided by default. Three cases can be
considered:[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

-   [Nomadic case: No address continuity is required. The IP address
    used by the MN changes after a movement and traffic using the old
    address is disrupted. If session continuity is required, then it
    needs to be provided by a solution running at Layer 4 or
    above.[¶](#section-4-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-4-2.1}
-   [Mobility case with traffic redirection: Address continuity is
    required. When the MN moves, the previous anchor still anchors the
    traffic using the old IP address and forwards it to the new MN\'s
    location. The MN obtains a new IP address anchored to the new
    location and preferably uses it for new communications established
    while connected at the new
    location.[¶](#section-4-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-4-2.2}
-   [Mobility case with anchor relocation: Address continuity is
    required. In this case, the route followed by the traffic is
    optimized by using some means for traffic indirection to deviate
    from default routes.[¶](#section-4-2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-4-2.3}

A straightforward choice of mobility anchoring is the following: the MN
chooses, as a source IP address for packets belonging to an IP flow, an
address allocated by the network the MN is attached to when the flow was
initiated. As such, traffic belonging to this flow traverses the MN\'s
mobility anchor \[[DMM-DMA](#I-D.seite-dmm-dma){.xref}\]
\[[RFC8885](#RFC8885){.xref}\].[¶](#section-4-3){.pilcrow}

The IP prefix/address at the MN\'s side of a flow may be anchored to the
Access Router (AR) to which the MN is attached. For example, when an MN
attaches to a network (Net1) or moves to a new network (Net2), an IP
prefix from the attached network is assigned to the MN\'s interface. In
addition to configuring new link-local addresses, the MN configures from
this prefix an IP address that is typically a dynamic IP address
(meaning that this address is only used while the MN is attached to this
access router, so the IP address configured by the MN dynamically
changes when attaching to a different access network). It then uses this
IP address when a flow is initiated. Packets from this flow addressed to
the MN are simply forwarded according to the forwarding
table.[¶](#section-4-4){.pilcrow}

There may be multiple IP prefixes/addresses that an MN can select when
initiating a flow. They may be from the same access network or different
access networks. The network may advertise these prefixes with cost
options \[[PREFIX-COST](#I-D.mccann-dmm-prefixcost){.xref}\] so that the
mobile node may choose the one with the least cost. In addition, the IP
prefixes/addresses provided by the network may be of different types
regarding whether mobility support is supported
\[[RFC8653](#RFC8653){.xref}\]. An MN will need to choose which IP
prefix/address to use for each flow according to whether or not it needs
IP mobility support, for example, using the mechanisms described in
\[[RFC8653](#RFC8653){.xref}\].[¶](#section-4-5){.pilcrow}

:::

When there is no need to provide IP mobility to a flow, the flow may use
a new IP address acquired from a new network as the MN moves to the new
network.[¶](#section-4.1-3){.pilcrow}

Regardless of whether or not IP mobility is needed, if the flow has not
terminated before the MN moves to a new network, the flow may
subsequently restart using the new IP address assigned from the new
network.[¶](#section-4.1-4){.pilcrow}

When IP session continuity is needed, even if an application flow is
ongoing as the MN moves, it may still be desirable for the application
flow to change to using the new IP prefix configured in the new network.
The application flow may then be closed at the IP level and then be
restarted using a new IP address configured in the new network. Such a
change in the IP address used by the application flow may be enabled
using a higher-layer mobility support that is not in the scope of this
document.[¶](#section-4.1-5){.pilcrow}

In [Figure 3](#fig_change-net){.xref}, a flow initiated while the MN was
using the IP prefix IP1, anchored to a previous access router AR1 in
network Net1, has terminated before the MN moves to a new network Net2.
After moving to Net2, the MN uses the new IP prefix IP2, anchored to a
new access router AR2 in network Net2, to start a new flow. Packets may
then be forwarded without requiring IP-layer mobility
support.[¶](#section-4.1-6){.pilcrow}

An example call flow is outlined in [Figure
4](#fig_change-net-flow){.xref}. An MN attaches to AR1, which sends a
router advertisement (RA) including information about the prefix
assigned to the MN, from which the MN configures an IP address (IP1).
This address is used for new communications, for example, with a
correspondent node (CN). If the MN moves to a new network and attaches
to AR2, the process is repeated (the MN obtains a new IP address, IP2,
from AR2). Since the IP address (IP1) configured at the previously
visited network is not valid at the current attachment point, any
existing flows have to be reestablished using
IP2.[¶](#section-4.1-7){.pilcrow}

Note that in these scenarios, if there is no mobility support provided
by Layer 4 or above, application traffic would
stop.[¶](#section-4.1-8){.pilcrow}

### [4.2.](#section-4.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Mobility Case with Traffic Redirection](#name-mobility-case-with-traffic-){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-mobility-case-with-traffic-}

When IP mobility is needed for a flow, the LM and FM functions in
[Section 3.1](#sec_distributed-anchoring-configurations){.xref} are
utilized. There are two possible cases: (i) the mobility anchor remains
playing that role and forwards traffic to a new locator in the new
network, and (ii) the mobility anchor (data-plane function) is changed
but binds the MN\'s transferred IP address/prefix. The latter enables
optimized routes but requires some data-plane node that enforces traffic
indirection. We focus on the first case in this section. The second case
is addressed in [Section
4.3](#sec_anchor_relocation){.xref}.[¶](#section-4.2-1){.pilcrow}

Mobility support can be provided by using mobility management methods,
such as the approaches surveyed in the following academic papers:
\[[IEEE-DISTRIBUTED-MOBILITY](#IEEE-DISTRIBUTED-MOBILITY){.xref}\],
\[[PMIP-DMA](#PMIP-DMA){.xref}\], and
\[[DMM-MOBILE-INTERNET](#DMM-MOBILE-INTERNET){.xref}\]. After moving, a
certain MN\'s traffic flow may continue using the IP prefix from the
prior network of attachment. Yet, some time later, the application
generating this traffic flow may be closed. If the application is
started again, the new flow may not need to use the prior network\'s IP
address to avoid having to invoke IP mobility support. This may be the
case where a dynamic IP prefix/address, rather than a permanent one, is
used. Packets belonging to this flow may then use the new IP prefix (the
one allocated in the network where the flow is being initiated). Routing
is again kept simpler without employing IP mobility and will remain so
as long as the MN, which is now in the new network, does not move again
to another network.[¶](#section-4.2-2){.pilcrow}

An example call flow in this case is outlined in [Figure
5](#fig_flow-continuity){.xref}. In this example, the AR1 plays the role
of the FM-DP entity and redirects the traffic (e.g., using an IP tunnel)
to AR2.[¶](#section-4.2-3){.pilcrow}

anchoring in an appropriate configuration such as those described in

### [4.3.](#section-4.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Mobility Case with Anchor Relocation](#name-mobility-case-with-anchor-r){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-mobility-case-with-anchor-r}

We focus next on the case where the mobility anchor (data-plane
function) is changed but binds the MN\'s transferred IP address/prefix.
This enables optimized routes but requires some data-plane node that
enforces traffic indirection.[¶](#section-4.3-1){.pilcrow}

IP mobility is invoked to enable IP session continuity for an ongoing
flow as the MN moves to a new network. The anchoring of the IP address
of the flow is in the home network of the flow (i.e., different from the
current network of attachment). A centralized mobility management
mechanism may employ indirection from the anchor in the home network to
the current network of attachment. Yet, it may be difficult to avoid
using an unnecessarily long route (when the route between the MN and the
CN via the anchor in the home network is significantly longer than the
direct route between them). An alternative is to move the IP
prefix/address anchoring to the new
network.[¶](#section-4.3-2){.pilcrow}

The IP prefix/address anchoring may move without changing the IP
prefix/address of the flow. The LM function in [Figure
1](#fig_dmm_net-based){.xref} of [Section
3.1.1](#sec_distributed-anchoring-network-based){.xref} is implemented
as shown in [Figure
7](#fig_anchor-mobility){.xref}.[¶](#section-4.3-3){.pilcrow}

[Figure 7](#figure-7){.selfRef}: [Anchor
Relocation](#name-anchor-relocation){.selfRef}
:::

As an MN with an ongoing session moves to a new network, the flow may
preserve IP session continuity by moving the anchoring of the original
IP prefix/address of the flow to the new
network.[¶](#section-4.3-5){.pilcrow}

One way to accomplish such a move is to use a centralized routing
protocol, but such a solution may present some scalability concerns and
its applicability is typically limited to small networks. One example of
this type of solution is described in
\[[BGP-ATN-IPS](#I-D.ietf-rtgwg-atn-bgp){.xref}\]. When an MN associates
with an anchor, the anchor injects the MN\'s prefix into the global
routing system. If the MN moves to a new anchor, the old anchor
withdraws the /64 and the new anchor injects it
instead.[¶](#section-4.3-6){.pilcrow}

## [5.](#section-5){.section-number .selfRef} [Security Considerations](#name-security-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-security-considerations}

As stated in \[[RFC7333](#RFC7333){.xref}\], \"a DMM solution
[MUST]{.bcp14} support any security protocols and mechanisms needed to
secure the network and to make continuous security improvements\". It
\"[MUST NOT]{.bcp14} introduce new security
risks\".[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

There are different potential deployment models of a DMM solution. The
present document has presented three different scenarios for distributed
anchoring: (i) nomadic case, (ii) mobility case with traffic
redirection, and (iii) mobility case with anchor relocation. Each of
these cases has different security requirements, and the actual security
mechanisms depend on the specifics of each
solution/scenario.[¶](#section-5-2){.pilcrow}

As general rules, for the first distributed anchoring scenario (nomadic
case), no additional security consideration is needed, as this does not
involve any additional mechanism at Layer 3. If session connectivity is
required, the Layer 4 or above solution used to provide it
[MUST]{.bcp14} also provide the required authentication and
security.[¶](#section-5-3){.pilcrow}

The second and third distributed anchoring scenarios (mobility case)
involve mobility signaling among the mobile node and the control-plane
and data-plane anchors. The control-plane messages exchanged between
these entities [MUST]{.bcp14} be protected using end-to-end security
associations with data-integrity and data-origination capabilities.
IPsec \[[RFC8221](#RFC8221){.xref}\] Encapsulating Security Payload
(ESP) in transport mode with mandatory integrity protection
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} be used for protecting the signaling messages. Internet
Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2) \[[RFC8247](#RFC8247){.xref}\]
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} be used to set up security associations between the
data-plane and control-plane anchors. Note that in scenarios in which
traffic indirection mechanisms are used to relocate an anchor,
authentication and authorization mechanisms [MUST]{.bcp14} be
used.[¶](#section-5-4){.pilcrow}

Control-plane functionality [MUST]{.bcp14} apply authorization checks to
any commands or updates that are made by the control-plane
protocol.[¶](#section-5-5){.pilcrow}
