Secure Shell (SSH) \[[RFC4251](#RFC4251){.xref}\] is a secure remote
login protocol. The key exchange protocol described in
\[[RFC4253](#RFC4253){.xref}\] supports an extensible set of methods.
\[[RFC5656](#RFC5656){.xref}\] defines how elliptic curves are
integrated into this extensible SSH framework, and this document reuses
the Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key exchange protocol messages
defined in Section
[7.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5656#section-7.1){.relref}
([ECDH Message
Numbers](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5656#section-7.1){.relref})
of \[[RFC5656](#RFC5656){.xref}\]. Other parts of
\[[RFC5656](#RFC5656){.xref}\], such as Elliptic Curve
Menezes-Qu-Vanstone (ECMQV) key agreement and Elliptic Curve Digital
Signature Algorithm (ECDSA), are not considered in this
document.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

This document describes how to implement key exchange based on
Curve25519 and Curve448 \[[RFC7748](#RFC7748){.xref}\] in SSH. For
Curve25519 with SHA-256
\[[RFC6234](#RFC6234){.xref}\]\[[SHS](#SHS){.xref}\], the algorithm
described is equivalent to the privately defined algorithm
\"curve25519-sha256\@libssh.org\", which at the time of publication was
implemented and widely deployed in libssh \[[libssh](#libssh){.xref}\]
and OpenSSH \[[OpenSSH](#OpenSSH){.xref}\]. The Curve448 key exchange
method is similar but uses SHA-512
\[[RFC6234](#RFC6234){.xref}\]\[[SHS](#SHS){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-3 .section}
## [3.](#section-3){.section-number .selfRef} [Key Exchange Methods](#name-key-exchange-methods){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-key-exchange-methods}

The key exchange procedure is similar to the ECDH method described in
[Section 4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5656#section-4){.relref}
of \[[RFC5656](#RFC5656){.xref}\], though with a different wire encoding
used for public values and the final shared secret. Public ephemeral
keys are encoded for transmission as standard SSH
strings.[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

The protocol flow, the SSH_MSG_KEX_ECDH_INIT and SSH_MSG_KEX_ECDH_REPLY
messages, and the structure of the exchange hash are identical to
[Section 4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5656#section-4){.relref}
of \[[RFC5656](#RFC5656){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3-2){.pilcrow}

The method names registered by this document are \"curve25519-sha256\"
and \"curve448-sha512\".[¶](#section-3-3){.pilcrow}

The methods are based on Curve25519 and Curve448 scalar multiplication,
as described in \[[RFC7748](#RFC7748){.xref}\]. Private and public keys
are generated as described therein. Public keys are defined as strings
of 32 bytes for Curve25519 and 56 bytes for
Curve448.[¶](#section-3-4){.pilcrow}

The key-agreement schemes \"curve25519-sha256\" and \"curve448-sha512\"
perform the Diffie-Hellman protocol using the functions X25519 and X448,
respectively. Implementations [SHOULD]{.bcp14} compute these functions
using the algorithms described in \[[RFC7748](#RFC7748){.xref}\]. When
they do so, implementations [MUST]{.bcp14} check whether the computed
Diffie-Hellman shared secret is the all-zero value and abort if so, as
described in [Section
6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7748#section-6){.relref} of
\[[RFC7748](#RFC7748){.xref}\]. Alternative implementations of these
functions [SHOULD]{.bcp14} abort when either the client or the server
input forces the shared secret to one of a small set of values, as
described in Sections
[6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7748#section-6){.relref} and
[7](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7748#section-7){.relref} of
\[[RFC7748](#RFC7748){.xref}\]. Clients and servers [MUST]{.bcp14} also
abort if the length of the received public keys are not the expected
lengths. An abort for these purposes is defined as a disconnect
(SSH_MSG_DISCONNECT) of the session and [SHOULD]{.bcp14} use the
SSH_DISCONNECT_KEY_EXCHANGE_FAILED reason for the message
\[[IANA-REASON](#IANA-REASON){.xref}\]. No further validation is
required beyond what is described in \[[RFC7748](#RFC7748){.xref}\]. The
derived shared secret is 32 bytes when \"curve25519-sha256\" is used and
56 bytes when \"curve448-sha512\" is used. The encodings of all values
are defined in \[[RFC7748](#RFC7748){.xref}\]. The hash used is SHA-256
for \"curve25519-sha256\" and SHA-512 for
\"curve448-sha512\".[¶](#section-3-5){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-3.1 .section}
### [3.1.](#section-3.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Shared Secret Encoding](#name-shared-secret-encoding){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-shared-secret-encoding}

The following step differs from \[[RFC5656](#RFC5656){.xref}\], which
uses a different conversion. This is not intended to modify that text
generally, but only to be applicable to the scope of the mechanism
described in this document.[¶](#section-3.1-1){.pilcrow}

The shared secret, K, is defined in \[[RFC4253](#RFC4253){.xref}\] and
\[[RFC5656](#RFC5656){.xref}\] as an integer encoded as a multiple
precision integer (mpint). Curve25519/448 outputs a binary string X,
which is the 32- or 56-byte point obtained by scalar multiplication of
the other side\'s public key and the local private key scalar. The 32 or
56 bytes of X are converted into K by interpreting the octets as an
unsigned fixed-length integer encoded in network byte
order.[¶](#section-3.1-2){.pilcrow}

The mpint K is then encoded using the process described in [Section
5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4251#section-5){.relref} of
\[[RFC4251](#RFC4251){.xref}\], and the resulting bytes are fed as
described in \[[RFC4253](#RFC4253){.xref}\] to the key exchange
method\'s hash function to generate encryption
keys.[¶](#section-3.1-3){.pilcrow}

When performing the X25519 or X448 operations, the integer values there
will be encoded into byte strings by doing a fixed-length unsigned
little-endian conversion, per \[[RFC7748](#RFC7748){.xref}\]. It is only
later when these byte strings are then passed to the ECDH function in
SSH that the bytes are reinterpreted as a fixed-length unsigned
big-endian integer value K, and then later that K value is encoded as a
variable-length signed \"mpint\" before being fed to the hash algorithm
used for key generation. The mpint K is then fed along with other data
to the key exchange method\'s hash function to generate encryption
keys.[¶](#section-3.1-4){.pilcrow}

## [4.](#section-4){.section-number .selfRef} [Security Considerations](#name-security-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-security-considerations}

The security considerations of \[[RFC4251](#RFC4251){.xref}\],
\[[RFC5656](#RFC5656){.xref}\], and \[[RFC7748](#RFC7748){.xref}\] are
inherited.[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

Curve25519 with SHA-256 provides strong (\~128 bits) security, is
efficient on a wide range of architectures, and has characteristics that
allow for better implementation properties compared to traditional
elliptic curves. Curve448 with SHA-512 provides stronger (\~224 bits)
security with similar implementation properties; however, it has not
received the same cryptographic review as Curve25519. It is also slower
(larger key material and larger secure hash algorithm), but it is
provided as a hedge to combat unforeseen analytical advances against
Curve25519 and SHA-256 due to the larger number of security
bits.[¶](#section-4-2){.pilcrow}

The way the derived mpint binary secret string is encoded before it is
hashed (i.e., adding or removing zero bytes for encoding) raises the
potential for a side-channel attack, which could determine the length of
what is hashed. This would leak the most significant bit of the derived
secret and/or allow detection of when the most significant bytes are
zero. For backwards-compatibility reasons, it was decided not to address
this potential problem.[¶](#section-4-3){.pilcrow}

This document provides \"curve25519-sha256\" as the preferred choice but
suggests that the \"curve448-sha512\" be implemented to provide more
than 128 bits of security strength should that become a
requirement.[¶](#section-4-4){.pilcrow}
