# Poll-Based Security Event Token (SET) Delivery Using HTTP {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

This specification defines how a series of Security Event Tokens (SETs)
can be delivered to an intended recipient using HTTP POST over TLS
initiated as a poll by the recipient. The specification also defines how
delivery can be assured, subject to the SET Recipient\'s need for
assurance.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

This specification defines how a stream of Security Event Tokens (SETs)
\[[RFC8417](#RFC8417){.xref}\] can be transmitted to an intended SET
Recipient using HTTP \[[RFC7231](#RFC7231){.xref}\] over TLS. The
specification defines a method to poll for SETs using HTTP POST. This is
an alternative SET delivery method to the one defined in
\[[RFC8935](#RFC8935){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

Poll-based SET delivery is intended for scenarios where all of the
following apply:[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

-   [The recipient of the SET is capable of making outbound HTTP
    requests.[¶](#section-1-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-3.1}
-   [The transmitter is capable of hosting a TLS-enabled HTTP endpoint
    that is accessible to the
    recipient.[¶](#section-1-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-3.2}
-   [The transmitter and recipient are willing to exchange data with one
    another.[¶](#section-1-3.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-3.3}

In some scenarios, either push-based or poll-based delivery could be
used, and in others, only one of them would be
applicable.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

A mechanism for exchanging configuration metadata such as endpoint URLs,
cryptographic keys, and possible implementation constraints such as
buffer size limitations between the transmitter and recipient is out of
scope for this specification. How SETs are defined and the process by
which security events are identified for SET Recipients are specified in
\[[RFC8417](#RFC8417){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}

## [2.](#section-2){.section-number .selfRef} [SET Delivery](#name-set-delivery){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-set-delivery}

When a SET is available for a SET Recipient, the SET Transmitter queues
the SET in a buffer so that a SET Recipient can poll for SETs using HTTP
POST.[¶](#section-2-1){.pilcrow}

In poll-based SET delivery using HTTP over TLS, zero or more SETs are
delivered in a JSON \[[RFC8259](#RFC8259){.xref}\] document to a SET
Recipient in response to an HTTP POST request to the SET Transmitter.
Then in a following request, the SET Recipient acknowledges received
SETs and can poll for more. All requests and responses are JSON
documents and use a `Content-Type` of `application/json`, as described
in [Section 2.2](#pollReq){.xref}.[¶](#section-2-2){.pilcrow}

After successful (acknowledged) SET delivery, SET Transmitters are not
required to retain or record SETs for retransmission. Once a SET is
acknowledged, the SET Recipient [SHALL]{.bcp14} be responsible for
retention, if needed. Transmitters may also discard undelivered SETs
under deployment-specific conditions, such as if they have not been
polled for over too long a period of time or if an excessive amount of
storage is needed to retain them.[¶](#section-2-3){.pilcrow}

Upon receiving a SET, the SET Recipient reads the SET and validates it
in the manner described in [Section
2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8935#section-2){.relref} of
\[[RFC8935](#RFC8935){.xref}\]. The SET Recipient [MUST]{.bcp14}
acknowledge receipt to the SET Transmitter, and [SHOULD]{.bcp14} do so
in a timely fashion, as described in [Section 2.4](#pollRequest){.xref}.
The SET Recipient [SHALL NOT]{.bcp14} use the event acknowledgement
mechanism to report event errors other than those relating to the
parsing and validation of the SET.[¶](#section-2-4){.pilcrow}

### [2.1.](#section-2.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Polling Delivery using HTTP](#name-polling-delivery-using-http){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-polling-delivery-using-http}

This method allows a SET Recipient to use HTTP POST ([Section
4.3.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7231#section-4.3.3){.relref} of
\[[RFC7231](#RFC7231){.xref}\]) to acknowledge SETs and to check for and
receive zero or more SETs. Requests [MAY]{.bcp14} be made at a periodic
interval (short polling) or requests [MAY]{.bcp14} wait, pending
availability of new SETs using long polling, per [Section
2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6202#section-2){.relref} of
\[[RFC6202](#RFC6202){.xref}\]. Note that short polling will result in
retrieving zero or more SETs whereas long polling will typically result
in retrieving one or more SETs unless a timeout
occurs.[¶](#section-2.1-1){.pilcrow}

The delivery of SETs in this method is facilitated by HTTP POST requests
initiated by the SET Recipient in which:[¶](#section-2.1-2){.pilcrow}

-   [The SET Recipient makes a request for available SETs using an HTTP
    POST to a pre-arranged endpoint provided by the SET Transmitter,
    or[¶](#section-2.1-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.1-3.1}
-   [after validating previously received SETs, the SET Recipient
    initiates another poll request using HTTP POST that includes
    acknowledgement of previous SETs and requests the next batch of
    SETs.[¶](#section-2.1-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.1-3.2}

The purpose of the acknowledgement is to inform the SET Transmitter that
delivery has succeeded and redelivery is no longer required. Before
acknowledgement, SET Recipients validate the received SETs and retain
them in a manner appropriate to the recipient\'s requirements. The level
and method of retention of SETs by SET Recipients is out of scope of
this specification.[¶](#section-2.1-4){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-2.2 .section}
### [2.2.](#section-2.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Polling HTTP Request](#name-polling-http-request){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-polling-http-request}

When initiating a poll request, the SET Recipient constructs a JSON
document that consists of polling request parameters and SET
acknowledgement parameters in the form of JSON
objects.[¶](#section-2.2-1){.pilcrow}

When making a request, the HTTP `Content-Type` header field is set to
`application/json`.[¶](#section-2.2-2){.pilcrow}

The following JSON object members are used in a polling
request:[¶](#section-2.2-3){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

Request Processing Parameters
:   []{.break}

    maxEvents
    :   An [OPTIONAL]{.bcp14} integer value indicating the maximum
        number of unacknowledged SETs to be returned. The SET
        Transmitter [SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} send more SETs than the
        specified maximum. If more than the maximum number of SETs are
        available, the SET Transmitter determines which to return first;
        the oldest SETs available [MAY]{.bcp14} be returned first, or
        another selection algorithm [MAY]{.bcp14} be used, such as
        prioritizing SETs in some manner that makes sense for the use
        case. A value of `0` [MAY]{.bcp14} be used by SET Recipients
        that would like to perform an acknowledge-only request. This
        enables the Recipient to use separate HTTP requests for
        acknowledgement and reception of SETs. If this parameter is
        omitted, no limit is placed on the number of SETs to be
        returned.[¶](#section-2.2-4.2.1.2){.pilcrow}
    :   

    returnImmediately
    :   An [OPTIONAL]{.bcp14} JSON boolean value that indicates the SET
        Transmitter [SHOULD]{.bcp14} return an immediate response even
        if no results are available (short polling). The default value
        is `false`, which indicates the request is to be treated as an
        HTTP long poll, per [Section
        2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6202#section-2){.relref} of
        \[[RFC6202](#RFC6202){.xref}\]. The timeout for the request is
        part of the configuration between the participants, which is out
        of scope of this
        specification.[¶](#section-2.2-4.2.1.4){.pilcrow}

    :   A JSON array of strings whose values are the `jti`
        \[[RFC7519](#RFC7519){.xref}\] values of successfully received
        SETs that are being acknowledged. If there are no outstanding
        SETs to acknowledge, this member is omitted or contains an empty
        array. Once a SET has been acknowledged, the SET Transmitter is
        released from any obligation to retain the
        SET.[¶](#section-2.2-5.2.1.2){.pilcrow}
    :   

    setErrs
    :   A JSON object with one or more members whose keys are the `jti`
        values of invalid SETs received. The values of these objects are
        themselves JSON objects that describe the errors detected using
        the `err` and `description` values specified in [Section
        2.6](#errorResponse){.xref}. If there are no outstanding SETs
        with errors to report, this member is omitted or contains an

\[[RFC7231](#RFC7231){.xref}\]) to a pre-arranged polling endpoint URI
to check for SETs that are available. Because the SET Recipient has no
prior SETs to acknowledge, the `ack` and `setErrs` request parameters
are omitted.[¶](#section-2.4-1){.pilcrow}

After a period of time configured in an out-of-band manner between the
SET Transmitter and Recipient, a SET Transmitter [MAY]{.bcp14} redeliver
SETs it has previously delivered. The SET Recipient [SHOULD]{.bcp14}
accept repeat SETs and acknowledge the SETs regardless of whether the
Recipient believes it has already acknowledged the SETs previously. A
SET Transmitter [MAY]{.bcp14} limit the number of times it attempts to
deliver a SET.[¶](#section-2.4-2){.pilcrow}

If the SET Recipient has received SETs from the SET Transmitter, the SET
Recipient parses and validates that received SETs meet its own
requirements and [SHOULD]{.bcp14} acknowledge receipt in a timely
fashion (e.g., seconds or minutes) so that the SET Transmitter can mark
the SETs as received. SET Recipients [SHOULD]{.bcp14} acknowledge
receipt before taking any local actions based on the SETs to avoid
unnecessary delay in acknowledgement, where
possible.[¶](#section-2.4-3){.pilcrow}

Poll requests have three variations:
:   []{.break}

    Poll-Only
    :   In this scenario, a SET Recipient asks for the next set of
        events where no previous SET deliveries are acknowledged (such
        as in the initial poll
        request).[¶](#section-2.4-4.2.1.2){.pilcrow}
    :   

    Acknowledge-Only
    :   In this scenario, a SET Recipient sets the `maxEvents` value to
        `0` along with `ack` and `setErrs` members indicating the SET
        Recipient is acknowledging previously received SETs and does not
        want to receive any new SETs in response to the
        request.[¶](#section-2.4-4.2.1.4){.pilcrow}
    :   

    Combined Acknowledge and Poll
    :   In this scenario, a SET Recipient is both acknowledging
        previously received SETs using the `ack` and `setErrs` members
        and will wait for the next group of SETs in the SET Transmitters
        response.[¶](#section-2.4-4.2.1.6){.pilcrow}

Transmitting bearer tokens \[[RFC6750](#RFC6750){.xref}\] using TLS
helps prevent their interception.[¶](#section-4.4.1-1){.pilcrow}

Bearer tokens [SHOULD]{.bcp14} have a limited lifetime that can be
determined directly or indirectly (e.g., by checking with a validation
service) by the service provider. By expiring tokens, clients are forced
to obtain a new token (which usually involves re-authentication) for
continued authorized access. For example, in OAuth 2.0, a client
[MAY]{.bcp14} use an OAuth refresh token to obtain a new bearer token
after authenticating to an authorization server, per [Section
6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749#section-6){.relref} of
\[[RFC6749](#RFC6749){.xref}\].[¶](#section-4.4.1-2){.pilcrow}

Implementations supporting OAuth bearer tokens need to factor in
security considerations of this authorization method
\[[RFC7521](#RFC7521){.xref}\]. Since security is only as good as the
weakest link, implementers also need to consider authentication choices
coupled with OAuth bearer tokens. The security considerations of the
default authentication method for OAuth bearer tokens, HTTP Basic, are
well documented in \[[RFC7617](#RFC7617){.xref}\]; therefore,
implementers are encouraged to prefer stronger authentication
methods.[¶](#section-4.4.1-3){.pilcrow}

## [Appendix A.](#section-appendix.a){.section-number .selfRef} [Unencrypted Transport Considerations](#name-unencrypted-transport-consi){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-unencrypted-transport-consi}

Earlier versions of this specification made the use of TLS optional and
described security and privacy considerations resulting from use of
unencrypted HTTP as the underlying transport. When the working group
decided to mandate usage of HTTP over TLS, it also decided to preserve
the description of these considerations in a non-normative
manner.[¶](#section-appendix.a-1){.pilcrow}

The considerations for using unencrypted HTTP with this protocol are the
same as those described in [Appendix
A](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8935#appendix-A){.relref} of
\[[RFC8935](#RFC8935){.xref}\], and are therefore not repeated
here.[¶](#section-appendix.a-2){.pilcrow}
