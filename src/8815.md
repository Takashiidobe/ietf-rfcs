# Deprecating Any-Source Multicast (ASM) for Interdomain Multicast {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

This document recommends deprecation of the use of Any-Source Multicast
(ASM) for interdomain multicast. It recommends the use of
Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) for interdomain multicast applications
and recommends that hosts and routers in these deployments fully support
SSM. The recommendations in this document do not preclude the continued
use of ASM within a single organization or domain and are especially
easy to adopt in existing deployments of intradomain ASM using PIM
Sparse Mode (PIM-SM).[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

## [1.](#section-1){.section-number .selfRef} [Introduction](#name-introduction){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-introduction}

IP Multicast has been deployed in various forms, within private
networks, the wider Internet, and federated networks such as national or
regional research networks. While a number of service models have been
published, and in many cases revised over time, there has been no strong
recommendation made by the IETF on the appropriateness of those models
to certain scenarios, even though vendors and federations have often
made such recommendations.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

This document addresses this gap by making a BCP-level recommendation to
deprecate the use of Any-Source Multicast (ASM) for interdomain
multicast, leaving Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) as the recommended
interdomain mode of multicast. Therefore, this document recommends that
all hosts and routers that support interdomain multicast applications
fully support SSM.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

This document does not make any statement on the use of ASM within a
single domain or organization and, therefore, does not preclude its use.
Indeed, there are application contexts for which ASM is currently still
widely considered well suited within a single
domain.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

The main issue in most cases with moving to SSM is application support.
Many applications are initially deployed for intradomain use and are
later deployed interdomain. Therefore, this document recommends that
applications support SSM, even when they are initially intended for
intradomain use. As explained below, SSM applications are readily
compatible with existing intradomain ASM deployments using PIM-SM, as
PIM-SSM is merely a subset of PIM-SM.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

### [2.1.](#section-2.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Multicast Service Models](#name-multicast-service-models){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-multicast-service-models}

Any-Source Multicast (ASM) and Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) are the
two multicast service models in use today. In ASM, as originally
described in \[[RFC1112](#RFC1112){.xref}\], receivers express interest
in joining a multicast group address, and routers use multicast routing
protocols to deliver traffic from the sender(s) to the receivers. If
there are multiple senders for a given group, traffic from all senders
will be delivered to the receivers. Since receivers specify only the
group address, the network \-- and therefore the multicast routing
protocols \-- are responsible for source
discovery.[¶](#section-2.1-1){.pilcrow}

In SSM, by contrast, receivers specify both group and source when
expressing interest in joining a multicast stream. Source discovery in
SSM is handled by some out-of-band mechanism (typically in the
application layer), which drastically simplifies the network and how the
multicast routing protocols operate.[¶](#section-2.1-2){.pilcrow}

IANA has reserved specific ranges of IPv4 and IPv6 address space for
multicast addressing. Guidelines for IPv4 multicast address assignments
can be found in \[[RFC5771](#RFC5771){.xref}\], while guidelines for
IPv6 multicast address assignments can be found in
\[[RFC2375](#RFC2375){.xref}\] and \[[RFC3307](#RFC3307){.xref}\]. The
IPv6 multicast address format is described in
\[[RFC4291](#RFC4291){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2.1-3){.pilcrow}

#### [2.2.1.](#section-2.2.1){.section-number .selfRef} [PIM Sparse Mode (PIM-SM)](#name-pim-sparse-mode-pim-sm){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-pim-sparse-mode-pim-sm}

The most commonly deployed ASM routing protocol is Protocol Independent
Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM), as detailed in
\[[RFC7761](#RFC7761){.xref}\]. PIM-SM, as the name suggests, was
designed to be used in scenarios where the subnets with receivers are
sparsely distributed throughout the network. Because receivers do not
indicate sender addresses in ASM (but only group addresses), PIM-SM uses
the concept of a Rendezvous Point (RP) as a \"meeting point\" for
sources and receivers, and all routers in a PIM-SM domain are configured
to use a specific RP(s), either explicitly or through dynamic
RP-discovery protocols.[¶](#section-2.2.1-1){.pilcrow}

To enable PIM-SM to work between multiple domains, an interdomain,
inter-RP signaling protocol known as Multicast Source Discovery Protocol
(MSDP) \[[RFC3618](#RFC3618){.xref}\] is used to allow an RP in one
domain to learn of the existence of a source in another domain.
Deployment scenarios for MSDP are given in
\[[RFC4611](#RFC4611){.xref}\]. MSDP floods information about all active
sources for all multicast streams to all RPs in all the domains \-- even
if there is no receiver for a given application in a domain. As a result
of this key scalability and security issue, along with other deployment
challenges with the protocol, MSDP was never extended to support IPv6
and remains an Experimental protocol.[¶](#section-2.2.1-2){.pilcrow}

At the time of writing, there is no IETF interdomain solution at the
level of Proposed Standard for IPv4 ASM multicast, because MSDP was the
de facto mechanism for the interdomain source discovery problem, and it
is Experimental. Other protocol options were investigated at the same
time but were never implemented or deployed and are now historic (e.g.,
\[[RFC3913](#RFC3913){.xref}\]).[¶](#section-2.2.1-3){.pilcrow}

#### [2.2.2.](#section-2.2.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Embedded-RP](#name-embedded-rp){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-embedded-rp}

Due to the availability of more bits in an IPv6 address than in IPv4, an
IPv6-specific mechanism was designed in support of interdomain ASM, with
PIM-SM leveraging those bits. Embedded-RP \[[RFC3956](#RFC3956){.xref}\]
allows routers supporting the protocol to determine the RP for the group
without any prior configuration or discovery protocols, simply by
observing the unicast RP address that is embedded (included) in the IPv6
multicast group address. Embedded-RP allows PIM-SM operation across any
IPv6 network in which there is an end-to-end path of routers supporting
this mechanism, including interdomain
deployment.[¶](#section-2.2.2-1){.pilcrow}

BIDIR-PIM \[[RFC5015](#RFC5015){.xref}\] is another protocol to support
ASM. There is no standardized option to operate BIDIR-PIM interdomain.
It is deployed intradomain for applications where many sources send
traffic to the same IP multicast groups because, unlike PIM-SM, it does
not create per-source state. BIDIR-PIM is one of the important reasons
for this document to not deprecate intradomain
ASM.[¶](#section-2.2.3-1){.pilcrow}

### [2.3.](#section-2.3){.section-number .selfRef} [SSM Routing Protocols](#name-ssm-routing-protocols){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-ssm-routing-protocols}

SSM is detailed in \[[RFC4607](#RFC4607){.xref}\]. It mandates the use
of PIM-SSM for routing of SSM. PIM-SSM is merely a subset of PIM-SM
\[[RFC7761](#RFC7761){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2.3-1){.pilcrow}

PIM-SSM expects the sender\'s source address(es) to be known in advance
by receivers through some out-of-band mechanism (typically in the
application layer); thus, the receiver\'s designated router can send a
PIM Join message directly towards the source without needing to use an
RP.[¶](#section-2.3-2){.pilcrow}

IPv4 addresses in the 232/8 (232.0.0.0 to 232.255.255.255) range are
designated as Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) destination addresses and
are reserved for use by source-specific applications and protocols. For
IPv6, the address prefix ff3x::/32 is reserved for source-specific
multicast use. See
\[[RFC4607](#RFC4607){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2.3-3){.pilcrow}

### [3.1.](#section-3.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Observations on ASM and SSM Deployments](#name-observations-on-asm-and-ssm){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-observations-on-asm-and-ssm}

In enterprise and campus scenarios, ASM in the form of PIM-SM is likely
the most commonly deployed multicast protocol. The configuration and
management of an RP (including RP redundancy) within a single domain is
a well-understood operational practice. However, if interworking with
external PIM domains is needed in IPv4 multicast deployments,
interdomain MSDP is required to exchange information about sources
between domain RPs. Deployment experience has shown MSDP to be a complex
and fragile protocol to manage and troubleshoot. Some of these issues
include complex Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF) rules, state attack
protection, and filtering of undesired
sources.[¶](#section-3.1-1){.pilcrow}

PIM-SM is a general-purpose protocol that can handle all use cases. In
particular, it was designed for cases such as videoconferencing where
multiple sources may come and go during a multicast session. But for
cases where a single, persistent source for a group is used, and
receivers can be configured to know of that source, PIM-SM has
unnecessary complexity. Therefore, SSM removes the need for many of the
most complex components of PIM-SM.[¶](#section-3.1-2){.pilcrow}

As explained above, MSDP was not extended to support IPv6. Instead, the
proposed interdomain ASM solution for PIM-SM with IPv6 is Embedded-RP,
which allows the RP address for a multicast group to be embedded in the
group address, making RP discovery automatic for all routers on the path
between a receiver and a sender. Embedded-RP can support lightweight ad
hoc deployments. However, it relies on a single RP for an entire group
that could only be made resilient within one domain. While this approach
solves the MSDP issues, it does not solve the problem of unauthorized
sources sending traffic to ASM multicast groups; this security issue is
one of biggest problems of interdomain
multicast.[¶](#section-3.1-3){.pilcrow}

As stated in RFC 4607, SSM is particularly well suited to either
dissemination-style applications with one or more senders whose
identities are known (by some out-of-band mechanism) before the
application starts running or applications that utilize some signaling
to indicate the source address of the multicast stream (e.g., an
electronic programming guide in IPTV applications). Therefore, SSM
through PIM-SSM is very well suited to applications such as classic
linear-broadcast TV over IP.[¶](#section-3.1-4){.pilcrow}

SSM requires applications, host operating systems, and the designated
routers connected to receiving hosts to support Internet Group
Management Protocol, Version 3 (IGMPv3) \[[RFC3376](#RFC3376){.xref}\]
and Multicast Listener Discovery, Version 2 (MLDv2)
\[[RFC3810](#RFC3810){.xref}\]. While support for IGMPv3 and MLDv2 has
been commonplace in routing platforms for a long time, it has also now
become widespread in common operating systems for several years
(Windows, Mac OS, Linux/Android) and is no longer an impediment to SSM
deployment.[¶](#section-3.1-5){.pilcrow}

This section describes the three key benefits that SSM with PIM-SSM has
over ASM. These benefits also apply to intradomain deployment but are
even more important in interdomain deployments. See
\[[RFC4607](#RFC4607){.xref}\] for more

#### [3.2.1.](#section-3.2.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Reduced Network Operations Complexity](#name-reduced-network-operations-){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-reduced-network-operations-}

A significant benefit of SSM is the reduced complexity that comes
through eliminating the network-based source discovery required in ASM
with PIM-SM. Specifically, SSM eliminates the need for RPs, shared
trees, Shortest Path Tree (SPT) switchovers, PIM registers, MSDP,
dynamic RP-discovery mechanisms (Bootstrap Router (BSR) / AutoRP), and
data-driven state creation. SSM simply utilizes a small subset of
PIM-SM, alongside the integration with IGMPv3/MLDv2, where the source
address signaled from the receiver is immediately used to create (S,G)
state. Eliminating network-based source discovery for interdomain
multicast means the vast majority of the complexity of multicast goes
away.[¶](#section-3.2.1-1){.pilcrow}

This reduced complexity makes SSM radically simpler to manage,
troubleshoot, and operate, particularly for backbone network operators.
This is the main operator motivation for the recommendation to deprecate
the use of ASM in interdomain scenarios.[¶](#section-3.2.1-2){.pilcrow}

Note that this discussion does not apply to BIDIR-PIM, and there is (as
mentioned above) no standardized interdomain solution for BIDIR-PIM. In
BIDIR-PIM, traffic is forwarded to the RP instead of building state as
in PIM-SM. This occurs even in the absence of receivers. Therefore,
BIDIR-PIM offers a trade-off of state complexity at the cost of creating
unnecessary traffic (potentially a large
amount).[¶](#section-3.2.1-3){.pilcrow}

In ASM, IP multicast group addresses need to be assigned to applications

instances will not share the same group address and receive IP multicast
traffic from each other.[¶](#section-3.2.2-1){.pilcrow}

In SSM, no such IP multicast group management is necessary. Instead, the
IP multicast group address simply needs to be assigned locally on a
source like a unicast transport protocol port number: the only
coordination required is to ensure that different applications running
on the same host don\'t send to the same group address. This does not
require any network-operator involvement.[¶](#section-3.2.2-2){.pilcrow}

SSM is implicitly secure against off-path unauthorized/undesired
sources. Receivers only receive packets from the sources they explicitly
specify in their IGMPv3/MLDv2 membership messages, as opposed to ASM,
where any host can send traffic to a group address and have it
transmitted to all receivers. With PIM-SSM, traffic from sources not
requested by any receiver will be discarded by the First-Hop Router
(FHR) of that source, minimizing source attacks against shared network
bandwidth and receivers.[¶](#section-3.2.3-1){.pilcrow}

This benefit is particularly important in interdomain deployments
because there are no standardized solutions for ASM control of sources
and the most common intradomain operational practices such as Access
Control Lists (ACLs) on the sender\'s FHR are not feasible for
interdomain deployments.[¶](#section-3.2.3-2){.pilcrow}

This document recommends that the use of ASM be deprecated for
interdomain multicast; thus, implicitly, it recommends that hosts and
routers that support such interdomain applications fully support SSM and
its associated protocols. Best current practices for deploying
interdomain multicast using SSM are documented in
\[[RFC8313](#RFC8313){.xref}\].[¶](#section-4.1-1){.pilcrow}

The recommendation applies to the use of ASM between domains where
either MSDP (IPv4) or Embedded-RP (IPv6) is
used.[¶](#section-4.1-2){.pilcrow}

An interdomain use of ASM multicast in the context of this document is
one where PIM-SM with RPs/MSDP/Embedded-RP is run on routers operated by
two or more separate administrative
entities.[¶](#section-4.1-3){.pilcrow}

The focus of this document is deprecation of interdomain ASM multicast,
and while encouraging the use of SSM within domains, it leaves operators
free to choose to use ASM within their own domains. A more inclusive
interpretation of this recommendation is that it also extends to
deprecating use of ASM in the case where PIM is operated in a single
operator domain, but where user hosts or non-PIM network edge devices
are under different operator control. A typical example of this case is
a service provider offering IPTV (single operator domain for PIM) to
subscribers operating an IGMP proxy home gateway and IGMPv3/MLDv2 hosts
(computer, tablets, set-top boxes).[¶](#section-4.1-4){.pilcrow}

This document recommends that all hosts, router platforms, and security
appliances used for deploying multicast support the components of IGMPv3
\[[RFC3376](#RFC3376){.xref}\] and MLDv2 \[[RFC3810](#RFC3810){.xref}\]
necessary to support SSM (i.e., explicitly sending source-specific
reports). \"IPv6 Node Requirements\" \[[RFC8504](#RFC8504){.xref}\]
states that MLDv2 must be supported in all implementations. Such support
is already widespread in common host and router
platforms.[¶](#section-4.2-1){.pilcrow}

Further guidance on IGMPv3 and MLDv2 is given in
\[[RFC4604](#RFC4604){.xref}\].[¶](#section-4.2-2){.pilcrow}

Multicast snooping is often used to limit the flooding of multicast
traffic in a Layer 2 network. With snooping, an L2 switch will monitor
IGMP/MLD messages and only forward multicast traffic out on host ports
that have interested receivers connected. Such snooping capability
should therefore support IGMPv3 and MLDv2. There is further discussion
in \[[RFC4541](#RFC4541){.xref}\].[¶](#section-4.2-3){.pilcrow}

### [4.3.](#section-4.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Building Application Support for SSM](#name-building-application-suppor){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-building-application-suppor}

The recommendation to use SSM for interdomain multicast means that
applications should properly trigger the sending of IGMPv3/MLDv2
source-specific report messages. It should be noted, however, that there
is a wide range of applications today that only support ASM. In many
cases, this is due to application developers being unaware of the
operational concerns of networks and the implications of using ASM
versus SSM. This document serves to provide clear direction for
application developers who might currently only consider using ASM to
instead support SSM, which only requires relatively minor changes for
many applications, particularly those with single
sources.[¶](#section-4.3-1){.pilcrow}

It is often thought that ASM is required for multicast applications
where there are multiple sources. However, RFC 4607 also describes how
SSM can be used instead of PIM-SM for multi-party
applications:[¶](#section-4.3-2){.pilcrow}

> SSM can be used to build multi-source applications where all
> participants\' identities are not known in advance, but the
> multi-source \"rendezvous\" functionality does not occur in the
> network layer in this case. Just like in an application that uses
> unicast as the underlying transport, this functionality can be
> implemented by the application or by an application-layer
> library.[¶](#section-4.3-3){.pilcrow}

### [4.4.](#section-4.4){.section-number .selfRef} [Developing Application Guidance: SSM, ASM, Service Discovery](#name-developing-application-guid){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-developing-application-guid}

Applications with many-to-many communication patterns can create more
(S,G) state than is feasible for networks to manage, whether the source
discovery is done by ASM with PIM-SM or at the application level and
SSM/PIM-SSM. These applications are not best supported by either
SSM/PIM-SSM or ASM/PIM-SM.[¶](#section-4.4-1){.pilcrow}

Instead, these applications are better served by routing protocols that
do not create (S,G), such as BIDIR-PIM. Unfortunately, many applications
today use ASM solely for service discovery. One example is where clients
send IP multicast packets to elicit unicast replies from server(s).
Deploying any form of IP multicast solely in support of such service
discovery is, in general, not recommended. Dedicated service discovery
via DNS-based Service Discovery (DNS-SD) \[[RFC6763](#RFC6763){.xref}\]
should be used for this instead.[¶](#section-4.4-2){.pilcrow}

This document describes best practices to explain when to use SSM in
applications \-- e.g., when ASM without (S,G) state in the network is
better, or when dedicated service-discovery mechanisms should be used.
However, specifying how applications can support these practices is
outside the scope of this document. Further work on this subject may be
expected within the IETF.[¶](#section-4.4-3){.pilcrow}

### [4.5.](#section-4.5){.section-number .selfRef} [Preferring SSM Applications Intradomain](#name-preferring-ssm-applications){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-preferring-ssm-applications}

If feasible, it is recommended for applications to use SSM even if they
are initially only meant to be used in intradomain environments
supporting ASM. Because PIM-SSM is a subset of PIM-SM, existing
intradomain PIM-SM networks are automatically compatible with SSM
applications. Thus, SSM applications can operate alongside existing ASM
applications. SSM\'s benefits of simplified address management and
significantly reduced operational complexity apply equally to
intradomain use.[¶](#section-4.5-1){.pilcrow}

However, for some applications, it may be prohibitively difficult to add
support for source discovery, so intradomain ASM may still be
appropriate.[¶](#section-4.5-2){.pilcrow}

In the case of existing ASM applications that cannot readily be ported
to SSM, it may be possible to use some form of protocol mapping \--
i.e., to have a mechanism to translate a (\*,G) join or leave to a (S,G)
join or leave for a specific source S. The general challenge in
performing such mapping is determining where the configured source
address, S, comes from.[¶](#section-4.6-1){.pilcrow}

There are existing vendor-specific mechanisms deployed that achieve this
function, but none are documented in IETF documents. This may be a
useful area for the IETF to work on as an interim transition mechanism.
However, these mechanisms would introduce additional administrative
burdens, along with the need for some form of address management,
neither of which are required in SSM. Hence, this should not be
considered a long-term solution.[¶](#section-4.6-2){.pilcrow}

A key benefit of SSM is that the receiver specifies the source-group
tuple when signaling interest in a multicast stream. Hence, the group
address need not be globally unique, so there is no need for multicast
address allocation as long the reserved SSM range is
used.[¶](#section-4.7-1){.pilcrow}

Despite the deprecation of interdomain ASM, it is recommended that
operators not filter ASM group ranges at domain boundaries, as some form
of ASM-SSM mappings may continue to be used for some
time.[¶](#section-4.7-2){.pilcrow}

### [4.8.](#section-4.8){.section-number .selfRef} [Not Precluding Intradomain ASM](#name-not-precluding-intradomain-){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-not-precluding-intradomain-}

The use of ASM within a single multicast domain such as a campus or
enterprise is still relatively common today. There are even global
enterprise networks that have successfully been using PIM-SM for many
years. The operators of such networks most often use Anycast-RP
\[[RFC4610](#RFC4610){.xref}\] or MSDP (with IPv4) for RP resilience, at
the expense of the extra operational complexity. These existing
practices are unaffected by this document.[¶](#section-4.8-1){.pilcrow}

In the past decade, some BIDIR-PIM deployments have scaled interdomain
ASM deployments beyond the capabilities of PIM-SM. This, too, is
unaffected by this document; instead, it is encouraged where necessary
due to application requirements (see [Section
4.4](#guidance){.xref}).[¶](#section-4.8-2){.pilcrow}

This document also does not preclude continued use of ASM with multiple
PIM-SM domains inside organizations, such as with IPv4 MSDP or IPv6
Embedded-RP. This includes organizations that are federations and have
appropriate, nonstandardized mechanisms to deal with the interdomain ASM
issues explained in [Section

Existing PIM-SM deployments can usually be used to run SSM applications
with few-to-no changes. In some widely available router implementations
of PIM-SM, PIM-SSM is simply enabled by default in the designated SSM
address spaces whenever PIM-SM is enabled. In other implementations,
simple configuration options exist to enable it. This allows migration
of ASM applications to SSM/PIM-SSM solely through application-side
development to handle source-signaling via IGMPv3/MLDv2 and using SSM
addresses. No network actions are required for this transition;
unchanged ASM applications can continue to coexist without
issues.[¶](#section-4.9-1){.pilcrow}

When running PIM-SM, IGMPv3/MLDv2 (S,G) membership reports may also
result in the desired PIM-SSM (S,G) operations and bypass any RP
procedures. This is not standardized but depends on implementation and
may require additional configuration in available products. In general,
it is recommended to always use SSM address space for SSM applications.
For example, the interaction of IGMPv3/MLDv2 (S,G) membership reports
and BIDIR-PIM is undefined and may not result in forwarding of any
traffic.[¶](#section-4.9-2){.pilcrow}

Note that these migration recommendations do not include considerations
on when or how to evolve those intradomain applications best served by
ASM/BIDIR-PIM from PIM-SM to BIDIR-PIM. This may also be important but
is outside the scope of this document.[¶](#section-4.9-3){.pilcrow}
