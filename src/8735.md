# Scenarios and Simulation Results of PCE in a Native IP Network {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

Requirements for providing the End-to-End (E2E) performance assurance
are emerging within the service provider networks. While there are
various technology solutions, there is no single solution that can
fulfill these requirements for a native IP network. In particular, there
is a need for a universal E2E solution that can cover both intra- and
inter-domain scenarios.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

One feasible E2E traffic-engineering solution is the addition of central
control in a native IP network. This document describes various complex
scenarios and simulation results when applying the Path Computation
Element (PCE) in a native IP network. This solution, referred to as
Centralized Control Dynamic Routing (CCDR), integrates the advantage of
using distributed protocols and the power of a centralized control
technology, providing traffic engineering for native IP networks in a
manner that applies equally to intra- and inter-domain
scenarios.[¶](#section-abstract-2){.pilcrow}

A service provider network is composed of thousands of routers that run
distributed protocols to exchange reachability information. The path for
the destination network is mainly calculated, and controlled, by the
distributed protocols. These distributed protocols are robust enough to
support most applications; however, they have some difficulties
supporting the complexities needed for traffic-engineering applications,
e.g., E2E performance assurance, or maximizing the link utilization
within an IP network.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) using Traffic-Engineering (TE)
technology (MPLS-TE) \[[RFC3209](#RFC3209){.xref}\] is one solution for
TE networks, but it introduces an MPLS network along with related
technology, which would be an overlay of the IP network. MPLS-TE
technology is often used for Label Switched Path (LSP) protection and
setting up complex paths within a domain. It has not been widely
deployed for meeting E2E (especially in inter-domain) dynamic
performance assurance requirements for an IP
network.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

Segment Routing \[[RFC8402](#RFC8402){.xref}\] is another solution that
integrates some advantages of using a distributed protocol and central
control technology, but it requires the underlying network, especially
the provider edge router, to do an in-depth label push and pop action
while adding complexity when coexisting with the non-segment routing
network. Additionally, it can only maneuver the E2E paths for MPLS and
IPv6 traffic via different mechanisms.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

Deterministic Networking (DetNet) \[[RFC8578](#RFC8578){.xref}\] is
another possible solution. It is primarily focused on providing bounded
latency for a flow and introduces additional requirements on the domain
edge router. The current DetNet scope is within one domain. The use
cases defined in this document do not require the additional complexity
of deterministic properties and so differ from the DetNet use
cases.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

This document describes several scenarios for a native IP network where
a Centralized Control Dynamic Routing (CCDR) framework can produce
qualitative improvement in efficiency without requiring a change to the
data-plane behavior on the router. Using knowledge of the Border Gateway
Protocol (BGP) session-specific prefixes advertised by a router, the
network topology and the near-real-time link-utilization information
from network management systems, a central PCE is able to compute an
optimal path and give the underlying routers the destination address to
use to reach the BGP nexthop, such that the distributed routing protocol
will use the computed path via traditional recursive lookup procedure.
Some results from simulations of path optimization are also presented to
concretely illustrate a variety of scenarios where CCDR shows
significant improvement over traditional distributed routing
protocols.[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}

This document is the base document of the following two documents: the

With the emergence of cloud computing technologies, enterprises are
putting more and more services on a public-oriented cloud environment
while keeping core business within their private cloud. The
communication between the private and public cloud sites spans the WAN.
The bandwidth requirements between them are variable, and the background
traffic between these two sites varies over time. Enterprise
applications require assurance of the E2E QoS performance on demand for
variable bandwidth services.[¶](#section-3.1-1){.pilcrow}

CCDR, which integrates the merits of distributed protocols and the power
of centralized control, is suitable for this scenario. The possible
solution framework is illustrated below:[¶](#section-3.1-2){.pilcrow}

As illustrated in [Figure 1](#hybrid-cloud-comm){.xref}, the source and
destination of the \"Cloud-Based Application\" traffic are located at
\"Private Cloud Site\" and \"Public Cloud Site\",
respectively.[¶](#section-3.1-4){.pilcrow}

By default, the traffic path between the private and public cloud site
is determined by the distributed control network. When an application
requires E2E QoS assurance, it can send these requirements to the PCE
and let the PCE compute one E2E path, which is based on the underlying
network topology and real traffic information, in order to accommodate
the application\'s QoS requirements. [Section 4.4](#Section-4.4){.xref}

Network topology within a Metro Area Network (MAN) is generally in a
star mode as illustrated in [Figure 2](#star-mode-man){.xref}, with
different devices connected to different customer types. The traffic
from these customers is often in a tidal pattern with the links between
the Core Router (CR) / Broadband Remote Access Server (BRAS) and
CR/Service Router (SR) experiencing congestion in different periods due
to subscribers under BRAS often using the network at night and the
leased line users under SR often using the network during the daytime.
The link between BRAS/SR and CR must satisfy the maximum traffic volume
between them, respectively, which causes these links to often be
underutilized.[¶](#section-3.2-1){.pilcrow}

Service provider networks are often comprised of different domains,
interconnected with each other, forming a very complex topology as
illustrated in [Figure 4](#te-topology){.xref}. Due to the traffic
pattern to/from the MAN and IDC, the utilization of the links between
them are often asymmetric. It is almost impossible to balance the
utilization of these links via a distributed protocol, but this
unbalance can be overcome utilizing the CCDR

A solution for this scenario requires the gathering of NetFlow
information, analysis of the source/destination autonomous system (AS),
and determining what the main cause of the congested link(s) is. After
this, the operator can use the external Border Gateway Protocol (eBGP)
sessions to schedule the traffic among the different domains according
to the solution described in the CCDR
framework.[¶](#section-3.3-3){.pilcrow}

### [3.4.](#section-3.4){.section-number .selfRef} [Network Temporal Congestion Elimination](#name-network-temporal-congestion){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-network-temporal-congestion}

In more general situations, there is often temporal congestion within
the service provider\'s network, for example, due to daily or weekly
periodic bursts or large events that are scheduled well in advance. Such
congestion phenomena often appear regularly, and if the service provider
has methods to mitigate it, it will certainly improve their network
operation capabilities and increase satisfaction for customers. CCDR is
also suitable for such scenarios, as the controller can schedule traffic
out of the congested links, lowering their utilization during these
times. [Section 4.5](#Section-4.5){.xref} describes the simulation

The following sections describe a specific case study to illustrate the
workings of the CCDR algorithm with concrete paths/metrics, as well as a
procedure for generating topology and traffic matrices and the results
from simulations applying CCDR for E2E QoS (assured path and congestion
elimination) over the generated topologies and traffic matrices. In all
cases examined, the CCDR algorithm produces qualitatively significant
improvement over the reference (OSPF) algorithm, suggesting that CCDR
will have broad applicability.[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

The structure and scale of the simulated topology is similar to that of
the real networks. Multiple different traffic matrices were generated to
simulate different congestion conditions in the network. Only one of
them is illustrated since the others produce similar
results.[¶](#section-4-2){.pilcrow}

In this section, we consider a specific network topology for case study:
examining the path selected by OSPF and CCDR and evaluating how and why
the paths differ. [Figure 5](#ccdr-algo){.xref} depicts the topology of
the network in this case. There are eight forwarding devices in the
network. The original cost and utilization are marked on it as shown in
the figure. For example, the original cost and utilization for the link
(1, 2) are 3 and 50%, respectively. There are two flows: f1 and f2. Both
of these two flows are from node 1 to node 8. For simplicity, it is
assumed that the bandwidth of the link in the network is 10 Mb/s. The
flow rate of f1 is 1 Mb/s and the flow rate of f2 is 2 Mb/s. The
threshold of the link in congestion is 90%.[¶](#section-4.1-1){.pilcrow}

If the OSPF protocol, which adopts Dijkstra\'s algorithm (IS-IS is
similar because it also uses Dijkstra\'s algorithm), is applied in the
network, the two flows from node 1 to node 8 can only use the OSPF path
(p1: 1-\>2-\>3-\>8). This is because Dijkstra\'s algorithm mainly
considers the original cost of the link. Since CCDR considers cost and
utilization simultaneously, the same path as OSPF will not be selected
due to the severe congestion of the link (2, 3). In this case, f1 will
select the path (p2: 1-\>5-\>6-\>7-\>8) since the new cost of this path
is better than that of the OSPF path. Moreover, the path p2 is also
better than the path (p3: 1-\>2-\>4-\>7-\>8) for flow f1. However, f2
will not select the same path since it will cause new congestion in the
link (6, 7). As a result, f2 will select the path (p3:
1-\>2-\>4-\>7-\>8).[¶](#section-4.1-2){.pilcrow}

Moving on from the specific case study, we now consider a class of
networks more representative of real deployments, with a fully linked
core network that serves to connect edge nodes, which themselves connect
to only a subset of the core. An example of such a topology is shown in
[Figure 6](#top-sim){.xref} for the case of 4 core nodes and 5 edge
nodes. The CCDR simulations presented in this work use topologies
involving 100 core nodes and 400 edge nodes. While the resulting graph
does not fit on this page, this scale of network is similar to what is
deployed in production environments.[¶](#section-4.2-1){.pilcrow}

For the simulations, the number of links connecting one edge node to the
set of core nodes is randomly chosen between two and thirty, and the
total number of links is more than 20,000. Each link has a congestion
threshold, which can be arbitrarily set, for example, to 90% of the
nominal link capacity without affecting the simulation
results.[¶](#section-4.2-3){.pilcrow}

For each topology, a traffic matrix is generated based on the link
capacity of the topology. It can result in many kinds of situations such
as congestion, mild congestion, and
non-congestion.[¶](#section-4.3-1){.pilcrow}

In the CCDR simulation, the dimension of the traffic matrix is 500\*500
(100 core nodes plus 400 edge nodes). About 20% of links are overloaded
when the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol is used in the
network.[¶](#section-4.3-2){.pilcrow}

The CCDR E2E path optimization entails finding the best path, which is
the lowest in metric value, as well as having utilization far below the
congestion threshold for each link of the path. Based on the current
state of the network, the PCE within CCDR framework combines the
shortest path algorithm with a penalty theory of classical optimization
and graph theory.[¶](#section-4.4-1){.pilcrow}

Given a background traffic matrix, which is unscheduled, when a set of
new flows comes into the network, the E2E path optimization finds the
optimal paths for them. The selected paths bring the least congestion
degree to the network.[¶](#section-4.4-2){.pilcrow}

The link Utilization Increment Degree (UID), when the new flows are
added into the network, is shown in [Figure
7](#sim-congestion-elimination){.xref}. The first graph in [Figure
7](#sim-congestion-elimination){.xref} is the UID with OSPF, and the
second graph is the UID with CCDR E2E path optimization. The average UID
of the first graph is more than 30%. After path optimization, the
average UID is less than 5%. The results show that the CCDR E2E path
optimization has an eye-catching decrease in UID relative to the path
chosen based on OSPF.[¶](#section-4.4-3){.pilcrow}

While real-world results invariably differ from simulations (for
example, real-world topologies are likely to exhibit correlation in the
attachment patterns for edge nodes to the core, which are not reflected
in these results), the dramatic nature of the improvement in UID and the
choice of simulated topology to resemble real-world conditions suggest
that real-world deployments will also experience significant improvement
in UID results.[¶](#section-4.4-4){.pilcrow}

During the simulations, different degrees of network congestion were
considered. To examine the effect of CCDR on link congestion, we
consider the Congestion Degree (CD) of a link, defined as the link
utilization beyond its threshold.[¶](#section-4.5-1){.pilcrow}

The CCDR congestion elimination performance is shown in [Figure
8](#sim-congestion-elimination-2){.xref}. The first graph is the CD
distribution before the process of congestion elimination. The average
CD of all congested links is about 20%. The second graph shown in
[Figure 8](#sim-congestion-elimination-2){.xref} is the CD distribution
after using the congestion elimination process. It shows that only
twelve links among the total 20,000 exceed the threshold, and all the CD
values are less than 3%. Thus, after scheduling the traffic away from
the congested paths, the degree of network congestion is greatly
eliminated and the network utilization is in
balance.[¶](#section-4.5-2){.pilcrow}

Elimination](#name-simulation-results-with-cong){.selfRef}
:::

It is clear that by using an active path-computation mechanism that is
able to take into account observed link traffic/congestion, the
occurrence of congestion events can be greatly reduced. Only when a
preponderance of links in the network are near their congestion
threshold will the central controller be unable to find a clear path as
opposed to when a static metric-based procedure is used, which will
produce congested paths once a single bottleneck approaches its
capacity. More detailed information about the algorithm can be found in
\[[PTCS](#PTCS){.xref}\].[¶](#section-4.5-4){.pilcrow}

## [5.](#section-5){.section-number .selfRef} [CCDR Deployment Consideration](#name-ccdr-deployment-considerati){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-ccdr-deployment-considerati}

The above CCDR scenarios and simulation results demonstrate that a
single general solution can be found that copes with multiple complex
situations. The specific situations considered are not known to have any
special properties, so it is expected that the benefits demonstrated
will have general applicability. Accordingly, the integrated use of a
centralized controller for the more complex optimal path computations in
a native IP network should result in significant improvements without
impacting the underlying network
infrastructure.[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

For intra-domain or inter-domain native IP TE scenarios, the deployment
of a CCDR solution is similar with the centralized controller being able
to compute paths along with no changes being required to the underlying
network infrastructure. This universal deployment characteristic can
facilitate a generic traffic-engineering solution where operators do not
need to differentiate between intra-domain and inter-domain TE
cases.[¶](#section-5-2){.pilcrow}

To deploy the CCDR solution, the PCE should collect the underlying
network topology dynamically, for example, via Border Gateway Protocol -
Link State (BGP-LS) \[[RFC7752](#RFC7752){.xref}\]. It also needs to
gather the network traffic information periodically from the network
management platform. The simulation results show that the PCE can
compute the E2E optimal path within seconds; thus, it can cope with a
change to the underlying network in a matter of minutes. More agile
requirements would need to increase the sample rate of the underlying
network and decrease the detection and notification interval of the
underlying network. The methods of gathering this information as well as
decreasing its latency are out of the scope of this
document.[¶](#section-5-3){.pilcrow}

## [6.](#section-6){.section-number .selfRef} [Security Considerations](#name-security-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-security-considerations}

This document considers mainly the integration of distributed protocols
and the central control capability of a PCE. While it can certainly
simplify the management of a network in various traffic-engineering
scenarios as described in this document, the centralized control also
brings a new point that may be easily attacked. Solutions for CCDR
scenarios need to consider protection of the PCE and communication with
the underlying devices.[¶](#section-6-1){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC5440](#RFC5440){.xref}\] and \[[RFC8253](#RFC8253){.xref}\]
provide additional information.[¶](#section-6-2){.pilcrow}

The control priority and interaction process should also be carefully
designed for the combination of the distributed protocol and central
control. Generally, the central control instructions should have higher
priority than the forwarding actions determined by the distributed
protocol. When communication between PCE and the underlying devices is
disrupted, the distributed protocol should take control of the
underlying network.
\[[PCE-NATIVE-IP](#I-D.ietf-teas-pce-native-ip){.xref}\] provides more
considerations corresponding to the solution.[¶](#section-6-3){.pilcrow}
