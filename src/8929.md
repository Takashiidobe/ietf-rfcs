# IPv6 Backbone Router {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

This document updates RFCs 6775 and 8505 in order to enable proxy
services for IPv6 Neighbor Discovery by Routing Registrars called
\"Backbone Routers\". Backbone Routers are placed along the wireless
edge of a backbone and federate multiple wireless links to form a single
Multi-Link Subnet (MLSN).[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

Ethernet bridging per IEEE Std 802.1
\[[IEEEstd8021Q](#IEEEstd8021Q){.xref}\] provides an efficient and
reliable broadcast service for wired networks; applications and
protocols have been built that heavily depend on that feature for their
core operation. Unfortunately, Low-Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) and
local wireless networks generally do not provide the broadcast
capabilities of Ethernet bridging in an economical
fashion.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

As a result, protocols designed for bridged networks that rely on
multicast and broadcast often exhibit disappointing behaviors when
employed unmodified on a local wireless medium (see
\[[MCAST-PROBLEMS](#I-D.ietf-mboned-ieee802-mcast-problems){.xref}\]).[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

Wi-Fi \[[IEEEstd80211](#IEEEstd80211){.xref}\] Access Points (APs)
deployed in an Extended Service Set (ESS) act as Ethernet bridges
\[[IEEEstd8021Q](#IEEEstd8021Q){.xref}\], with the property that the
bridging state is established at the time of association. This ensures
connectivity to the end node (the Wi-Fi Station (STA)) and protects the
wireless medium against broadcast-intensive transparent bridging
\[[IEEEstd8021Q](#IEEEstd8021Q){.xref}\] reactive lookups. In other
words, the association process is used to register the link-layer
address of the STA to the AP. The AP subsequently proxies the bridging
operation and does not need to forward the broadcast lookups over the
radio.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

In the same way as transparent bridging, the IPv6
\[[RFC8200](#RFC8200){.xref}\] Neighbor Discovery (IPv6 ND) protocol
\[[RFC4861](#RFC4861){.xref}\] \[[RFC4862](#RFC4862){.xref}\] is a
reactive protocol, based on multicast transmissions to locate an on-link
correspondent and ensure the uniqueness of an IPv6 address. The
mechanism for Duplicate Address Detection (DAD)
\[[RFC4862](#RFC4862){.xref}\] was designed for the efficient broadcast
operation of Ethernet bridging. Since broadcast can be unreliable over
wireless media, DAD often fails to discover duplications
\[[DAD-ISSUES](#I-D.yourtchenko-6man-dad-issues){.xref}\]. In practice,
the fact that IPv6 addresses very rarely conflict is mostly attributable
to the entropy of the 64-bit Interface IDs as opposed to the successful
operation of the IPv6 ND DAD and resolution
mechanisms.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

The IPv6 ND Neighbor Solicitation (NS) \[[RFC4861](#RFC4861){.xref}\]
message is used for DAD and address lookup when a node moves or wakes up
and reconnects to the wireless network. The NS message is targeted to a
Solicited-Node Multicast Address (SNMA) \[[RFC4291](#RFC4291){.xref}\]
and should, in theory, only reach a very small group of nodes. But, in
reality, IPv6 multicast messages are typically broadcast on the wireless
medium, so they are processed by most of the wireless nodes over the
subnet (e.g., the ESS fabric) regardless of how few of the nodes are
subscribed to the SNMA. As a result, IPv6 ND address lookups and DADs
over a large wireless network and/or LLN can consume enough bandwidth to
cause a substantial degradation to the unicast traffic
service.[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}

Because IPv6 ND messages sent to the SNMA group are broadcast at the
radio link layer, wireless nodes that do not belong to the SNMA group
still have to keep their radio turned on to listen to multicast NS
messages, which is a waste of energy for them. In order to reduce their
power consumption, certain battery-operated devices such as Internet of
Things (IoT) sensors and smartphones ignore some of the broadcasts,
making IPv6 ND operations even less reliable.[¶](#section-1-6){.pilcrow}

These problems can be alleviated by reducing the IPv6 ND broadcasts over
wireless access links. This has been done by splitting the broadcast
domains and routing between subnets. At the extreme, this can be done by
assigning a /64 prefix to each wireless node (see
\[[RFC8273](#RFC8273){.xref}\]). But deploying a single large subnet can
still be attractive to avoid renumbering in situations that involve
large numbers of devices and mobility within a bounded
area.[¶](#section-1-7){.pilcrow}

A way to reduce the propagation of IPv6 ND broadcast in the wireless
domain while preserving a large single subnet is to form a Multi-Link
Subnet (MLSN). Each link in the MLSN, including the backbone, is its own
broadcast domain. A key property of MLSNs is that link-local unicast
traffic, link-scope multicast, and traffic with a hop limit of 1 will
not transit to nodes in the same subnet on a different link, which is
something that may produce unexpected behavior in software that expects
a subnet to be entirely contained within a single
link.[¶](#section-1-8){.pilcrow}

This specification considers a special type of MLSN with a central
backbone that federates edge (LLN) links, with each link providing its
own protection against rogue access and tempering or replaying packets.
In particular, the use of classical IPv6 ND on the backbone requires
that the all nodes are trusted and that rogue access to the backbone is
prevented at all times (see [Section
11](#sec){.xref}).[¶](#section-1-9){.pilcrow}

In that particular topology, ND proxies can be placed at the boundary of
the edge links and the backbone to handle IPv6 ND on behalf of
Registered Nodes and to forward IPv6 packets back and forth. The ND
proxy enables the continuity of IPv6 ND operations beyond the backbone
and enables communication using Global or Unique Local Addresses between
any pair of nodes in the MLSN.[¶](#section-1-10){.pilcrow}

The 6LoWPAN Backbone Router (6BBR) is a Routing Registrar
\[[RFC8505](#RFC8505){.xref}\] that provides ND proxy services. A 6BBR
acting as a Bridging Proxy provides an ND proxy function with Layer 2
continuity and can be collocated with a Wi-Fi AP as prescribed by IEEE
Std 802.11 \[[IEEEstd80211](#IEEEstd80211){.xref}\]. A 6BBR acting as a
Routing Proxy is applicable to any type of LLN, including LLNs that
cannot be bridged onto the backbone, such as IEEE Std 802.15.4
\[[IEEEstd802154](#IEEEstd802154){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-11){.pilcrow}

Knowledge of which address to proxy can be obtained by snooping the IPv6
ND protocol (see \[[SAVI-WLAN](#I-D.bi-savi-wlan){.xref}\]), but it has
been found to be unreliable. An IPv6 address may not be discovered
immediately due to a packet loss or if a \"silent\" node is not
currently using one of its addresses. A change of state (e.g., due to
movement) may be missed or misordered, leading to unreliable
connectivity and incomplete knowledge of the state of the
network.[¶](#section-1-12){.pilcrow}

With this specification, the address to be proxied is signaled
explicitly through a registration process. A 6LoWPAN Node (6LN)
registers all of its IPv6 addresses using NS messages with an Extended
Address Registration Option (EARO) as specified in
\[[RFC8505](#RFC8505){.xref}\] to a 6LoWPAN Router (6LR) to which it is
directly attached. If the 6LR is a 6BBR, then the 6LN is both the
Registered Node and the Registering Node. If not, then the 6LoWPAN
Border Router (6LBR) that serves the LLN proxies the registration to the
6BBR. In that case, the 6LN is the Registered Node and the 6LBR is the
Registering Node. The 6BBR performs IPv6 ND operations on its backbone
interface on behalf of the 6LNs that have Registered Addresses on its
LLN interfaces, without the need of a broadcast over the wireless
medium.[¶](#section-1-13){.pilcrow}

A Registering Node that resides on the backbone does not register to the
SNMA groups associated to its Registered Addresses and defers to the
6BBR to answer or preferably forward the corresponding multicast packets
to it as unicast.[¶](#section-1-14){.pilcrow}

This document introduces the following
terminology:[¶](#section-2.2-1){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

Federated:
:   A subnet that comprises a backbone, and one or more (wireless)
    access links, is said to be federated into one MLSN. The ND proxy
    operation of 6BBRs over the backbone extends IPv6 ND operation over
    the access links.[¶](#section-2.2-2.2){.pilcrow}
:   

Sleep Proxy:
:   A 6BBR acts as a Sleep Proxy if it answers IPv6 ND NSs over the
    backbone on behalf of the Registering Node that is in a sleep state
    and that cannot answer in due time.[¶](#section-2.2-2.4){.pilcrow}
:   

Routing Proxy:
:   A Routing Proxy provides IPv6 ND proxy functions and enables the
    MLSN operation over federated links that may not be compatible for
    bridging. The Routing Proxy advertises its own link-layer address as
    the Target Link-Layer Address (TLLA) in the proxied Neighbor
    Advertisements (NAs) over the backbone and routes at the network
    layer between the federated links.[¶](#section-2.2-2.6){.pilcrow}
:   

Bridging Proxy:
:   A Bridging Proxy provides IPv6 ND proxy functions while preserving
    forwarding continuity at the link layer. In that case, the
    link-layer address and the mobility of the Registering Node is
    visible across the bridged backbone. The Bridging Proxy advertises
    the link-layer address of the Registering Node in the TLLAO in the
    proxied NAs over the backbone, and it proxies ND for all unicast
    addresses including link-local addresses. Instead of replying on
    behalf of the Registering Node, a Bridging Proxy will preferably
    forward the NS(Lookup) and Neighbor Unreachability Detection (NUD)
    messages that target the Registered Address to the Registering Node
    as unicast frames, so it can respond in its
    own.[¶](#section-2.2-2.8){.pilcrow}
:   

Binding Table:
:   The Binding Table is an abstract database that is maintained by the
    6BBR to store the state associated with its
    registrations.[¶](#section-2.2-2.10){.pilcrow}
:   

Binding:
:   A Binding is an abstract state associated to one registration; in
    other words, it\'s associated to one entry in the Binding
    Table.[¶](#section-2.2-2.12){.pilcrow}

The LLN may be a hub-and-spoke access link such as (Low-Power) IEEE Std
802.11 (Wi-Fi) \[[IEEEstd80211](#IEEEstd80211){.xref}\] and IEEE Std
802.15.1 (Bluetooth) \[[IEEEstd802151](#IEEEstd802151){.xref}\] or a
mesh-under or a route-over network \[[RFC8505](#RFC8505){.xref}\]. The
proxy state can be distributed across multiple 6BBRs attached to the
same backbone.[¶](#section-3-4){.pilcrow}

The main features of a 6BBR are as follows:[¶](#section-3-5){.pilcrow}

-   [MLSN functions (provided by the 6BBR on the backbone) performed on
    behalf of Registered
    Nodes[¶](#section-3-6.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-6.1}

        mobility[¶](#section-3-6.2.2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-6.2.2.2}
    :::

Each Backbone Router (6BBR) maintains a data structure for its
Registered Addresses called a Binding Table. The abstract data that is
stored in the Binding Table includes the Registered Address; anchor
information on the Registering Node such as the connecting interface,
link-local address, and link-layer address (LLA) of the Registering Node
on that interface; the EARO including ROVR and TID; a state that can be
either Reachable, Tentative, or Stale; and other information such as a
trust level that may be configured, e.g., to protect a server. The
combined Binding Tables of all the 6BBRs on a backbone form a
distributed database of Registered Nodes that reside in the LLNs or on
the IPv6 Backbone.[¶](#section-3-7){.pilcrow}

Unless otherwise configured, a 6BBR does the
following:[¶](#section-3-8){.pilcrow}

-   [Creates a new entry in a Binding Table for a newly Registered
    Address and ensures that the address is not duplicated over the
    backbone.[¶](#section-3-9.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-9.1}

-   [Advertises a Registered Address over the backbone using an NA
    message as either unsolicited or a response to an NS message. This
    includes joining the multicast group associated to the SNMA derived
    from the Registered Address, as specified in [Section
    7.2.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4861#section-7.2.1){.relref}
    of \[[RFC4861](#RFC4861){.xref}\], over the
    backbone.[¶](#section-3-9.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-9.2}

-   ::: {#section-3-9.3}
    The 6BBR [MAY]{.bcp14} respond immediately as a proxy in lieu of the
    Registering Node, e.g., if the Registering Node has a sleep cycle
    that the 6BBR does not want to interrupt or if the 6BBR has a recent
    state that is deemed fresh enough to permit the proxied response. It
    is preferred, though, that the 6BBR checks whether the Registering
    Node is still responsive on the Registered Address. To that
    effect:[¶](#section-3-9.3.1){.pilcrow}

    []{.break}

    \- as a Bridging Proxy:
    :   the 6BBR forwards the multicast DAD and address lookup messages
        as a unicast link-layer frame to the link-layer address of the
        Registering Node that matches the target in the ND message; the
        Neighbor Unreachability Detection (NUD) message is unicast and
        is forwarded as is. In all cases, the goal is to let the
        Registering Node answer with the ND Message and options that it
        sees fit.[¶](#section-3-9.3.2.2){.pilcrow}
    :   

    \- as a Routing Proxy:
    :   the 6BBR checks the liveliness of the Registering Node, e.g.,
        using a NUD verification, before answering on its
        behalf.[¶](#section-3-9.3.2.4){.pilcrow}
    :   
    :::

-   [Delivers packets arriving from the LLN, using Neighbor Solicitation
    messages to look up the destination over the
    backbone.[¶](#section-3-9.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-9.4}

-   [Forwards or bridges packets between the LLN and the
    backbone.[¶](#section-3-9.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-9.5}

-   [Verifies liveness for a registration, when
    needed.[¶](#section-3-9.6){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-9.6}

The first of these functions enables the 6BBR to fulfill its role as a
Routing Registrar for each of its attached LLNs. The remaining functions
fulfill the role of the 6BBRs as the border routers that federate the
Multi-Link IPv6 Subnet.[¶](#section-3-10){.pilcrow}

The operation of IPv6 ND and ND proxy are not mutually exclusive on the
backbone, meaning that nodes attached to the backbone and using IPv6 ND
can transparently interact with 6LNs that rely on a 6BBR to ND proxy for
them, whether the 6LNs are reachable over an LLN or directly attached to
the backbone.[¶](#section-3-11){.pilcrow}

The registration mechanism \[[RFC8505](#RFC8505){.xref}\] used to learn
addresses to be proxied may coexist in a 6BBR with a proprietary
snooping or the traditional bridging functionality of an AP, in order to
support legacy LLN nodes that do not support this
specification.[¶](#section-3-12){.pilcrow}

The registration to a proxy service uses an NS/NA exchange with EARO.
The 6BBR operation resembles that of a Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6)
\[[RFC6275](#RFC6275){.xref}\] Home Agent (HA). The combination of a
6BBR and a MIPv6 HA enables full mobility support for 6LNs, inside and
outside the links that form the subnet.[¶](#section-3-13){.pilcrow}

6BBRs perform IPv6 ND functions over the backbone as
follows:[¶](#section-3-14){.pilcrow}

-   [The EARO \[[RFC8505](#RFC8505){.xref}\] is used in IPv6 ND
    exchanges over the backbone between the 6BBRs to help distinguish
    duplication from movement. Extended Duplicate Address Messages (EDAR
    and EDAC) may also be used to communicate with a 6LBR, if one is
    present. Address duplication is detected using the ROVR field.
    Conflicting registrations to different 6BBRs for the same Registered
    Address are resolved using the TID field, which forms an order of
    registrations.[¶](#section-3-15.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-15.1}
-   [The LLA that the 6BBR advertises for the Registered Address on
    behalf of the Registered Node over the backbone can belong to the
    Registering Node; in that case, the 6BBR (acting as a Bridging Proxy
    (see [Section 8](#bridge_proxy){.xref})) bridges the unicast
    packets. Alternatively, the LLA can be that of the 6BBR on the
    backbone interface, in which case, the 6BBR (acting as a Routing
    Proxy (see [Section 7](#rtr_proxy){.xref})) receives the unicast
    packets at Layer 3 and routes
    over.[¶](#section-3-15.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-15.2}

### [3.1.](#section-3.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Updating RFCs 6775 and 8505](#name-updating-rfcs-6775-and-8505){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-updating-rfcs-6775-and-8505}

This specification adds the EARO as a possible option in RS, NS(DAD),
and NA messages over the backbone. This document specifies the use of
those ND messages by 6BBRs over the backbone, at a high level in
[Section 6](#bbrbb){.xref} and in more detail in [Section
9](#crea){.xref}.[¶](#section-3.1-1){.pilcrow}

Note: \[[RFC8505](#RFC8505){.xref}\] requires that the registration
NS(EARO) contain a Source Link-Layer Address Option (SLLAO).
\[[RFC4862](#RFC4862){.xref}\] requires that the NS(DAD) be sent from
the unspecified address for which there cannot be an SLLAO.
Consequently, an NS(DAD) cannot be confused with a
registration.[¶](#section-3.1-2.1){.pilcrow}

This specification allows the deployment of a 6LBR on the backbone where
EDAR and EDAC messages coexist with classical ND. It also adds the
capability to insert IPv6 ND options in the EDAR and EDAC messages. A
6BBR acting as a 6LR for the Registered Address can insert an SLLAO in
the EDAR to the 6LBR in order to avoid causing a multicast NS(lookup)
back. This enables the 6LBR to store the link-layer address associated
with the Registered Address on a link and to serve as a mapping server
as described in
\[[UNICAST-LOOKUP](#I-D.thubert-6lo-unicast-lookup){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3.1-3){.pilcrow}

This specification allows an address to be registered to more than one
6BBR. Consequently, a 6LBR that is deployed on the backbone
[MUST]{.bcp14} be capable of maintaining state for each of the 6BBRs
that have registered with the same TID and same
ROVR.[¶](#section-3.1-4){.pilcrow}

a Layer 3 mesh network as shown in [Figure 4](#figBackbone2){.xref}. A
so-called route-over routing protocol exposes routes between 6LRs

### [3.4.](#section-3.4){.section-number .selfRef} [The Binding Table](#name-the-binding-table){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-the-binding-table}

Addresses in an LLN that are reachable from the backbone by way of the
6BBR function must be registered to that 6BBR, using an NS(EARO) with
the R flag set \[[RFC8505](#RFC8505){.xref}\]. The 6BBR answers with an
NA(EARO) and maintains a state for the registration in an abstract
Binding Table.[¶](#section-3.4-1){.pilcrow}

An entry in the Binding Table is called a \"Binding\". A Binding may be
in Tentative, Reachable, or Stale state.[¶](#section-3.4-2){.pilcrow}

The 6BBR uses a combination of \[[RFC8505](#RFC8505){.xref}\] and IPv6
ND over the backbone to advertise the registration and avoid a
duplication. Conflicting registrations are solved by the 6BBRs
transparently to the Registering Nodes.[¶](#section-3.4-3){.pilcrow}

Only one 6LN may register a given address, but the address may be
registered to multiple 6BBRs for higher
availability.[¶](#section-3.4-4){.pilcrow}

Over the LLN, Binding Table management is as
follows:[¶](#section-3.4-5){.pilcrow}

-   [De-registrations (newer TID, same ROVR, null Lifetime) are accepted
    with a status code of 4 (\"Removed\"); the entry is

-   [Newer registrations (newer TID, same ROVR, non-null Lifetime) are
    accepted with a status code of 0 (\"Success\"); the Binding is

    may be overwritten; in other states, the Registration Lifetime timer
    is restarted, and the entry is placed in Reachable
    state.[¶](#section-3.4-6.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.4-6.2}
-   [Identical registrations (same TID, same ROVR) from the same

A Registering Node [MAY]{.bcp14} register the same address to more than
one 6BBR, in which case, the Registering Node uses the same EARO in all
the parallel registrations. On the other hand, there is no provision in
6LoWPAN ND for a 6LN (acting as Registered Node) to select its 6LBR
(acting as Registering Node), so it cannot select more than one either.
To allow for this, NS(DAD) and NA messages with an EARO received over
the backbone that indicate an identical Binding in another 6BBR (same
Registered Address, same TID, same ROVR) are silently ignored except for
the purpose of selecting the primary 6BBR for that
registration.[¶](#section-3.5-1){.pilcrow}

A 6BBR may be either primary or secondary. The primary is the 6BBR that
has the highest 64-bit Extended Unique Identifier (EUI-64) address of
all the 6BBRs that share a registration for the same Registered Address,
with the same ROVR and same Transaction ID, and the EUI-64 address is
considered an unsigned 64-bit integer. A given 6BBR can be primary for a
given address and secondary for another address, regardless of whether
or not the addresses belong to the same
6LN.[¶](#section-3.5-2){.pilcrow}

In the following sections, it is expected that an NA will be sent over
the backbone only if the node is primary or does not support the concept
of primary. More than one 6BBR claiming or defending an address
generates unwanted traffic, but there is no reachability issue since all
6BBRs provide reachability from the backbone to the
6LN.[¶](#section-3.5-3){.pilcrow}

If a Registering Node loses connectivity to its 6BBR or one of the 6BBRs
to which it registered an address, it retries the registration to the
(one or more) available 6BBR(s). When doing that, the Registering Node
[MUST]{.bcp14} increment the TID in order to force the migration of the
state to the new 6BBR and the reselection of the primary 6BBR if it is
the node that was lost.[¶](#section-3.5-4){.pilcrow}

ODAD \[[RFC4429](#RFC4429){.xref}\] specifies how an IPv6 address can be
used before completion of DAD. ODAD guarantees that this behavior will
not cause harm if the new address is a
duplicate.[¶](#section-3.6-1){.pilcrow}

Support for ODAD avoids delays in installing the Neighbor Cache Entry
(NCE) in the 6BBRs and the default router, enabling immediate
connectivity to the Registered Node. As shown in [Figure
3](#figReg2){.xref}, if the 6BBR is aware of the LLA of a router, then
the 6BBR sends a Router Solicitation (RS), using the Registered Address
as the IP Source Address, to the known router(s). The RS is sent without
an SLLAO, to avoid invalidating a preexisting NCE in the
router.[¶](#section-3.6-2){.pilcrow}

Following ODAD, the router may then send a unicast RA to the Registered
Address, and it may resolve that address using an NS(Lookup) message. In
response, the 6BBR sends an NA with an EARO and the Override flag
\[[RFC4861](#RFC4861){.xref}\] that is not set. The router can then
determine the freshest EARO in case of conflicting NA(EARO) messages,
using the method described in [Section
5.2.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8505#section-5.2.1){.relref} of
\[[RFC8505](#RFC8505){.xref}\]. If the NA(EARO) is the freshest answer,
the default router creates a Binding with the SLLAO of the 6BBR (in
Routing Proxy mode) or that of the Registering Node (in Bridging Proxy
mode), so traffic from/to the Registered Address can flow
immediately.[¶](#section-3.6-3){.pilcrow}

## [4.](#section-4){.section-number .selfRef} [Multi-Link Subnet Considerations](#name-multi-link-subnet-considera){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-multi-link-subnet-considera}

The backbone and the federated LLN links are considered to be different
links in the MLSN, even if multiple LLNs are attached to the same 6BBR.
ND messages are link-scoped and are not forwarded by the 6BBR between
the backbone and the LLNs, though some packets may be reinjected in
Bridging Proxy mode (see [Section
8](#bridge_proxy){.xref}).[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

Legacy nodes located on the backbone expect that the subnet is deployed
within a single link and that there is a common Maximum Transmission
Unit (MTU) for intra-subnet communication: the Link MTU. They will not
perform the IPv6 Path MTU Discovery \[[RFC8201](#RFC8201){.xref}\] for a
destination within the subnet. For that reason, the MTU [MUST]{.bcp14}
have the same value on the backbone and on all federated LLNs in the
MLSN. As a consequence, the 6BBR [MUST]{.bcp14} use the same MTU value
in RAs over the backbone and in the RAs that it transmits toward the LLN
links.[¶](#section-4-2){.pilcrow}

A 6LBR can be deployed to serve the whole MLSN as shown in [Figure
4](#figBackbone2){.xref}. It may be attached to the backbone, in which
case it can be discovered by its capability advertisement (see [Section
4.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8505#section-4.3){.relref} of
\[[RFC8505](#RFC8505){.xref}\]) in RA
messages.[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

When a 6LBR is present, the 6BBR uses an EDAR/EDAC message exchange with
the 6LBR to check if the new registration corresponds to a duplication
or a movement. This is done prior to the NS(DAD) process, which may be
avoided if the 6LBR already maintains a conflicting state for the
Registered Address.[¶](#section-5-2){.pilcrow}

If this registration is a duplicate or not the freshest, then the 6LBR
replies with an EDAC message with a status code of 1 (\"Duplicate
Address\") or 3 (\"Moved\"), respectively. If this registration is the
freshest, then the 6LBR replies with a status code of 0 (\"Success\").
In that case, if this registration is fresher than an existing
registration for another 6BBR, then the 6LBR also sends an asynchronous
EDAC with a status code of 4 (\"Removed\") to the older
6BBR.[¶](#section-5-3){.pilcrow}

The EDAR message [SHOULD]{.bcp14} carry the SLLAO used in NS messages by
the 6BBR for that Binding, and the EDAC message [SHOULD]{.bcp14} carry
the Target Link-Layer Address Option (TLLAO) associated with the
currently accepted registration. This enables a 6BBR to locate the new
position of a mobile 6LN in the case of a Routing Proxy operation and
opens the capability for the 6LBR to serve as a mapping server in the
future.[¶](#section-5-4){.pilcrow}

Note that if link-local addresses are registered, then the scope of
uniqueness on which the address duplication is checked is the total
collection of links that the 6LBR serves, as opposed to the sole link on
which the link-local address is assigned.[¶](#section-5-5){.pilcrow}

On the backbone side, the 6BBR [MUST]{.bcp14} join the SNMA group
corresponding to a Registered Address as soon as it creates a Binding
for that address and maintain that SNMA membership as long as it
maintains the registration. The 6BBR uses either the SNMA or plain
unicast to defend the Registered Addresses in its Binding Table over the
backbone (as specified in \[[RFC4862](#RFC4862){.xref}\]). The 6BBR
advertises and defends the Registered Addresses over the Backbone Link
using RS, NS(DAD), and NA messages with the Registered Address as the
Source or Target Address.[¶](#section-6-1){.pilcrow}

The 6BBR [MUST]{.bcp14} place an EARO in the IPv6 ND messages that it
generates on behalf of the Registered Node. Note that an NS(DAD) does
not contain an SLLAO and cannot be confused with a proxy registration
such as performed by a 6LBR.[¶](#section-6-2){.pilcrow}

This specification adds information about proxied addresses that helps
to sort out a duplication (different ROVR) from a movement (same ROVR,
different TID); in the latter case, the older registration is sorted out
from the fresher one (by comparing TIDs).[¶](#section-6-5){.pilcrow}

When a Registering Node moves from one 6BBR to the next, the 6BBRs send
NA messages over the backbone to update existing NCEs. A node that
receives multiple NA messages with an EARO option and the same ROVR
[MUST]{.bcp14} favor the NA with the freshest EARO over the
others.[¶](#section-6-6){.pilcrow}

The new 6BBR [MAY]{.bcp14} set the Override flag in the NA messages if
it does not compete with the Registering Node for the NCE in backbone
nodes. This is assured if the Registering Node is attached via an
interface that cannot be bridged onto the backbone, making it impossible
for the Registering Node to defend its own addresses there. This may
also be signaled by the Registering Node through a protocol extension
that is not in scope for this specification.[¶](#section-6-7){.pilcrow}

This behavior is specified in more detail in [Section

## [7.](#section-7){.section-number .selfRef} [Routing Proxy Operations](#name-routing-proxy-operations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-routing-proxy-operations}

A Routing Proxy provides IPv6 ND proxy functions for Global and Unique
Local Addresses between the LLN and the backbone, but not for link-local
addresses. It operates as an IPv6 border router and provides a full
link-layer isolation.[¶](#section-7-1){.pilcrow}

In this mode, it is not required that the link-layer addresses of the
6LNs be visible at Layer 2 over the backbone. Thus, it is useful when
the messaging over the backbone that is associated with wireless
mobility becomes expensive, e.g., when the Layer 2 topology is
virtualized over a wide area IP underlay.[¶](#section-7-2){.pilcrow}

This mode is definitely required when the LLN uses a link-layer address
format that is different from that on the backbone (e.g., EUI-64 versus
EUI-48). Since a 6LN may not be able to resolve an arbitrary destination
in the MLSN directly, a prefix that is used across a MLSN [MUST
NOT]{.bcp14} be advertised as on-link in RA messages sent towards the
LLN.[¶](#section-7-3){.pilcrow}

In order to maintain IP connectivity, the 6BBR installs a connected host
route to the Registered Address on the LLN interface, via the
Registering Node as identified by the source address and the SLLAO in
the NS(EARO) messages.[¶](#section-7-4){.pilcrow}

When operating as a Routing Proxy, the 6BBR [MUST]{.bcp14} use its Layer
2 address on its backbone interface in the SLLAO of the RS messages and
the TLLAO of the NA messages that it generates to advertise the
Registered Addresses.[¶](#section-7-5){.pilcrow}

For each Registered Address, multiple peers on the backbone may have
resolved the address with the 6BBR link-layer address, maintaining that
mapping in their Neighbor Cache. The 6BBR [SHOULD]{.bcp14} maintain a
list of the peers on the backbone that have associated its link-layer
address with the Registered Address. If that Registered Address moves to
another 6BBR, the previous 6BBR [SHOULD]{.bcp14} unicast a gratuitous NA
to each such peer, to supply the LLA of the new 6BBR in the TLLAO for
the address. A 6BBR that does not maintain this list [MAY]{.bcp14}
multicast a gratuitous NA message; this NA will possibly hit all the
nodes on the backbone, whether or not they maintain an NCE for the
Registered Address. In either case, the 6BBR [MAY]{.bcp14} set the
Override flag if it is known that the Registered Node cannot attach to
the backbone; this will avoid interruptions and save probing flows in
the future.[¶](#section-7-6){.pilcrow}

If a correspondent fails to receive the gratuitous NA, it will keep
sending traffic to a 6BBR to which the node was previously registered.
Since the previous 6BBR removed its host route to the Registered
Address, it will look up the address over the backbone, resolve the
address with the LLA of the new 6BBR, and forward the packet to the
correct 6BBR. The previous 6BBR [SHOULD]{.bcp14} also issue a redirect
message \[[RFC4861](#RFC4861){.xref}\] to update the cache of the
correspondent.[¶](#section-7-7){.pilcrow}

## [8.](#section-8){.section-number .selfRef} [Bridging Proxy Operations](#name-bridging-proxy-operations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-bridging-proxy-operations}

A Bridging Proxy provides IPv6 ND proxy functions between the LLN and
the backbone while preserving the forwarding continuity at the link
layer. It acts as a Layer 2 bridge for all types of unicast packets
including link-scoped, and it appears as an IPv6 Host on the
backbone.[¶](#section-8-1){.pilcrow}

The Bridging Proxy registers any Binding, including a link-local address
to the 6LBR (if present), and defends it over the backbone in IPv6 ND
procedures.[¶](#section-8-2){.pilcrow}

To achieve this, the Bridging Proxy intercepts the IPv6 ND messages and
may reinject them on the other side, respond directly, or drop them. For
instance, an NS(Lookup) from the backbone that matches a Binding can be
responded to directly or turned into a unicast on the LLN side to let
the 6LN respond.[¶](#section-8-3){.pilcrow}

As a Bridging Proxy, the 6BBR [MUST]{.bcp14} use the Registering Node\'s
Layer 2 address in the SLLAO of the NS/RS messages and the TLLAO of the
NA messages that it generates to advertise the Registered Addresses. The
Registering Node\'s Layer 2 address is found in the SLLAO of the
registration NS(EARO) and maintained in the Binding
Table.[¶](#section-8-4){.pilcrow}

The MLSN prefix [SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} be advertised as on-link in RA
messages sent towards the LLN. If a destination address is seen as
on-link, then a 6LN may use NS(Lookup) messages to resolve that address.
In that case, the 6BBR [MUST]{.bcp14} either answer the NS(Lookup)
message directly or reinject the message on the backbone, as either a
Layer 2 unicast or a multicast.[¶](#section-8-5){.pilcrow}

If the Registering Node owns the Registered Address, meaning that the
Registering Node is the Registered Node, then its mobility does not
impact existing NCEs over the backbone. In a network where proxy
registrations are used, meaning that the Registering Node acts on behalf
of the Registered Node, if the Registered Node selects a new Registering
Node, then the existing NCEs across the backbone pointing at the old
Registering Node must be updated. In that case, the 6BBR
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} attempt to fix the existing NCEs across the backbone
pointing at other 6BBRs using NA messages as described in [Section
7](#rtr_proxy){.xref}.[¶](#section-8-6){.pilcrow}

This method can fail if the multicast message is not received; one or
more correspondent nodes on the backbone might maintain a stale NCE, and
packets to the Registered Address may be lost. When this condition
happens, it is eventually discovered and resolved using NUD as defined
in \[[RFC4861](#RFC4861){.xref}\].[¶](#section-8-7){.pilcrow}

Upon receiving a registration for a new address (i.e., an NS(EARO) with
the R flag set), the 6BBR creates a Binding and operates as a 6LR
according to \[[RFC8505](#RFC8505){.xref}\], interacting with the 6LBR
if one is present.[¶](#section-9-1){.pilcrow}

An implementation of a Routing Proxy that creates a Binding
[MUST]{.bcp14} also create an associated host route pointing to the
Registering Node in the LLN interface from which the registration was
received.[¶](#section-9-2){.pilcrow}

Acting as a 6BBR, the 6LR operation is modified as
follows:[¶](#section-9-3){.pilcrow}

-   [Acting as a Bridging Proxy, the 6LR [MUST]{.bcp14} ND proxy over
    the backbone for registered link-local
    addresses.[¶](#section-9-4.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-9-4.1}
-   [EDAR and EDAC messages [SHOULD]{.bcp14} carry an SLLAO and a TLLAO,
    respectively.[¶](#section-9-4.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-9-4.2}
-   [An EDAC message with a status code of 9 (\"6LBR Registry
    Saturated\") is assimilated as a status code of 0 (\"Success\") if a
    following DAD process protects the address against
    duplication.[¶](#section-9-4.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-9-4.3}

This specification enables nodes on a Backbone Link to coexist along
with nodes implementing IPv6 ND \[[RFC4861](#RFC4861){.xref}\] as well
as other non-normative specifications such as
\[[SAVI-WLAN](#I-D.bi-savi-wlan){.xref}\]. It is possible that not all
IPv6 addresses on the backbone are registered and known to the 6LBR, and
an EDAR/EDAC exchange with the 6LBR might succeed even for a duplicate
address. Consequently, the 6BBR still needs to perform IPv6 ND DAD over
the backbone after an EDAC with a status code of 0 (\"Success\") or 9
(\"6LBR Registry Saturated\").[¶](#section-9-5){.pilcrow}

For the DAD operation, the Binding is placed in Tentative state for a
duration of TENTATIVE_DURATION ([Section 12](#const){.xref}), and an
NS(DAD) message is sent as a multicast message over the backbone to the
SNMA associated with the Registered Address
\[[RFC4862](#RFC4862){.xref}\]. The EARO from the registration
[MUST]{.bcp14} be placed unchanged in the NS(DAD)
message.[¶](#section-9-6){.pilcrow}

If a registration is received for an existing Binding with a non-null
Registration Lifetime and the registration is fresher (same ROVR,
fresher TID), then the Binding is updated with the new Registration
Lifetime, TID, and possibly Registering Node. In Tentative state (see
[Section 9.1](#tent){.xref}), the current DAD operation continues
unaltered. In other states (see Sections [9.2](#defend){.xref} and
[9.3](#stale){.xref} ), the Binding is placed in Reachable state for the
Registration Lifetime, and the 6BBR returns an NA(EARO) to the
Registering Node with a status code of 0
(\"Success\").[¶](#section-9-7){.pilcrow}

Upon a registration that is identical (same ROVR, TID, and Registering
Node), the 6BBR does not alter its current state. In Reachable state, it
returns an NA(EARO) back to the Registering Node with a status code of 0
(\"Success\"). A registration that is not as fresh (same ROVR, older
TID) is ignored.[¶](#section-9-8){.pilcrow}

If a registration is received for an existing Binding and a Registration
Lifetime of 0, then the Binding is removed, and the 6BBR returns an
NA(EARO) back to the Registering Node with a status code of 0
(\"Success\"). An implementation of a Routing Proxy that removes a
Binding [MUST]{.bcp14} remove the associated host route pointing on the
Registering Node.[¶](#section-9-9){.pilcrow}

The old 6BBR removes its Binding Table entry and notifies the
Registering Node with a status code of 3 (\"Moved\") if a new 6BBR
claims a fresher registration (same ROVR, fresher TID) for the same
address. The old 6BBR [MAY]{.bcp14} preserve a temporary state in order
to forward packets in flight. The state may be, for instance, an NCE
that was formed when an NA message was received. It may also be a
Binding Table entry in Stale state, pointing at the new 6BBR on the
backbone or any other abstract cache entry that can be used to resolve
the link-layer address of the new 6BBR. The old 6BBR [SHOULD]{.bcp14}

The procedures in this document modify the mechanisms used for IPv6 ND
and DAD and should not affect other aspects of IPv6 or
higher-level-protocol operation. As such, the main classes of attacks
that are in play are those that work to block Neighbor Discovery or to
forcibly claim an address that another node is attempting to use. In the
absence of cryptographic protection at higher layers, the latter class
of attacks can have significant consequences, with the attacker being
able to read all the \"stolen\" traffic that was directed to the target
of the attack.[¶](#section-11-1){.pilcrow}

This specification applies to LLNs and a backbone in which the
individual links are protected against rogue access on the LLN by
authenticating a node that attaches to the network and encrypting the
transmissions at the link layer and on the backbone side, using the
physical security and access control measures that are typically applied
there; thus, packets may neither be forged nor
overheard.[¶](#section-11-2){.pilcrow}

In particular, the LLN link layer is required to provide secure unicast
to/from the Backbone Router and secure broadcast from the routers in a
way that prevents tampering with or replaying the ND
messages.[¶](#section-11-3){.pilcrow}

For the IPv6 ND operation over the backbone, and unless the classical ND
is disabled (e.g., by configuration), the classical ND messages are
interpreted as emitted by the address owner and have precedence over the
6BBR that is only a proxy.[¶](#section-11-4){.pilcrow}

As a result, the security threats that are detailed in [Section
11.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4861#section-11.1){.relref} of
\[[RFC4861](#RFC4861){.xref}\] fully apply to this specification as
well. In short:[¶](#section-11-5){.pilcrow}

-   [Any node that can send a packet on the backbone can take over any
    address, including addresses of LLN nodes, by claiming it with an NA
    message and the Override bit set. This means that the real owner
    will stop receiving its
    packets.[¶](#section-11-6.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-11-6.1}
-   [Any node that can send a packet on the backbone can forge traffic
    and pretend it is issued from an address that it does not own, even
    if it did not claim the address using
    ND.[¶](#section-11-6.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-11-6.2}
-   [Any node that can send a packet on the backbone can present itself
    as a preferred router to intercept all traffic outgoing on the
    subnet. It may even expose a prefix on the subnet as \"not-on-link\"
    and intercept all the traffic within the
    subnet.[¶](#section-11-6.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-11-6.3}
-   [If the rogue can receive a packet from the backbone, it can also
    snoop all the intercepted traffic, by stealing an address or the
    role of a router.[¶](#section-11-6.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-11-6.4}

This means that any rogue access to the backbone must be prevented at
all times, and nodes that are attached to the backbone must be fully
trusted / never compromised.[¶](#section-11-7){.pilcrow}

Using address registration as the sole ND mechanism on a link and
coupling it with \[[RFC8928](#RFC8928){.xref}\] guarantees the ownership
of a Registered Address within that link.[¶](#section-11-8){.pilcrow}

-   [The protection is based on a proof of ownership encoded in the ROVR
    field, and it protects against address theft and impersonation by a
    6LN, because the 6LR can challenge the Registered Node for a proof
    of ownership.[¶](#section-11-9.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-11-9.1}
-   [The protection extends to the full LLN in the case of an LLN link,
    but it does not extend over the backbone since the 6BBR cannot
    provide the proof of ownership when it defends the
    address.[¶](#section-11-9.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-11-9.2}

A possible attack over the backbone can be done by sending an NS with an
EARO and expecting the NA(EARO) back to contain the TID and ROVR fields
of the existing state. With that information, the attacker can easily
increase the TID and take over the Binding.[¶](#section-11-10){.pilcrow}

If the classical ND is disabled on the backbone and the use of
\[[RFC8928](#RFC8928){.xref}\] and a 6LBR are mandated, the network will
benefit from the following new advantages:[¶](#section-11-11){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

Zero-trust security for ND flows within the whole subnet:
:   the increased security that \[[RFC8928](#RFC8928){.xref}\] provides
    on the LLN will also apply to the backbone; it becomes impossible
    for an attached node to claim an address that belongs to another
    node using ND, and the network can filter packets that are not
    originated by the owner of the source address (Source Address
    Validation Improvement (SAVI)), as long as the routers are known and
    trusted.[¶](#section-11-12.2){.pilcrow}
:   

Remote ND DoS attack avoidance:
:   the complete list of addresses in the network will be known to the
    6LBR and available to the default router; with that information, the
    router does not need to send a multicast NS(Lookup) in case of a
    Neighbor Cache miss for an incoming packet, which is a source of
    remote DoS attack against the
    network.[¶](#section-11-12.4){.pilcrow}
:   

Less IPv6 ND-related multicast on the backbone:
:   DAD and NS(Lookup) become unicast queries to the
    6LBR.[¶](#section-11-12.6){.pilcrow}
:   

Better DAD operation on wireless:
:   DAD has been found to fail to detect duplications on large Wi-Fi
    infrastructures due to the unreliable broadcast operation on
    wireless; using a 6LBR enables a unicast
    lookup.[¶](#section-11-12.8){.pilcrow}
:   

Less Layer 2 churn on the backbone:
:   Using the Routing Proxy approach, the link-layer address of the LLN
    devices and their mobility are not visible in the backbone; only the
    link-Layer addresses of the 6BBR and backbone nodes are visible at
    Layer 2 on the backbone. This is mandatory for LLNs that cannot be
    bridged on the backbone and useful in any case to scale down,
    stabilize the forwarding tables at Layer 2, and avoid the gratuitous
    frames that are typically broadcasted to fix the transparent
    bridging tables when a wireless node roams from an AP to the
    next.[¶](#section-11-12.10){.pilcrow}
:   

This specification introduces a 6BBR that is a router on the path of the
LLN traffic and a 6LBR that is used for the lookup. They could be
interesting targets for an attacker. A compromised 6BBR can accept a
registration but block the traffic or refrain from proxying. A
compromised 6LBR may unduly accept the transfer of ownership of an
address or block a newcomer by faking that its address is a duplicate.
But those attacks are possible in a classical network from a compromised
default router and a DHCP server, respectively, and can be prevented
using the same methods.[¶](#section-11-13){.pilcrow}

A possible attack over the LLN can still be done by compromising a 6LR.
A compromised 6LR may modify the ROVR of EDAR messages in flight and
transfer the ownership of the Registered Address to itself or a tier. It
may also claim that a ROVR was validated when it really wasn\'t and
reattribute an address to itself or to an attached 6LN. This means that
6LRs, as well as 6LBRs and 6BBRS, must still be fully trusted / never
compromised.[¶](#section-11-14){.pilcrow}

This specification mandates checking on the 6LBR on the backbone before
doing the classical DAD, in case the address already exists. This may
delay the DAD operation and should be protected by a short timer, in the
order of 100 ms or less, which will only represent a small extra delay
versus the 1 s wait of the DAD operation.[¶](#section-11-15){.pilcrow}

In LLNs with long-lived addresses such as Low-Power WAN (LPWANs),
STALE_DURATION [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be configured with a relatively long
value to cover an interval when the address may be reused and before it
is safe to expect that the address was definitively released. A good
default value is 24 hours. In LLNs where addresses are renewed rapidly,
e.g., for privacy reasons, STALE_DURATION [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be configured
with a relatively shorter value \-- 5 minutes by

## [Appendix A.](#section-appendix.a){.section-number .selfRef} [Possible Future Extensions](#name-possible-future-extensions){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-possible-future-extensions}

With the current specification, the 6LBR is not leveraged to avoid
multicast NS(Lookup) on the backbone. This could be done by adding a
lookup procedure in the EDAR/EDAC
exchange.[¶](#section-appendix.a-1){.pilcrow}

By default, the specification does not have a fine-grained trust model:
all nodes that can authenticate to the LLN link layer or attach to the
backbone are equally trusted. It would be desirable to provide a
stronger authorization model, e.g., whereby nodes that associate their
address with a proof of ownership \[[RFC8928](#RFC8928){.xref}\] should
be trusted more than nodes that do not. Such a trust model and related
signaling could be added in the future to override the default operation
and favor trusted nodes.[¶](#section-appendix.a-2){.pilcrow}

As an alternate to the ND Proxy operation, the registration may be
redistributed as a host route in a routing protocol that would operate
over the backbone; this is already happening in IoT networks
\[[RPL-LEAVES](#I-D.ietf-roll-unaware-leaves){.xref}\] and Data Center
Routing \[[RIFT](#I-D.ietf-rift-rift){.xref}\] and could be extended to
other protocols, e.g., BGP \[[RFC4271](#RFC4271){.xref}\] and OSPFv3
\[[RFC5340](#RFC5340){.xref}\]. The registration may also be advertised
in an overlay protocol such as Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6)
\[[RFC6275](#RFC6275){.xref}\], the Locator/ID Separation Protocol
(LISP) \[[RFC6830](#RFC6830){.xref}\], or Ethernet VPN (EVPN)
\[[RFC7432](#RFC7432){.xref}\].[¶](#section-appendix.a-3){.pilcrow}

## [Appendix B.](#section-appendix.b){.section-number .selfRef} [Applicability and Requirements Served](#name-applicability-and-requireme){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-applicability-and-requireme}

This document specifies ND proxy functions that can be used to federate
an IPv6 Backbone Link and multiple IPv6 LLNs into a single MLSN. The ND
proxy functions enable IPv6 ND services for DAD and address lookup that
do not require broadcasts over the
LLNs.[¶](#section-appendix.b-1){.pilcrow}

The term LLN is used to cover multiple types of WLANs and WPANs,
including (Low-Power) Wi-Fi, BLUETOOTH(R) Low Energy, IEEE Std 802.11ah
and IEEE Std 802.15.4 wireless meshes, and the types of networks listed
in \"Requirements Related to Various Low-Power Link Types\" (see
[Appendix
B.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8505#appendix-B.3){.relref} of
\[[RFC8505](#RFC8505){.xref}\]).[¶](#section-appendix.b-2){.pilcrow}

Each LLN in the subnet is attached to a 6BBR. The Backbone Routers
interconnect the LLNs and advertise the addresses of the 6LNs over the
Backbone Link using ND proxy
operations.[¶](#section-appendix.b-3){.pilcrow}

This specification updates IPv6 ND over the backbone to distinguish
address movement from duplication and eliminate Stale state in the
backbone routers and backbone nodes once a 6LN has roamed. This way,
mobile nodes may roam rapidly from one 6BBR to the next, and
requirements are met per \"Requirements Related to Mobility\" (see
[Appendix
B.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8505#appendix-B.1){.relref} of
\[[RFC8505](#RFC8505){.xref}\]).[¶](#section-appendix.b-4){.pilcrow}

A 6LN can register its IPv6 addresses and thereby obtain ND proxy
services over the backbone, meeting the requirements expressed in
\"Requirements Related to Proxy Operations\" (see [Appendix
B.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8505#appendix-B.4){.relref} of
\[[RFC8505](#RFC8505){.xref}\].[¶](#section-appendix.b-5){.pilcrow}

The negative impact of the IPv6 ND-related broadcasts can be limited to
one of the federated links, enabling the number of 6LNs to grow. The
Routing Proxy operation avoids the need to expose the link-layer
addresses of the 6LNs onto the backbone, keeping the Layer 2 topology
simple and stable. This meets the requirements in \"Requirements Related
to Scalability\" (see [Appendix
B.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8505#appendix-B.6){.relref} of
\[[RFC8505](#RFC8505){.xref}\]), as long as the 6BBRs are dimensioned
for the number of registrations that each needs to
support.[¶](#section-appendix.b-6){.pilcrow}

In the case of a Wi-Fi access link, a 6BBR may be collocated with the
AP, a Fabric Edge (FE), or a Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access
Points (CAPWAP) \[[RFC5415](#RFC5415){.xref}\] Wireless LAN Controller
(WLC). In those cases, the wireless client (STA) is the 6LN that makes
use of \[[RFC8505](#RFC8505){.xref}\] to register its IPv6 address(es)
to the 6BBR acting as the Routing Registrar. The 6LBR can be centralized
and either connected to the Backbone Link or reachable over IP. The 6BBR
ND proxy operations eliminate the need for wireless nodes to respond
synchronously when a lookup is performed for their IPv6 addresses. This
provides the function of a Sleep Proxy for ND
\[[DAD-APPROACHES](#I-D.nordmark-6man-dad-approaches){.xref}\].[¶](#section-appendix.b-7){.pilcrow}

For the Time-Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) mode of
\[[IEEEstd802154](#IEEEstd802154){.xref}\], the 6TiSCH architecture
\[[6TiSCH](#I-D.ietf-6tisch-architecture){.xref}\] describes how a
6LoWPAN ND host could connect to the Internet via a RPL mesh network,
but doing so requires extensions to the 6LOWPAN ND protocol to support
mobility and reachability in a secure and manageable environment. The
extensions detailed in this document also work for the 6TiSCH
architecture, serving the requirements listed in \"Requirements Related
to Routing Protocols\" (see [Appendix
B.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8505#appendix-B.2){.relref} of
\[[RFC8505](#RFC8505){.xref}\]).[¶](#section-appendix.b-8){.pilcrow}

The registration mechanism may be seen as a more reliable alternate to
snooping \[[SAVI-WLAN](#I-D.bi-savi-wlan){.xref}\]. Note that
registration and snooping are not mutually exclusive. Snooping may be
used in conjunction with the registration for nodes that do not register
their IPv6 addresses. The 6BBR assumes that if a node registers at least
one IPv6 address to it, then the node registers all of its addresses to
the 6BBR. With this assumption, the 6BBR can possibly cancel all
undesirable multicast NS messages that would otherwise have been
delivered to that node.[¶](#section-appendix.b-9){.pilcrow}

Scalability of the MLSN \[[RFC4903](#RFC4903){.xref}\] requires
avoidance of multicast/broadcast operations as much as possible even on
the backbone
\[[MCAST-PROBLEMS](#I-D.ietf-mboned-ieee802-mcast-problems){.xref}\].
Although hosts can connect to the backbone using IPv6 ND operations,
multicast RAs can be saved by using
\[[RS-REFRESH](#I-D.ietf-6man-rs-refresh){.xref}\], which also requires
the support of
\[[RFC7559](#RFC7559){.xref}\].[¶](#section-appendix.b-10){.pilcrow}
