# RFC 8930 {#rfcnum}

# On Forwarding 6LoWPAN Fragments over a Multi-Hop IPv6 Network {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

This document provides generic rules to enable the forwarding of an IPv6
over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Network (6LoWPAN) fragment over a
route-over network. Forwarding fragments can improve both end-to-end
latency and reliability as well as reduce the buffer requirements in
intermediate nodes; it may be implemented using RFC 4944 and Virtual
Reassembly Buffers (VRBs).[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

The original 6LoWPAN fragmentation is defined in
\[[RFC4944](#RFC4944){.xref}\] for use over a single Layer 3 hop, though
multiple Layer 2 hops in a mesh-under network is also possible, and was
not modified by the update in \[[RFC6282](#RFC6282){.xref}\]. 6LoWPAN
operations including fragmentation depend on a link-layer security that
prevents any rogue access to the network.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

In a route-over 6LoWPAN network, an IP packet is expected to be
reassembled at each intermediate hop, uncompressed, pushed to Layer 3 to
be routed, and then compressed and fragmented again. This document
introduces an alternate approach called 6LoWPAN Fragment Forwarding
(6LFF) whereby an intermediate node forwards a fragment (or the bulk
thereof, MTU permitting) without reassembling if the next hop is a
similar 6LoWPAN link. The routing decision is made on the first fragment
of the datagram, which has the IPv6 routing information. The first
fragment is forwarded immediately, and a state is stored to enable
forwarding the next fragments along the same
path.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

Done right, 6LoWPAN Fragment Forwarding techniques lead to more
streamlined operations, less buffer bloat, and lower latency. But it may
be wasteful when fragments are missing, leading to locked resources and
low throughput, and it may be misused to the point that the end-to-end
latency of one packet falls behind that of per-hop
reassembly.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

This specification provides a generic overview of 6LFF, discusses
advantages and caveats, and introduces a particular 6LFF technique
called \"Virtual Reassembly Buffer\" (VRB) that can be used while
retaining the message formats defined in \[[RFC4944](#RFC4944){.xref}\].
Basic recommendations such as the insertion of an inter-frame gap
between fragments are provided to avoid the most typical
caveats.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

Past experience with fragmentation, e.g., as described in [\"IPv4
Reassembly Errors at High Data Rates\"](#RFC4963){.xref}
\[[RFC4963](#RFC4963){.xref}\] and references therein, has shown that
misassociated or lost fragments can lead to poor network behavior and,
occasionally, trouble at the application layer. That experience led to
the definition of the [\"Path MTU Discovery for IP version
6\"](#RFC8201){.xref} \[[RFC8201](#RFC8201){.xref}\] protocol that
limits fragmentation over the Internet.[¶](#section-2.2-1){.pilcrow}

[\"IP Fragmentation Considered Fragile\"](#RFC8900){.xref}
\[[RFC8900](#RFC8900){.xref}\] discusses security threats that are
linked to using IP fragmentation. The 6LoWPAN fragmentation takes place
underneath the IP Layer, but some issues described there may still apply
to 6LoWPAN fragments (as discussed in further details in [Section
7](#security-considerations){.xref}).[¶](#section-2.2-2){.pilcrow}

Readers are expected to be familiar with all the terms and concepts that
are discussed in [\"IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks
(6LoWPANs): Overview, Assumptions, Problem Statement, and
Goals\"](#RFC4919){.xref} \[[RFC4919](#RFC4919){.xref}\] and
[\"Transmission of IPv6 Packets over IEEE 802.15.4
Networks\"](#RFC4944){.xref}
\[[RFC4944](#RFC4944){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2.2-3){.pilcrow}

[\"Multiprotocol Label Switching Architecture\"](#RFC3031){.xref}
\[[RFC3031](#RFC3031){.xref}\] states that with
MPLS,[¶](#section-2.2-4){.pilcrow}

> packets are \"labeled\" before they are forwarded. At subsequent hops,
> there is no further analysis of the packet\'s network layer header.
> Rather, the label is used as an index into a table which specifies the
> next hop, and a new label.[¶](#section-2.2-5){.pilcrow}

The MPLS technique is leveraged in the present specification to forward
fragments that actually do not have a network-layer header, since the
fragmentation occurs below IP.[¶](#section-2.2-6){.pilcrow}

[Figure 1](#figure-1){.selfRef}: [Fragmentation at Node A, and
Reassembly at Node B](#name-fragmentation-at-node-a-and){.selfRef}
:::

Typically, node A starts with an uncompressed packet and compacts the
IPv6 packet using the header compression mechanism defined in
\[[RFC6282](#RFC6282){.xref}\]. If the resulting 6LoWPAN packet does not
fit into a single link-layer frame, node A\'s 6LoWPAN sub-layer cuts it
into multiple 6LoWPAN fragments, which it transmits as separate
link-layer frames to node B. Node B\'s 6LoWPAN sub-layer reassembles
these fragments, inflates the compressed header fields back to the
original IPv6 header, and hands over the full IPv6 packet to its IPv6
layer.[¶](#section-3-3){.pilcrow}

In [Figure 1](#FIGperhop){.xref}, a packet forwarded by node A to node B
is cut into nine fragments, numbered 1 to 9 as
follows:[¶](#section-3-4){.pilcrow}

-   [Each fragment is represented by the \'#\'
    symbol.[¶](#section-3-5.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-5.1}
-   [Node A has sent fragments 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 to node
    B.[¶](#section-3-5.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-5.2}
-   [Node B has received fragments 1, 2, 3, and 6 from node
    A.[¶](#section-3-5.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-5.3}
-   [Fragment 5 is still being transmitted at the link layer from node A
    to node B.[¶](#section-3-5.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-5.4}

The reassembly buffer for 6LoWPAN is indexed in node B
by:[¶](#section-3-6){.pilcrow}

-   [a unique identifier of node A (e.g., node A\'s link-layer
    address).[¶](#section-3-7.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-7.1}
-   [the Datagram_Tag chosen by node A for this fragmented
    datagram.[¶](#section-3-7.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-7.2}

Because it may be hard for node B to correlate all possible link-layer
addresses that node A may use (e.g., short versus long addresses), node
A must use the same link-layer address to send all the fragments of the
same datagram to node B.[¶](#section-3-8){.pilcrow}

Conceptually, the reassembly buffer in node B
contains:[¶](#section-3-9){.pilcrow}

-   [a Datagram_Tag as received in the incoming fragments, associated
    with the interface and the link-layer address of node A for which
    the received Datagram_Tag is
    unique,[¶](#section-3-10.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-10.1}
-   [the actual packet data from the fragments received so far, in a
    form that makes it possible to detect when the whole packet has been
    received and can be processed or
    forwarded,[¶](#section-3-10.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-10.2}
-   [a state indicating the fragments already
    received,[¶](#section-3-10.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-10.3}
-   [a Datagram_Size,
    and[¶](#section-3-10.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-10.4}
-   [a timer that allows discarding a partially reassembled packet after
    some timeout.[¶](#section-3-10.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-10.5}

A fragmentation header is added to each fragment; it indicates what
portion of the packet that fragment corresponds to. [Section
5.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4944#section-5.3){.relref} of
\[[RFC4944](#RFC4944){.xref}\] defines the format of the header for the
first and subsequent fragments. All fragments are tagged with a 16-bit
\"Datagram_Tag\", used to identify which packet each fragment belongs
to. Each datagram can be uniquely identified by the sender link-layer
addresses of the frame that carries it and the Datagram_Tag that the
sender allocated for this datagram. \[[RFC4944](#RFC4944){.xref}\] also
mandates that the first fragment is sent first and with a particular
format that is different than that of the next fragments. Each fragment
except for the first one can be identified within its datagram by the
datagram-offset.[¶](#section-3-11){.pilcrow}

Node B\'s typical behavior, per \[[RFC4944](#RFC4944){.xref}\], is as
follows. Upon receiving a fragment from node A with a Datagram_Tag
previously unseen from node A, node B allocates a buffer large enough to
hold the entire packet. The length of the packet is indicated in each
fragment (the Datagram_Size field), so node B can allocate the buffer
even if the fragment it receives first is not the first fragment. As
fragments come in, node B fills the buffer. When all fragments have been
received, node B inflates the compressed header fields into an IPv6
header and hands the resulting IPv6 packet to the IPv6 layer, which
performs the route lookup. This behavior typically results in per-hop
fragmentation and reassembly. That is, the packet is fully reassembled,
then (re-)fragmented, at every hop.[¶](#section-3-12){.pilcrow}

When reassembling, a node needs to wait for all the fragments to be
received before being able to re-form the IPv6 packet and possibly
forwarding it to the next hop. This repeats at every
hop.[¶](#section-4.1-1){.pilcrow}

This may result in increased end-to-end latency compared to a case where
each fragment is forwarded without per-hop
reassembly.[¶](#section-4.1-2){.pilcrow}

Constrained nodes have limited memory. Assuming a reassembly buffer for
a 6LoWPAN MTU of 1280 bytes as defined in [Section
4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4944#section-4){.relref} of
\[[RFC4944](#RFC4944){.xref}\], typical nodes only have enough memory
for 1-3 reassembly buffers.[¶](#section-4.2-1){.pilcrow}

To illustrate this, we use the topology from [Figure
2](#FIGtopology){.xref}, where nodes A, B, C, and D all send packets
through node E. We further assume that node E\'s memory can only hold 3
reassembly buffers.[¶](#section-4.2-2){.pilcrow}

## [5.](#section-5){.section-number .selfRef} [Forwarding Fragments](#name-forwarding-fragments){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-forwarding-fragments}

A 6LoWPAN Fragment Forwarding technique makes the routing decision on
the first fragment, which is always the one with the IPv6 address of the
destination. Upon receiving a first fragment, a forwarding node (e.g.,
node B in an A-\>B-\>C sequence) that does fragment forwarding
[MUST]{.bcp14} attempt to create a state and forward the fragment. This
is an atomic operation, and if the first fragment cannot be forwarded,
then the state [MUST]{.bcp14} be removed.[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

Since the Datagram_Tag is uniquely associated with the source link-layer
address of the fragment, the forwarding node [MUST]{.bcp14} assign a new
Datagram_Tag from its own namespace for the next hop and rewrite the
fragment header of each fragment with that
Datagram_Tag.[¶](#section-5-2){.pilcrow}

When a forwarding node receives a fragment other than a first fragment,
it [MUST]{.bcp14} look up state based on the source link-layer address
and the Datagram_Tag in the received fragment. If no such state is
found, the fragment [MUST]{.bcp14} be dropped; otherwise, the fragment
[MUST]{.bcp14} be forwarded using the information in the state
found.[¶](#section-5-3){.pilcrow}

Compared to [Section 3](#overview-of-6lowpan-fragmentation){.xref}, the
conceptual reassembly buffer in node B now contains the following,
assuming that node B is neither the source nor the final
destination:[¶](#section-5-4){.pilcrow}

-   [a Datagram_Tag as received in the incoming fragments, associated
    with the interface and the link-layer address of node A for which
    the received Datagram_Tag is
    unique.[¶](#section-5-5.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-5-5.1}
-   [the link-layer address that node B uses as the source to forward
    the fragments.[¶](#section-5-5.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-5-5.2}
-   [the interface and the link-layer address of the next-hop C that is
    resolved on the first
    fragment.[¶](#section-5-5.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-5-5.3}
-   [a Datagram_Tag that node B uniquely allocated for this datagram and
    that is used when forwarding the fragments of the
    datagram.[¶](#section-5-5.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-5-5.4}
-   [a buffer for the remainder of a previous fragment left to be
    sent.[¶](#section-5-5.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-5-5.5}
-   [a timer that allows discarding the stale 6LFF state after some
    timeout. The duration of the timer should be longer than that which
    covers the reassembly at the receiving
    endpoint.[¶](#section-5-5.6){.pilcrow}]{#section-5-5.6}

A node that has not received the first fragment cannot forward the next
fragments. This means that if node B receives a fragment, node A was in
possession of the first fragment at some point. To keep the operation
simple and consistent with \[[RFC4944](#RFC4944){.xref}\], the first
fragment [MUST]{.bcp14} always be sent first. When that is done, if node
B receives a fragment that is not the first and for which it has no
state, then node B treats it as an error and refrains from creating a
state or attempting to forward. This also means that node A should
perform all its possible retries on the first fragment before it
attempts to send the next fragments, and that it should abort the
datagram and release its state if it fails to send the first
fragment.[¶](#section-5-6){.pilcrow}

Fragment forwarding obviates some of the benefits of the 6LoWPAN header
compression \[[RFC6282](#RFC6282){.xref}\] in intermediate hops. In
return, the memory used to store the packet is distributed along the
path, which limits the buffer-bloat effect. Multiple fragments may
progress simultaneously along the network as long as they do not
interfere. An associated caveat is that on a half-duplex radio, if node
A sends the next fragment at the same time as node B forwards the
previous fragment to node C down the path, then node B will miss it. If
node C forwards the previous fragment to node D at the same time and on
the same frequency as node A sends the next fragment to node B, this may
result in a hidden terminal problem. In that case, the transmission from
node C interferes at node B with that from node A, unbeknownst to node
A. Consecutive fragments of a same datagram [MUST]{.bcp14} be separated
with an inter-frame gap that allows one fragment to progress beyond the
next hop and beyond the interference domain before the next shows up.
This can be achieved by interleaving packets or fragments sent via
different next-hop routers.[¶](#section-5-7){.pilcrow}

## [6.](#section-6){.section-number .selfRef} [Virtual Reassembly Buffer (VRB) Implementation](#name-virtual-reassembly-buffer-v){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-virtual-reassembly-buffer-v}

The VRB \[[LWIG-VRB](#I-D.ietf-lwig-6lowpan-virtual-reassembly){.xref}\]
is a particular incarnation of a 6LFF that can be implemented without a
change to \[[RFC4944](#RFC4944){.xref}\].[¶](#section-6-1){.pilcrow}

VRB overcomes the limitations listed in [Section 4](#SEClimits){.xref}.
Nodes do not wait for the last fragment before forwarding, reducing
end-to-end latency. Similarly, the memory footprint of VRB is just the
VRB table, reducing the packet drop probability
significantly.[¶](#section-6-2){.pilcrow}

However, there are other caveats:[¶](#section-6-3){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

Non-zero Packet Drop Probability:
:   The abstract data in a VRB table entry contains at a minimum the
    link-layer address of the predecessor and the successor, the
    Datagram_Tag used by the predecessor, and the local Datagram_Tag
    that this node will swap with it. The VRB may need to store a few
    octets from the last fragment that may not have fit within MTU and
    that will be prepended to the next fragment. This yields a small
    footprint that is 2 orders of magnitude smaller, compared to needing
    a 1280-byte reassembly buffer for each packet. Yet, the size of the
    VRB table necessarily remains finite. In the extreme case where a
    node is required to concurrently forward more packets than it has
    entries in its VRB table, packets are
    dropped.[¶](#section-6-4.2){.pilcrow}
:   

No Fragment Recovery:
:   There is no mechanism in VRB for the node that reassembles a packet
    to request a single missing fragment. Dropping a fragment requires
    the whole packet to be resent. This causes unnecessary traffic, as
    fragments are forwarded even when the destination node can never
    construct the original IPv6 packet.[¶](#section-6-4.4){.pilcrow}
:   

No Per-Fragment Routing:
:   All subsequent fragments follow the same sequence of hops from the
    source to the destination node as the first fragment, because the IP
    header is required in order to route the fragment and is only
    present in the first fragment. A side effect is that the first
    fragment must always be forwarded
    first.[¶](#section-6-4.6){.pilcrow}
:   

The severity and occurrence of these caveats depend on the link layer
used. Whether they are acceptable depends entirely on the requirements
the application places on the network.[¶](#section-6-5){.pilcrow}

If the caveats are present and not acceptable for the application,
alternative specifications may define new protocols to overcome them.
One example is \[[RFC8931](#RFC8931){.xref}\], which specifies a 6LFF
technique that allows the end-to-end fragment recovery between the 6LFF
endpoints.[¶](#section-6-6){.pilcrow}

::: {#security-considerations}

## [7.](#section-7){.section-number .selfRef} [Security Considerations](#name-security-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-security-considerations}

An attacker can perform a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack on a node
implementing VRB by generating a large number of bogus \"fragment 1\"
fragments without sending subsequent fragments. This causes the VRB
table to fill up. Note that the VRB does not need to remember the full
datagram as received so far but only possibly a few octets from the last
fragment that could not fit in it. It is expected that an implementation
protects itself to keep the number of VRBs within capacity, and that old
VRBs are protected by a timer of a reasonable duration for the
technology and destroyed upon timeout.[¶](#section-7-1){.pilcrow}

Secure joining and the link-layer security that it sets up protects
against those attacks from network outsiders.[¶](#section-7-2){.pilcrow}

[\"IP Fragmentation Considered Fragile\"](#RFC8900){.xref}
\[[RFC8900](#RFC8900){.xref}\] discusses security threats and other
caveats that are linked to using IP fragmentation. The 6LoWPAN
fragmentation takes place underneath the IP Layer, but some issues
described there may still apply to 6LoWPAN
fragments.[¶](#section-7-3){.pilcrow}

-   [Overlapping fragment attacks are possible with 6LoWPAN fragments,
    but there is no known firewall operation that would work on 6LoWPAN
    fragments at the time of this writing, so the exposure is limited.
    An implementation of a firewall [SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} forward
    fragments but instead should recompose the IP packet, check it in
    the uncompressed form, and then forward it again as fragments if
    necessary. Overlapping fragments are acceptable as long as they
    contain the same payload. The firewall [MUST]{.bcp14} drop the whole
    packet if overlapping fragments are encountered that result in
    different data at the same
    offset.[¶](#section-7-4.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-7-4.1}
-   [Resource-exhaustion attacks are certainly possible and a sensitive
    issue in a constrained network. An attacker can perform a DoS attack
    on a node implementing VRB by generating a large number of bogus
    first fragments without sending subsequent fragments. This causes
    the VRB table to fill up. When hop-by-hop reassembly is used, the
    same attack can be more damaging if the node allocates a full
    Datagram_Size for each bogus first fragment. With the VRB, the
    attack can be performed remotely on all nodes along a path, but each
    node suffers a lesser hit. This is because the VRB does not need to
    remember the full datagram as received so far but only possibly a
    few octets from the last fragment that could not fit in it. An
    implementation [MUST]{.bcp14} protect itself to keep the number of
    VRBs within capacity and to ensure that old VRBs are protected by a
    timer of a reasonable duration for the technology and destroyed upon
    timeout.[¶](#section-7-4.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-7-4.2}
-   [Attacks based on predictable fragment identification values are
    also possible but can be avoided. The Datagram_Tag [SHOULD]{.bcp14}
    be assigned pseudorandomly in order to reduce the risk of such
    attacks. A larger size of the Datagram_Tag makes the guessing more
    difficult and reduces the chances of an accidental reuse while the
    original packet is still in flight, at the expense of more space in
    each frame. Nonetheless, some level of risk remains because an
    attacker that is able to authenticate to and send traffic on the
    network can guess a valid Datagram_Tag value, since there are only a
    limited number of possible
    values.[¶](#section-7-4.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-7-4.3}
-   [Evasion of Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDSs) leverages
    ambiguity in the reassembly of the fragment. This attack makes
    little sense in the context of this specification since the
    fragmentation happens within the Low-Power and Lossy Network (LLN),
    meaning that the intruder should already be inside to perform the
    attack. NIDS systems would probably not be installed within the LLN
    either but rather at a bottleneck at the exterior edge of the
    network.[¶](#section-7-4.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-7-4.4}
