# Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key Infrastructure (BRSKI) {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

This document specifies automated bootstrapping of an Autonomic Control
Plane. To do this, a Secure Key Infrastructure is bootstrapped. This is
done using manufacturer-installed X.509 certificates, in combination
with a manufacturer\'s authorizing service, both online and offline. We
call this process the Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key Infrastructure
(BRSKI) protocol. Bootstrapping a new device can occur when using a
routable address and a cloud service, only link-local connectivity, or
limited/disconnected networks. Support for deployment models with less
stringent security requirements is included. Bootstrapping is complete
when the cryptographic identity of the new key infrastructure is
successfully deployed to the device. The established secure connection
can be used to deploy a locally issued certificate to the device as
well.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

The Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key Infrastructure (BRSKI) protocol
provides a solution for secure zero-touch (automated) bootstrap of new
(unconfigured) devices that are called \"pledges\" in this document.
Pledges have an Initial Device Identifier (IDevID) installed in them at
the factory.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

\"BRSKI\", pronounced like \"brewski\", is a colloquial term for beer in
Canada and parts of the Midwestern United States
\[[brewski](#brewski){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

This document primarily provides for the needs of the ISP and
enterprise-focused Autonomic Networking Integrated Model and Approach
(ANIMA) Autonomic Control Plane (ACP) \[[RFC8994](#RFC8994){.xref}\].
This bootstrap process satisfies the requirement of making all
operations secure by default per [Section
3.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7575#section-3.3){.relref} of
\[[RFC7575](#RFC7575){.xref}\]. Other users of the BRSKI protocol will
need to provide separate applicability statements that include privacy
and security considerations appropriate to that deployment. [Section
9](#acpapplicability){.xref} explains the detailed applicability for
this ACP usage.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

The BRSKI protocol requires a significant amount of communication
between manufacturer and owner: in its default modes, it provides a
cryptographic transfer of control to the initial owner. In its strongest
modes, it leverages sales channel information to identify the owner in
advance. Resale of devices is possible, provided that the manufacturer
is willing to authorize the transfer. Mechanisms to enable transfers of
ownership without manufacturer authorization are not included in this
version of the protocol, but it could be designed into future
versions.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

This document describes how a pledge discovers (or are discovered by) an
element of the network domain that it will belong to and that will
perform its bootstrap. This element (device) is called the
\"registrar\". Before any other operation, the pledge and registrar need
to establish mutual trust:[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}

1.  [Registrar authenticating the pledge: \"Who is this device? What is
    its identity?\"[¶](#section-1-6.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-6.1}
2.  [Registrar authorizing the pledge: \"Is it mine? Do I want it? What
    are the chances it has been
    compromised?\"[¶](#section-1-6.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-6.2}
3.  [Pledge authenticating the registrar: \"What is this registrar\'s
    identity?\"[¶](#section-1-6.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-6.3}
4.  [Pledge authorizing the registrar: \"Should I join this
    network?\"[¶](#section-1-6.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-6.4}

This document details protocols and messages to answer the above
questions. It uses a TLS connection and a PKIX-shaped (X.509v3)
certificate (an IEEE 802.1AR IDevID \[[IDevID](#IDevID){.xref}\]) of the
pledge to answer points 1 and 2. It uses a new artifact called a
\"voucher\" that the registrar receives from a Manufacturer Authorized
Signing Authority (MASA) and passes it to the pledge to answer points 3
and 4.[¶](#section-1-7){.pilcrow}

A proxy provides very limited connectivity between the pledge and the
registrar.[¶](#section-1-8){.pilcrow}

The syntactic details of vouchers are described in detail in
\[[RFC8366](#RFC8366){.xref}\]. This document details automated protocol
mechanisms to obtain vouchers, including the definition of a
\"voucher-request\" message that is a minor extension to the voucher
format (see [Section 3](#voucher-request){.xref}) as defined by
\[[RFC8366](#RFC8366){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-9){.pilcrow}

BRSKI results in the pledge storing an X.509 root certificate sufficient
for verifying the registrar identity. In the process, a TLS connection
is established that can be directly used for Enrollment over Secure
Transport (EST). In effect, BRSKI provides an automated mechanism for
\"Bootstrap Distribution of CA Certificates\" described in
\[[RFC7030](#RFC7030){.xref}\], [Section
4.1.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7030#section-4.1.1){.relref},
wherein the pledge \"[MUST]{.bcp14} \[\...\] engage a human user to
authorize the CA certificate using out-of-band data\". With BRSKI, the
pledge now can automate this process using the voucher. Integration with
a complete EST enrollment is optional but
trivial.[¶](#section-1-10){.pilcrow}

BRSKI is agile enough to support bootstrapping alternative key
infrastructures, such as a symmetric key solution, but no such system is
described in this document.[¶](#section-1-11){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-1.1 .section}
### [1.1.](#section-1.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Prior Bootstrapping Approaches](#name-prior-bootstrapping-approac){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-prior-bootstrapping-approac}

To literally \"pull yourself up by the bootstraps\" is an impossible
action. Similarly, the secure establishment of a key infrastructure
without external help is also an impossibility. Today, it is commonly
accepted that the initial connections between nodes are insecure, until
key distribution is complete, or that domain-specific keying material
(often pre-shared keys, including mechanisms like Subscriber
Identification Module (SIM) cards) is pre-provisioned on each new device
in a costly and non-scalable manner. Existing automated mechanisms are
known as non-secured \"Trust on First Use (TOFU)\"
\[[RFC7435](#RFC7435){.xref}\], \"resurrecting duckling\"
\[[Stajano99theresurrecting](#Stajano99theresurrecting){.xref}\], or
\"pre-staging\".[¶](#section-1.1-1){.pilcrow}

Another prior approach has been to try and minimize user actions during
bootstrapping, but not eliminate all user actions. The original EST
protocol \[[RFC7030](#RFC7030){.xref}\] does reduce user actions during
bootstrapping but does not provide solutions for how the following
protocol steps can be made autonomic (not involving user
actions):[¶](#section-1.1-2){.pilcrow}

-   [using the Implicit Trust Anchor (TA) \[[RFC7030](#RFC7030){.xref}\]
    database to authenticate an owner-specific service (not an autonomic
    solution because the URL must be securely
    distributed),[¶](#section-1.1-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-1.1-3.1}
-   [engaging a human user to authorize the CA certificate using
    out-of-band data (not an autonomic solution because the human user
    is involved),[¶](#section-1.1-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-1.1-3.2}
-   [using a configured Explicit TA database (not an autonomic solution
    because the distribution of an explicit TA database is not
    autonomic), and[¶](#section-1.1-3.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-1.1-3.3}
-   [using a certificate-less TLS mutual authentication method (not an
    autonomic solution because the distribution of symmetric key
    material is not
    autonomic).[¶](#section-1.1-3.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-1.1-3.4}

These \"touch\" methods do not meet the requirements for
zero-touch.[¶](#section-1.1-4){.pilcrow}

There are \"call home\" technologies where the pledge first establishes
a connection to a well-known manufacturer service using a common
client-server authentication model. After mutual authentication,
appropriate credentials to authenticate the target domain are
transferred to the pledge. This creates several problems and
limitations:[¶](#section-1.1-5){.pilcrow}

-   [the pledge requires real-time connectivity to the manufacturer
    service,[¶](#section-1.1-6.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-1.1-6.1}
-   [the domain identity is exposed to the manufacturer service (this is
    a privacy concern),
    and[¶](#section-1.1-6.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-1.1-6.2}
-   [the manufacturer is responsible for making the authorization
    decisions (this is a liability
    concern).[¶](#section-1.1-6.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-1.1-6.3}

BRSKI addresses these issues by defining extensions to the EST protocol
for the automated distribution of vouchers.[¶](#section-1.1-7){.pilcrow}

Domain CA:
:   The domain Certification Authority (CA) provides certification
    functionalities to the domain. At a minimum, it provides

    key that defines the domain. Optionally, it certifies all
    elements.[¶](#section-1.2-3.10){.pilcrow}

enrollment:
:   The process where a device presents key material to a network and
    acquires a network-specific identity. For example, when a

    is obtained in response.[¶](#section-1.2-3.14){.pilcrow}

IDevID:
:   An Initial Device Identifier X.509 certificate installed by the
    vendor on new equipment. This is a term from 802.1AR
    \[[IDevID](#IDevID){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1.2-3.16){.pilcrow}
:   

imprint:
:   The process where a device obtains the cryptographic key material to
    identify and trust future interactions with a network. This term is
    taken from Konrad Lorenz\'s work in biology with new ducklings:
    during a critical period, the duckling would assume that anything
    that looks like a mother duck is in fact their mother. An equivalent
    for a device is to obtain the fingerprint of the network\'s root CA
    certificate. A device that imprints on an attacker suffers a similar
    fate to a duckling that imprints on a hungry wolf. Securely
    imprinting is a primary focus of this document
    \[[imprinting](#imprinting){.xref}\]. The analogy to Lorenz\'s work
    was first noted in
    \[[Stajano99theresurrecting](#Stajano99theresurrecting){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1.2-3.18){.pilcrow}
:   

IPIP Proxy:
:   A stateless proxy alternative.[¶](#section-1.2-3.20){.pilcrow}
:   

Join Proxy:
:   A domain entity that helps the pledge join the domain. A Join Proxy
    facilitates communication for devices that find themselves in an
    environment where they are not provided connectivity until after
    they are validated as members of the domain. For simplicity, this
    document sometimes uses the term of \"proxy\" to indicate the Join
    Proxy. The pledge is unaware that they are communicating with a
    proxy rather than directly with a
    registrar.[¶](#section-1.2-3.22){.pilcrow}
:   

Join Registrar (and Coordinator):
:   A representative of the domain that is configured, perhaps
    autonomically, to decide whether a new device is allowed to join the
    domain. The administrator of the domain interfaces with a \"Join
    Registrar (and Coordinator)\" to control this process. Typically, a
    Join Registrar is \"inside\" its domain. For simplicity, this
    document often refers to this as just \"registrar\". Within
    \[[RFC8993](#RFC8993){.xref}\], it is referred to as the \"Join
    Registrar Autonomic Service Agent (ASA)\". Other communities use the
    abbreviation \"JRC\".[¶](#section-1.2-3.24){.pilcrow}
:   

LDevID:
:   A Local Device Identifier X.509 certificate installed by the owner
    of the equipment. This is a term from 802.1AR
    \[[IDevID](#IDevID){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1.2-3.26){.pilcrow}
:   

manufacturer:
:   The term manufacturer is used throughout this document as the entity
    that created the device. This is typically the original equipment
    manufacturer (OEM), but in more complex situations, it could be a
    value added retailer (VAR), or possibly even a systems integrator.
    In general, a goal of BRSKI is to eliminate small distinctions
    between different sales channels. The reason for this is that it
    permits a single device, with a uniform firmware load, to be shipped
    directly to all customers. This eliminates costs for the
    manufacturer. This also reduces the number of products supported in
    the field, increasing the chance that firmware will be more up to
    date.[¶](#section-1.2-3.28){.pilcrow}
:   

MASA Audit-Log:
:   An anonymized list of previous owners maintained by the MASA on a
    per-device (per-pledge) basis, as described in [Section
    5.8.1](#MASAauditlog){.xref}.[¶](#section-1.2-3.30){.pilcrow}
:   

MASA Service:
:   A third-party MASA service on the global Internet. The MASA signs
    vouchers. It also provides a repository for audit-log information of
    privacy-protected bootstrapping events. It does not track
    ownership.[¶](#section-1.2-3.32){.pilcrow}
:   

nonced:
:   A voucher (or request) that contains a nonce (the normal
    case).[¶](#section-1.2-3.34){.pilcrow}
:   

nonceless:
:   A voucher (or request) that does not contain a nonce and either
    relies upon accurate clocks for expiration or does not
    expire.[¶](#section-1.2-3.36){.pilcrow}
:   

offline:
:   When an architectural component cannot perform real-time
    communications with a peer, due to either network connectivity or
    the peer being turned off, the operation is said to be occurring
    offline.[¶](#section-1.2-3.38){.pilcrow}
:   

Ownership Tracker:
:   An Ownership Tracker service on the global Internet. The Ownership
    Tracker uses business processes to accurately track ownership of all
    devices shipped against domains that have purchased them. Although
    optional, this component allows vendors to provide additional value
    in cases where their sales and distribution channels allow for
    accurate tracking of such ownership. Tracking information about
    ownership is indicated in vouchers, as described in
    \[[RFC8366](#RFC8366){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1.2-3.40){.pilcrow}

Pledge:
:   The prospective (unconfigured) device, which has an identity
    installed at the factory.[¶](#section-1.2-3.42){.pilcrow}
:   

(Public) Key Infrastructure:
:   The collection of systems and processes that sustains the activities
    of a public key system. The registrar acts as a \"Registration
    Authority\"; see \[[RFC5280](#RFC5280){.xref}\] and [Section
    7](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5272#section-7){.relref} of
    \[[RFC5272](#RFC5272){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1.2-3.44){.pilcrow}
:   

TOFU:
:   Trust on First Use. Used similarly to how it is described in
    \[[RFC7435](#RFC7435){.xref}\]. This is where a pledge device makes
    no security decisions but rather simply trusts the first registrar
    it is contacted by. This is also known as the \"resurrecting
    duckling\" model.[¶](#section-1.2-3.46){.pilcrow}
:   

Voucher:
:   A signed artifact from the MASA that indicates the cryptographic
    identity of the registrar it should trust to a pledge. There are
    different types of vouchers depending on how that trust is asserted.
    Multiple voucher types are defined in
    \[[RFC8366](#RFC8366){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1.2-3.48){.pilcrow}

This solution (BRSKI) can support large router platforms with
multi-gigabit inter-connections, mounted in controlled access data
centers. But this solution is not exclusive to large equipment: it is
intended to scale to thousands of devices located in hostile
environments, such as ISP-provided Customer Premises Equipment (CPE)
devices that are drop-shipped to the end user. The situation where an
order is fulfilled from a distributed warehouse from a common stock and
shipped directly to the target location at the request of a domain owner
is explicitly supported. That stock (\"SKU\") could be provided to a
number of potential domain owners, and the eventual domain owner will
not know a priori which device will go to which
location.[¶](#section-1.3.1-1){.pilcrow}

The bootstrapping process can take minutes to complete depending on the
network infrastructure and device processing speed. The network
communication itself is not optimized for speed; for privacy reasons,
the discovery process allows for the pledge to avoid announcing its
presence through broadcasting.[¶](#section-1.3.1-2){.pilcrow}

Nomadic or mobile devices often need to acquire credentials to access
the network at the new location. An example of this is mobile phone
roaming among network operators, or even between cell towers. This is
usually called \"handoff\". BRSKI does not provide a low-latency
handoff, which is usually a requirement in such situations. For these
solutions, BRSKI can be used to create a relationship (an LDevID) with
the \"home\" domain owner. The resulting credentials are then used to
provide credentials more appropriate for a low-latency
handoff.[¶](#section-1.3.1-3){.pilcrow}

#### [1.3.2.](#section-1.3.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Constrained Environments](#name-constrained-environments){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-constrained-environments}

Questions have been posed as to whether this solution is suitable in
general for Internet of Things (IoT) networks. This depends on the
capabilities of the devices in question. The terminology of
\[[RFC7228](#RFC7228){.xref}\] is best used to describe the
boundaries.[¶](#section-1.3.2-1){.pilcrow}

The solution described in this document is aimed in general at
non-constrained (i.e., Class 2+ \[[RFC7228](#RFC7228){.xref}\]) devices
operating on a non-challenged network. The entire solution as described
here is not intended to be usable as is by constrained devices operating
on challenged networks (such as 802.15.4 Low-Power and Lossy Networks
(LLNs)).[¶](#section-1.3.2-2){.pilcrow}

Specifically, there are protocol aspects described here that might
result in congestion collapse or energy exhaustion of intermediate
battery-powered routers in an LLN. Those types of networks should not
use this solution. These limitations are predominately related to the
large credential and key sizes required for device authentication.
Defining symmetric key techniques that meet the operational requirements
is out of scope, but the underlying protocol operations (TLS handshake
and signing structures) have sufficient algorithm agility to support
such techniques when defined.[¶](#section-1.3.2-3){.pilcrow}

The imprint protocol described here could, however, be used by
non-energy constrained devices joining a non-constrained network (for
instance, smart light bulbs are usually mains powered and use 802.11
wireless technology). It could also be used by non-constrained devices
across a non-energy constrained, but challenged, network (such as
802.15.4). The certificate contents, and the process by which the four
questions above are resolved, do apply to constrained devices. It is
simply the actual on-the-wire imprint protocol that could be
inappropriate.[¶](#section-1.3.2-4){.pilcrow}

This document presumes that network access control has already occurred,

Although the use of an X.509 IDevID is consistent with IEEE 802.1AR
\[[IDevID](#IDevID){.xref}\], and allows for alignment with 802.1X

### [2.2.](#section-2.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Secure Imprinting Using Vouchers](#name-secure-imprinting-using-vou){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-secure-imprinting-using-vou}

A voucher is a cryptographically protected artifact (using a digital
signature) to the pledge device authorizing a zero-touch imprint on the
registrar domain.[¶](#section-2.2-1){.pilcrow}

The format and cryptographic mechanism of vouchers is described in
detail in \[[RFC8366](#RFC8366){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2.2-2){.pilcrow}

Vouchers provide a flexible mechanism to secure imprinting: the pledge
device only imprints when a voucher can be validated. At the lowest
security levels, the MASA can indiscriminately issue vouchers and log
claims of ownership by domains. At the highest security levels, issuance
of vouchers can be integrated with complex sales channel integrations
that are beyond the scope of this document. The sales channel
integration would verify actual (legal) ownership of the pledge by the
domain. This provides the flexibility for a number of use cases via a
single common protocol mechanism on the pledge and registrar devices
that are to be widely deployed in the field. The MASA services have the
flexibility to either leverage the currently defined claim mechanisms or
experiment with higher or lower security
levels.[¶](#section-2.2-3){.pilcrow}

Vouchers provide a signed but non-encrypted communication channel among
the pledge, the MASA, and the registrar. The registrar maintains control
over the transport and policy decisions, allowing the local security
policy of the domain network to be
enforced.[¶](#section-2.2-4){.pilcrow}

Pledge authentication and pledge voucher-request signing is via a
PKIX-shaped certificate installed during the manufacturing process. This
is the 802.1AR IDevID, and it provides a basis for authenticating the
pledge during the protocol exchanges described here. There is no
requirement for a common root PKI hierarchy. Each device manufacturer
can generate its own root certificate. Specifically, the IDevID

In the context of BRSKI, pledges have a 1:1 relationship with a
\"serial-number\". This serial-number is used both in the serial-number
field of a voucher or voucher-requests (see [Section
3](#voucher-request){.xref}) and in local policies on the registrar or
MASA (see [Section
5](#ProtocolDetails){.xref}).[¶](#section-2.3.1-1){.pilcrow}

There is a (certificate) serialNumber field defined in
\[[RFC5280](#RFC5280){.xref}\], [Section
4.1.2.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5280#section-4.1.2.2){.relref}.
In ASN.1, this is referred to as the CertificateSerialNumber. This field
is NOT relevant to this specification. Do not confuse this field with
the serial-number defined by this document, or by
\[[IDevID](#IDevID){.xref}\] and \[[RFC4519](#RFC4519){.xref}\],
[Section
2.31](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4519#section-2.31){.relref}.[¶](#section-2.3.1-2){.pilcrow}

The device serial number is defined in [Appendix
A.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5280#appendix-A.1){.relref} of
\[[RFC5280](#RFC5280){.xref}\] as the X520SerialNumber, with the OID tag
id-at-serialNumber.[¶](#section-2.3.1-3){.pilcrow}

The device *serialNumber* field (X520SerialNumber) is used as follows by
the pledge to build the **serial-number** that is placed in the
voucher-request. In order to build it, the fields need to be converted
into a serial-number of \"type string\".[¶](#section-2.3.1-4){.pilcrow}

An example of a printable form of the serialNumber field is provided in
\[[RFC4519](#RFC4519){.xref}\], [Section
2.31](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4519#section-2.31){.relref}
(\"WI-3005\"). That section further provides equality and syntax
attributes.[¶](#section-2.3.1-5){.pilcrow}

Due to the reality of existing device identity provisioning processes,
some manufacturers have stored serial-numbers in other fields.
Registrars [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be configurable, on a per-manufacturer
basis, to look for serial-number equivalents in other
fields.[¶](#section-2.3.1-6){.pilcrow}

As explained in [Section 5.5](#RequestVoucherFromMASA){.xref}, the
registrar [MUST]{.bcp14} again extract the serialNumber itself from the
pledge\'s TLS certificate. It can consult the serial-number in the
pledge request if there is any possible confusion about the source of
the serial-number.[¶](#section-2.3.1-7){.pilcrow}

This document defines a new PKIX non-critical certificate extension to
carry the MASA URI. This extension is intended to be used in the IDevID
certificate. The URI is represented as described in [Section
7.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5280#section-7.4){.relref} of
\[[RFC5280](#RFC5280){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2.3.2-1){.pilcrow}

A complete URI [MAY]{.bcp14} be in this extension, including the
\"scheme\", \"authority\", and \"path\". The complete URI will typically
be used in diagnostic or experimental situations. Typically (and in
consideration to constrained systems), this [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be reduced
to only the \"authority\", in which case a scheme of \"https://\" (see
\[[RFC7230](#RFC7230){.xref}\], [Section

The registrar can assume that only the \"authority\" is present in the

On initial bootstrap, a new device (the pledge) uses a local service
auto-discovery (the GeneRic Autonomic Signaling Protocol (GRASP) or
Multicast DNS (mDNS)) to locate a Join Proxy. The Join Proxy connects
the pledge to a local registrar (the JRC).[¶](#section-2.4-3){.pilcrow}

Having found a candidate registrar, the fledgling pledge sends some
information about itself to the registrar, including its serial number
in the form of a voucher-request and its IDevID certificate as part of
the TLS session.[¶](#section-2.4-4){.pilcrow}

The registrar can determine whether it expected such a device to appear
and locates a MASA. The location of the MASA is usually found in an
extension in the IDevID. Having determined that the MASA is suitable,
the entire information from the initial voucher-request (including the
device\'s serial number) is transmitted over the Internet in a
TLS-protected channel to the manufacturer, along with information about
the registrar/owner.[¶](#section-2.4-5){.pilcrow}

The manufacturer can then apply policy based on the provided
information, as well as other sources of information (such as sales
records), to decide whether to approve the claim by the registrar to own
the device; if the claim is accepted, a voucher is issued that directs
the device to accept its new owner.[¶](#section-2.4-6){.pilcrow}

The voucher is returned to the registrar, but not immediately to the
device \-- the registrar has an opportunity to examine the voucher, the
MASA\'s audit-logs, and other sources of information to determine
whether the device has been tampered with and whether the bootstrap
should be accepted.[¶](#section-2.4-7){.pilcrow}

No filtering of information is possible in the signed voucher, so this
is a binary yes-or-no decision. After the registrar has applied any
local policy to the voucher, if it accepts the voucher, then the voucher
is returned to the pledge for imprinting.[¶](#section-2.4-8){.pilcrow}

The voucher also includes a trust anchor that the pledge uses to
represent the owner. This is used to successfully bootstrap from an
environment where only the manufacturer has built-in trust by the device
to an environment where the owner now has a PKI footprint on the
device.[¶](#section-2.4-9){.pilcrow}

When BRSKI is followed with EST, this single footprint is further
leveraged into the full owner\'s PKI and an LDevID for the device.
Subsequent reporting steps provide flows of information to indicate
success/failure of the process.[¶](#section-2.4-10){.pilcrow}

When bootstrapping, many devices do not have knowledge of the current
time. Mechanisms such as Network Time Protocols cannot be secured until
bootstrapping is complete. Therefore, bootstrapping is defined with a
framework that does not require knowledge of the current time. A pledge
[MAY]{.bcp14} ignore all time stamps in the voucher and in the
certificate validity periods if it does not know the current
time.[¶](#section-2.6.1-1){.pilcrow}

The pledge is exposed to dates in the following five places: registrar
certificate notBefore, registrar certificate notAfter, voucher
created-on, and voucher expires-on. Additionally, Cryptographic Message
Syntax (CMS) signatures contain a
signingTime.[¶](#section-2.6.1-2){.pilcrow}

A pledge with a real-time clock in which it has confidence
[MUST]{.bcp14} check the above time fields in all certificates and
signatures that it processes.[¶](#section-2.6.1-3){.pilcrow}

If the voucher contains a nonce, then the pledge [MUST]{.bcp14} confirm
the nonce matches the original pledge voucher-request. This ensures the
voucher is fresh. See [Section
5.2](#RequestVoucherFromRegistrar){.xref}.[¶](#section-2.6.1-4){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC5280](#RFC5280){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2.6.2-1){.pilcrow}

Some deployed IDevID management systems are not compliant with the

### [2.7.](#section-2.7){.section-number .selfRef} [Cloud Registrar](#name-cloud-registrar){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-cloud-registrar}

There exist operationally open networks wherein devices gain
unauthenticated access to the Internet at large. In these use cases, the
management domain for the device needs to be discovered within the
larger Internet. The case where a device can boot and get access to a
larger Internet is less likely within the ANIMA ACP scope but may be
more important in the future. In the ANIMA ACP scope, new devices will
be quarantined behind a Join Proxy.[¶](#section-2.7-1){.pilcrow}

Additionally, there are some greenfield situations involving an entirely
new installation where a device may have some kind of management uplink
that it can use (such as via a 3G network, for instance). In such a
future situation, the device might use this management interface to
learn that it should configure itself to become the local
registrar.[¶](#section-2.7-2){.pilcrow}

In order to support these scenarios, the pledge [MAY]{.bcp14} contact a
well-known URI of a cloud registrar if a local registrar cannot be
discovered or if the pledge\'s target use cases do not include a local
registrar.[¶](#section-2.7-3){.pilcrow}

If the pledge uses a well-known URI for contacting a cloud registrar, a
manufacturer-assigned Implicit Trust Anchor database (see
\[[RFC7030](#RFC7030){.xref}\]) [MUST]{.bcp14} be used to authenticate
that service as described in \[[RFC6125](#RFC6125){.xref}\]. The use of
a DNS-ID for validation is appropriate, and it may include wildcard
components on the left-mode side. This is consistent with the human-user
configuration of an EST server URI in \[[RFC7030](#RFC7030){.xref}\],
which also depends on
\[[RFC6125](#RFC6125){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2.7-4){.pilcrow}

The registrar needs to be able to contact a MASA that is trusted by the
pledge in order to obtain vouchers.[¶](#section-2.8-1){.pilcrow}

The device\'s IDevID will normally contain the MASA URL as detailed in
[Section 2.3](#IDevIDextension){.xref}. This is the
[RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14} mechanism.[¶](#section-2.8-2){.pilcrow}

In some cases, it can be operationally difficult to ensure the necessary
X.509 extensions are in the pledge\'s IDevID due to the difficulty of
aligning current pledge manufacturing with software releases and
development; thus, as a final fallback, the registrar [MAY]{.bcp14} be
manually configured or distributed with a MASA URL for each
manufacturer. Note that the registrar can only select the configured
MASA URL based on the trust anchor \-- so manufacturers can only
leverage this approach if they ensure a single MASA URL works for all
pledges associated with each trust anchor.[¶](#section-2.8-3){.pilcrow}

## [3.](#section-3){.section-number .selfRef} [Voucher-Request Artifact](#name-voucher-request-artifact){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-voucher-request-artifact}

Voucher-requests are how vouchers are requested. The semantics of the
voucher-request are described below, in the YANG
module.[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

A pledge forms the \"pledge voucher-request\", signs it with its IDevID,
and submits it to the registrar.[¶](#section-3-2){.pilcrow}

In turn, the registrar forms the \"registrar voucher-request\", signs it
with its registrar key pair, and submits it to the
MASA.[¶](#section-3-3){.pilcrow}

The \"proximity-registrar-cert\" leaf is used in the pledge
voucher-requests. This provides a method for the pledge to assert the
registrar\'s proximity.[¶](#section-3-4){.pilcrow}

This network proximity results from the following properties in the ACP
context: the pledge is connected to the Join Proxy ([Section
4](#proxydetails){.xref}) using a link-local IPv6 connection. While the
Join Proxy does not participate in any meaningful sense in the
cryptography of the TLS connection (such as via a Channel Binding), the
registrar can observe that the connection is via the private ACP (ULA)
address of the Join Proxy, and it cannot come from outside the ACP. The
pledge must therefore be at most one IPv6 link-local hop away from an
existing node on the ACP.[¶](#section-3-5){.pilcrow}

Other users of BRSKI will need to define other kinds of assertions if
the network proximity described above does not match their
needs.[¶](#section-3-6){.pilcrow}

The \"prior-signed-voucher-request\" leaf is used in registrar
voucher-requests. If present, it is the signed pledge voucher-request
artifact. This provides a method for the registrar to forward the
pledge\'s signed request to the MASA. This completes transmission of the
signed proximity-registrar-cert leaf.[¶](#section-3-7){.pilcrow}

Unless otherwise signaled (outside the voucher-request artifact), the
signing structure is as defined for vouchers; see
\[[RFC8366](#RFC8366){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3-8){.pilcrow}

A registrar [MAY]{.bcp14} also retrieve nonceless vouchers by sending
nonceless voucher-requests to the MASA in order to obtain vouchers for
use when the registrar does not have connectivity to the MASA. No
prior-signed-voucher-request leaf would be included. The registrar will
also need to know the serial number of the pledge. This document does
not provide a mechanism for the registrar to learn that in an automated
fashion. Typically, this will be done via the scanning of a bar code or
QR code on packaging, or via some sales channel
integration.[¶](#section-3.1-1){.pilcrow}

This section is normative for uses with an ANIMA ACP. The use of the
GRASP mechanism is part of the ACP. Other users of BRSKI will need to
define an equivalent proxy mechanism and an equivalent mechanism to
configure the proxy.[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

The role of the proxy is to facilitate communications. The proxy
forwards packets between the pledge and a registrar that has been
provisioned to the proxy via full GRASP ACP
discovery.[¶](#section-4-2){.pilcrow}

This section defines a stateful proxy mechanism that is referred to as a
\"circuit\" proxy. This is a form of Application Level Gateway (see
\[[RFC2663](#RFC2663){.xref}\], [Section
2.9](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2663#section-2.9){.relref}).[¶](#section-4-3){.pilcrow}

The proxy does not terminate the TLS handshake: it passes streams of
bytes onward without examination. A proxy [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} assume any
specific TLS version. Please see \[[RFC8446](#RFC8446){.xref}\],
[Section
9.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8446#section-9.3){.relref} for
details on TLS invariants.[¶](#section-4-4){.pilcrow}

A registrar can directly provide the proxy announcements described
below, in which case the announced port can point directly to the
registrar itself. In this scenario, the pledge is unaware that there is
no proxying occurring. This is useful for registrars that are servicing
pledges on directly connected networks.[¶](#section-4-5){.pilcrow}

As a result of the proxy discovery process in [Section
4.1.1](#brskigrasp){.xref}, the port number exposed by the proxy does
not need to be well known or require an IANA
allocation.[¶](#section-4-6){.pilcrow}

During the discovery of the registrar by the Join Proxy, the Join Proxy
will also learn which kinds of proxy mechanisms are available. This will
allow the Join Proxy to use the lowest impact mechanism that the Join
Proxy and registrar have in common.[¶](#section-4-7){.pilcrow}

In order to permit the proxy functionality to be implemented on the
maximum variety of devices, the chosen mechanism should use the minimum
amount of state on the proxy device. While many devices in the ANIMA
target space will be rather large routers, the proxy function is likely
to be implemented in the control-plane CPU of such a device, with
available capabilities for the proxy function similar to many class 2
IoT devices.[¶](#section-4-8){.pilcrow}

The document
\[[ANIMA-STATE](#I-D.richardson-anima-state-for-joinrouter){.xref}\]

proxy methods.[¶](#section-4-9){.pilcrow}

### [4.1.](#section-4.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Pledge Discovery of Proxy](#name-pledge-discovery-of-proxy){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-pledge-discovery-of-proxy}

The result of discovery is a logical communication with a registrar,
through a proxy. The proxy is transparent to the pledge. The
communication between the pledge and Join Proxy is over IPv6 link-local
addresses.[¶](#section-4.1-1){.pilcrow}

To discover the proxy, the pledge performs the following
actions:[¶](#section-4.1-2){.pilcrow}

1.  [[MUST]{.bcp14}: Obtain a local address using IPv6 methods as
    described in \"IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration\"
    \[[RFC4862](#RFC4862){.xref}\]. Use of temporary addresses
    \[[RFC8981](#RFC8981){.xref}\] is encouraged. To limit pervasive
    monitoring \[[RFC7258](#RFC7258){.xref}\], a new temporary address
    [MAY]{.bcp14} use a short lifetime (that is, set
    TEMP_PREFERRED_LIFETIME to be short). Pledges will generally prefer
    use of IPv6 link-local addresses, and discovery of the proxy will be
    by link-local mechanisms. IPv4 methods are described in [Appendix
    A](#IPv4operations){.xref}.[¶](#section-4.1-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.1-3.1}
2.  [[MUST]{.bcp14}: Listen for GRASP M_FLOOD
    \[[RFC8990](#RFC8990){.xref}\] announcements of the objective:
    \"AN_Proxy\". See [Section 4.1.1](#brskigrasp){.xref} for the
    details of the objective. The pledge [MAY]{.bcp14} listen
    concurrently for other sources of information; see [Appendix
    B](#mdnsmethods){.xref}.[¶](#section-4.1-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.1-3.2}

Once a proxy is discovered, the pledge communicates with a registrar
through the proxy using the bootstrapping protocol defined in [Section
5](#ProtocolDetails){.xref}.[¶](#section-4.1-4){.pilcrow}

While the GRASP M_FLOOD mechanism is passive for the pledge, the
non-normative other methods (mDNS and IPv4 methods) described in
[Appendix B](#mdnsmethods){.xref} are active. The pledge
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} run those methods in parallel with listening for the
M_FLOOD. The active methods [SHOULD]{.bcp14} back off by doubling to a
maximum of one hour to avoid overloading the network with discovery
attempts. Detection of physical link status change (Ethernet carrier,
for instance) [SHOULD]{.bcp14} reset the back-off
timers.[¶](#section-4.1-5){.pilcrow}

The pledge could discover more than one proxy on a given physical
interface. The pledge can have a multitude of physical interfaces as
well: a Layer 2/3 Ethernet switch may have hundreds of physical
ports.[¶](#section-4.1-6){.pilcrow}

Each possible proxy offer [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be attempted up to the point
where a valid voucher is received: while there are many ways in which
the attempt may fail, it does not succeed until the voucher has been
validated.[¶](#section-4.1-7){.pilcrow}

The connection attempts via a single proxy [SHOULD]{.bcp14}
exponentially back off to a maximum of one hour to avoid overloading the
network infrastructure. The back-off timer for each [MUST]{.bcp14} be
independent of other connection attempts.[¶](#section-4.1-8){.pilcrow}

Connection attempts [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be run in parallel to avoid
head-of-queue problems wherein an attacker running a fake proxy or
registrar could intentionally perform protocol actions slowly.
Connection attempts to different proxies [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be sent with
an interval of 3 to 5s. The pledge [SHOULD]{.bcp14} continue to listen
for additional GRASP M_FLOOD messages during the connection
attempts.[¶](#section-4.1-9){.pilcrow}

Each connection attempt through a distinct Join Proxy [MUST]{.bcp14}
have a unique nonce in the
voucher-request.[¶](#section-4.1-10){.pilcrow}

Once a connection to a registrar is established (e.g., establishment of
a TLS session key), there are expectations of more timely responses; see
[Section
5.2](#RequestVoucherFromRegistrar){.xref}.[¶](#section-4.1-11){.pilcrow}

Once all discovered services are attempted (assuming that none
succeeded), the device [MUST]{.bcp14} return to listening for GRASP
M_FLOOD. It [SHOULD]{.bcp14} periodically retry any
manufacturer-specific mechanisms. The pledge [MAY]{.bcp14} prioritize
selection order as appropriate for the anticipated
environment.[¶](#section-4.1-12){.pilcrow}

BRSKI is described as extensions to EST \[[RFC7030](#RFC7030){.xref}\].
The goal of these extensions is to reduce the number of TLS connections
and crypto operations required on the pledge. The registrar implements
the BRSKI REST interface within the \"/.well-known/brski\" URI tree and
implements the existing EST URIs as described in EST
\[[RFC7030](#RFC7030){.xref}\], [Section
3.2.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7030#section-3.2.2){.relref}.
The communication channel between the pledge and the registrar is
referred to as \"BRSKI-EST\" (see [Figure
1](#architecturefigure){.xref}).[¶](#section-5-2){.pilcrow}

The communication channel between the registrar and MASA is a new
communication channel, similar to EST, within the newly registered
\"/.well-known/brski\" tree. For clarity, this channel is referred to as
\"BRSKI-MASA\" (see [Figure
1](#architecturefigure){.xref}).[¶](#section-5-3){.pilcrow}

The MASA URI is \"https://\" authority
\"/.well-known/brski\".[¶](#section-5-4){.pilcrow}

BRSKI uses existing CMS message formats for existing EST operations.
BRSKI uses JSON \[[RFC8259](#RFC8259){.xref}\] for all new operations
defined here and for voucher formats. In all places where a binary value
must be carried in a JSON string, a base64 format
(\[[RFC4648](#RFC4648){.xref}\], [Section
4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4648#section-4){.relref}) is to be
used, as per \[[RFC7951](#RFC7951){.xref}\], [Section
6.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7951#section-6.6){.relref}.[¶](#section-5-5){.pilcrow}

While EST (\[[RFC7030](#RFC7030){.xref}\], [Section
3.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7030#section-3.2){.relref}) does
not insist upon use of HTTP persistent connections
(\[[RFC7230](#RFC7230){.xref}\], [Section
6.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7230#section-6.3){.relref}),
BRSKI-EST connections [SHOULD]{.bcp14} use persistent connections. The
intention of this guidance is to ensure the provisional TLS state occurs
only once, and that the subsequent resolution of the provision state is
not subject to a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack during a critical
phase.[¶](#section-5-6){.pilcrow}

If non-persistent connections are used, then both the pledge and the
registrar [MUST]{.bcp14} remember the certificates that have been seen
and also sent for the first connection. They [MUST]{.bcp14} check each
subsequent connection for the same certificates, and each end
[MUST]{.bcp14} use the same certificates as well. This places a
difficult restriction on rolling certificates on the
registrar.[¶](#section-5-7){.pilcrow}

Summarized automation extensions for the BRSKI-EST flow
are:[¶](#section-5-8){.pilcrow}

-   [The pledge either attempts concurrent connections via each
    discovered proxy or times out quickly and tries connections in
    series, as explained at the end of [Section

The pledge establishes the TLS connection with the registrar through the
Circuit Proxy (see [Section 4](#proxydetails){.xref}), but the TLS
handshake is with the registrar. The BRSKI-EST pledge is the TLS client,
and the BRSKI-EST registrar is the TLS server. All security associations
established are between the pledge and the registrar regardless of proxy
operations.[¶](#section-5.1-1){.pilcrow}

Use of TLS 1.3 (or newer) is encouraged. TLS 1.2 or newer is
[REQUIRED]{.bcp14} on the pledge side. TLS 1.3 (or newer)
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} be available on the registrar server interface, and the
registrar client interface, but TLS 1.2 [MAY]{.bcp14} be used. TLS 1.3
(or newer) [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be available on the MASA server interface,
but TLS 1.2 [MAY]{.bcp14} be used.[¶](#section-5.1-2){.pilcrow}

Establishment of the BRSKI-EST TLS connection is as specified in
\"Bootstrap Distribution of CA Certificates\" (Section
[4.1.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7030#section-4.1.1){.relref})
of \[[RFC7030](#RFC7030){.xref}\], wherein the client is authenticated
with the IDevID certificate, and the EST server (the registrar) is
provisionally authenticated with an unverified server certificate.
Configuration or distribution of the trust anchor database used for
validating the IDevID certificate is out of scope of this specification.
Note that the trust anchors in / excluded from the database will affect
which manufacturers\' devices are acceptable to the registrar as pledges
and can also be used to limit the set of MASAs that are trusted for
enrollment.[¶](#section-5.1-3){.pilcrow}

The signature in the certificate [MUST]{.bcp14} be validated even if a
signing key cannot (yet) be validated. The certificate (or chain)
[MUST]{.bcp14} be retained for later
validation.[¶](#section-5.1-4){.pilcrow}

A self-signed certificate for the registrar is acceptable as the voucher
can validate it upon successful enrollment.[¶](#section-5.1-5){.pilcrow}

The pledge performs input validation of all data received until a
voucher is verified as specified in [Section
5.6.1](#CompletingAuthenticationBootstrapping){.xref} and the TLS
connection leaves the provisional state. Until these operations are
complete, the pledge could be communicating with an
attacker.[¶](#section-5.1-6){.pilcrow}

The pledge code needs to be written with the assumption that all data is
being transmitted at this point to an unauthenticated peer, and that
received data, while inside a TLS connection, [MUST]{.bcp14} be
considered untrusted. This particularly applies to HTTP headers and CMS
structures that make up the voucher.[¶](#section-5.1-7){.pilcrow}

A pledge that can connect to multiple registrars concurrently
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} do so. Some devices may be unable to do so for lack of
threading, or resource issues. Concurrent connections defeat attempts by
a malicious proxy from causing a TCP Slowloris-like attack (see
\[[slowloris](#slowloris){.xref}\]).[¶](#section-5.1-8){.pilcrow}

A pledge that cannot maintain as many connections as there are eligible
proxies will need to rotate among the various choices, terminating
connections that do not appear to be making progress. If no connection
is making progress after 5 seconds, then the pledge [SHOULD]{.bcp14}
drop the oldest connection and go on to a different proxy: the proxy
that has been communicated with least recently. If there were no other
proxies discovered, the pledge [MAY]{.bcp14} continue to wait, as long
as it is concurrently listening for new proxy
announcements.[¶](#section-5.1-9){.pilcrow}

In a fully automated network, all devices must be securely identified
and authorized to join the domain.[¶](#section-5.3-1){.pilcrow}

A registrar accepts or declines a request to join the domain, based on
the authenticated identity presented. For different networks, examples
of automated acceptance may include the allowance
of:[¶](#section-5.3-2){.pilcrow}

-   [any device of a specific type (as determined by the X.509

-   [a specific device from a vendor (as determined by the X.509 IDevID)
    against a domain acceptlist. (The mechanism for checking a shared
    acceptlist potentially used by multiple registrars is out of
    scope.)[¶](#section-5.3-3.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.3-3.3}

If validation fails, the registrar [SHOULD]{.bcp14} respond with the
HTTP 404 error code. If the voucher-request is in an unknown format,
then an HTTP 406 error code is more appropriate. A situation that could
be resolved with administrative action (such as adding a vendor to an
acceptlist) [MAY]{.bcp14} be responded to with a 403 HTTP error
code.[¶](#section-5.3-4){.pilcrow}

If authorization is successful, the registrar obtains a voucher from the
MASA service (see [Section 5.5](#RequestVoucherFromMASA){.xref}) and
returns that MASA-signed voucher to the pledge as described in [Section

The BRSKI-MASA TLS connection is a \"normal\" TLS connection appropriate
for HTTPS REST interfaces. The registrar initiates the connection and
uses the MASA URL that is obtained as described in [Section
2.8](#obtainmasaurl){.xref}. The mechanisms in
\[[RFC6125](#RFC6125){.xref}\] [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be used in
authentication of the MASA using a DNS-ID that matches that which is
found in the IDevID. Registrars [MAY]{.bcp14} include a mechanism to
override the MASA URL on a manufacturer-by-manufacturer basis, and
within that override, it is appropriate to provide alternate anchors.
This will typically be used by some vendors to establish explicit (or
private) trust anchors for validating their MASA that is part of a sales
channel integration.[¶](#section-5.4-1){.pilcrow}

Use of TLS 1.3 (or newer) is encouraged. TLS 1.2 or newer is
[REQUIRED]{.bcp14}. TLS 1.3 (or newer) [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be
available.[¶](#section-5.4-2){.pilcrow}

As described in \[[RFC7030](#RFC7030){.xref}\], the MASA and the
registrars [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be prepared to support TLS Client
Certificate authentication and/or HTTP Basic, Digest, or Salted
Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM) authentication. This
connection [MAY]{.bcp14} also have no client authentication at
all.[¶](#section-5.4-3){.pilcrow}

Registrars [SHOULD]{.bcp14} permit trust anchors to be preconfigured on
a per-vendor (MASA) basis. Registrars [SHOULD]{.bcp14} include the
ability to configure a TLS Client Certificate on a per-MASA basis, or to
use no Client Certificate. Registrars [SHOULD]{.bcp14} also permit HTTP
Basic and Digest authentication to be
configured.[¶](#section-5.4-4){.pilcrow}

The authentication of the BRSKI-MASA connection does not change the
voucher-request process, as voucher-requests are already signed by the
registrar. Instead, this authentication provides access control to the
audit-log as described in [Section
5.8](#authzLogRequest){.xref}.[¶](#section-5.4-5){.pilcrow}

Implementers are advised that contacting the MASA establishes a secured
API connection with a web service, and that there are a number of
authentication models being explored within the industry. Registrars are
[RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14} to fail gracefully and generate useful
administrative notifications or logs in the advent of unexpected HTTP
401 (Unauthorized) responses from the MASA.[¶](#section-5.4-6){.pilcrow}

Providing per-customer options requires the customer\'s registrar to be
uniquely identified. This can be done by any stateless method that HTTPS
supports such as HTTP Basic or Digest authentication (that is using a
password), but the use of TLS Client Certificate authentication is
[RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14}.[¶](#section-5.4.1-1){.pilcrow}

Stateful methods involving API tokens, or HTTP Cookies, are not
recommended.[¶](#section-5.4.1-2){.pilcrow}

It is expected that the setup and configuration of per-customer Client
Certificates is done as part of a sales ordering
process.[¶](#section-5.4.1-3){.pilcrow}

The use of public PKI (i.e., WebPKI) end-entity certificates to identify
the registrar is reasonable, and if done universally, this would permit
a MASA to identify a customer\'s registrar simply by a Fully Qualified
Domain Name (FQDN).[¶](#section-5.4.1-4){.pilcrow}

The use of DANE records in DNSSEC-signed zones would also permit use of
a FQDN to identify customer registrars.[¶](#section-5.4.1-5){.pilcrow}

A third (and simplest, but least flexible) mechanism would be for the
MASA to simply store the registrar\'s certificate pinned in a
database.[¶](#section-5.4.1-6){.pilcrow}

A MASA without any supply-chain integration can simply accept registrars
without any authentication or on a blind TOFU basis as described in
[Section
7.4.2](#masasecurityreduction_tofu){.xref}.[¶](#section-5.4.1-7){.pilcrow}

This document does not make a specific recommendation on how the MASA
authenticates the registrar as there are likely different tradeoffs in
different environments and product values. Even within the ANIMA ACP

### [5.5.](#section-5.5){.section-number .selfRef} [Registrar Requests Voucher from MASA](#name-registrar-requests-voucher-){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-registrar-requests-voucher-}

When a registrar receives a pledge voucher-request, it in turn submits a
registrar voucher-request to the MASA service via an HTTPS interface
\[[RFC7231](#RFC7231){.xref}\].[¶](#section-5.5-1){.pilcrow}

This is done with an HTTP POST using the operation path value of
\"/.well-known/brski/requestvoucher\".[¶](#section-5.5-2){.pilcrow}

The voucher media type \"application/voucher-cms+json\" is defined in
\[[RFC8366](#RFC8366){.xref}\] and is also used for the registrar
voucher-request. It is a JSON document that has been signed using a CMS
structure. The registrar [MUST]{.bcp14} sign the registrar
voucher-request.[¶](#section-5.5-3){.pilcrow}

MASA implementations [SHOULD]{.bcp14} anticipate future media ntypes
but, of course, will simply fail the request if those types are not yet
known.[¶](#section-5.5-4){.pilcrow}

The voucher-request CMS object includes some number of certificates that
are input to the MASA as it populates the pinned-domain-cert. As
\[[RFC8366](#RFC8366){.xref}\] is quite flexible in what may be put into
the pinned-domain-cert, the MASA needs some signal as to what
certificate would be effective to populate the field with: it may range
from the end-entity certificate that the registrar uses to the entire
private Enterprise CA certificate. More-specific certificates result in
a tighter binding of the voucher to the domain, while less-specific
certificates result in more flexibility in how the domain is represented
by certificates.[¶](#section-5.5-5){.pilcrow}

A registrar that is seeking a nonceless voucher for later offline use
benefits from a less-specific certificate, as it permits the actual key
pair used by a future registrar to be determined by the pinned
CA.[¶](#section-5.5-6){.pilcrow}

In some cases, a less-specific certificate, such as a public WebPKI CA,
could be too open and could permit any entity issued a certificate by
that authority to assume ownership of a device that has a voucher
pinned. Future work may provide a solution to pin both a certificate and
a name that would reduce such risk of malicious ownership
assertions.[¶](#section-5.5-7){.pilcrow}

The registrar [SHOULD]{.bcp14} request a voucher with the most
specificity consistent with the mode that it is operating in. In order
to do this, when the registrar prepares the CMS structure for the signed
voucher-request, it [SHOULD]{.bcp14} include only certificates that are
a part of the chain that it wishes the MASA to pin. This [MAY]{.bcp14}
be as small as only the end-entity certificate (with id-kp-cmcRA set)
that it uses as its TLS server certificate, or it [MAY]{.bcp14} be the
entire chain, including the domain CA.[¶](#section-5.5-8){.pilcrow}

The registrar [SHOULD]{.bcp14} include an \"Accept\" header field (see
\[[RFC7231](#RFC7231){.xref}\], [Section
5.3.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7231#section-5.3.2){.relref})
indicating the response media types that are acceptable. This list
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} be the entire list presented to the registrar in the
pledge\'s original request (see [Section
5.2](#RequestVoucherFromRegistrar){.xref}), but it [MAY]{.bcp14} be a
subset. The MASA is expected to be flexible in what it
accepts.[¶](#section-5.5-9){.pilcrow}

The registrar populates the voucher-request fields as
follows:[¶](#section-5.5-10){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

created-on:
:   The registrar [SHOULD]{.bcp14} populate this field with the current

serial-number:
:   The serial number of the pledge the registrar would like a voucher
    for. The registrar determines this value by parsing the
    authenticated pledge IDevID certificate; see [Section
    2.3](#IDevIDextension){.xref}. The registrar [MUST]{.bcp14} verify
    that the serial-number field it parsed matches the serial-number
    field the pledge provided in its voucher-request. This provides a
    sanity check useful for detecting error conditions and logging. The
    registrar [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} simply copy the serial-number field
    from a pledge voucher-request as that field is claimed but not
    certified.[¶](#section-5.5-11.6){.pilcrow}
:   

idevid-issuer:
:   The Issuer value from the pledge IDevID certificate is included to
    ensure unique interpretation of the serial-number. In the case of a

    be configured from the same out-of-band source as the
    serial-number.[¶](#section-5.5-11.8){.pilcrow}

A nonceless registrar voucher-request [MAY]{.bcp14} be submitted to the
MASA. Doing so allows the registrar to request a voucher when the pledge
is offline, or when the registrar anticipates not being able to connect
to the MASA while the pledge is being deployed. Some use cases require
the registrar to learn the appropriate IDevID serialNumber field and
appropriate \"Accept\" header field values from the physical device
labeling or from the sales channel (which is out of scope for this
document).[¶](#section-5.5-12){.pilcrow}

The MASA verifies that the registrar voucher-request is internally
consistent but does not necessarily authenticate the registrar
certificate since the registrar [MAY]{.bcp14} be unknown to the MASA in
advance. The MASA performs the actions and validation checks described
in the following subsections before issuing a

As described in \[[RFC8366](#RFC8366){.xref}\], vouchers are normally
short lived to avoid revocation issues. If the request is for a previous
(expired) voucher using the same registrar (that is, a registrar with
the same domain CA), then the request for a renewed voucher
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} be automatically authorized. The MASA has sufficient
information to determine this by examining the request, the registrar
authentication, and the existing audit-log. The issuance of a renewed
voucher is logged as detailed in [Section
5.6](#VoucherResponse){.xref}.[¶](#section-5.5.1-1){.pilcrow}

To inform the MASA that existing vouchers are not to be renewed, one can
update or revoke the registrar credentials used to authorize the request
(see Sections [5.5.4](#MASAauthenticationOfRegistrar){.xref} and

certificate, up to the entire registrar certificate chain, including the
domain CA certificate, as specified in [Section
5.5](#RequestVoucherFromMASA){.xref}.[¶](#section-5.5.2-1){.pilcrow}

If the domain\'s CA is unknown to the MASA, then it is considered a
temporary trust anchor for the rest of the steps in this section. The
intention is not to authenticate the message as having come from a fully
validated origin but to establish the consistency of the domain
PKI.[¶](#section-5.5.2-2){.pilcrow}

The MASA [MAY]{.bcp14} use the certificate in the chain that is farthest
from the end-entity certificate of the registrar, as determined by MASA
policy. A MASA [MAY]{.bcp14} have a local policy in which it only pins
the end-entity certificate. This is consistent with
\[[RFC8366](#RFC8366){.xref}\]. Details of the policy will typically

\[[RFC7030](#RFC7030){.xref}\], [Section

exists in the certificate of the entity that signed the registrar
voucher-request. This verification is only a consistency check to ensure
that the unauthenticated domain CA intended the voucher-request signer
to be a registrar. Performing this check provides value to the domain
PKI by assuring the domain administrator that the MASA service will only
respect claims from authorized registration authorities of the
domain.[¶](#section-5.5.4-1){.pilcrow}

Even when a domain CA is authenticated to the MASA, and there is strong
sales channel integration to understand who the legitimate owner is, the
above id-kp-cmcRA check prevents arbitrary end-entity certificates (such
as an LDevID certificate) from having vouchers issued against
them.[¶](#section-5.5.4-2){.pilcrow}

Other cases of inappropriate voucher issuance are detected by
examination of the audit-log.[¶](#section-5.5.4-3){.pilcrow}

If a nonceless voucher-request is submitted, the MASA [MUST]{.bcp14}
authenticate the registrar either as described in EST (see Sections

accept future voucher formats that are opaque to the
registrar.[¶](#section-5.6-3){.pilcrow}

If the voucher-request is successful, the server (a MASA responding to a
registrar or a registrar responding to a pledge) response [MUST]{.bcp14}
contain an HTTP 200 response code. The server [MUST]{.bcp14} answer with
a suitable 4xx or 5xx HTTP \[[RFC7230](#RFC7230){.xref}\] error code
when a problem occurs. In this case, the response data from the MASA
[MUST]{.bcp14} be a plain text human-readable (UTF-8) error message
containing explanatory information describing why the request was
rejected.[¶](#section-5.6-4){.pilcrow}

The registrar [MAY]{.bcp14} respond with an HTTP 202 (\"the request has
been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been
completed\") as described in EST \[[RFC7030](#RFC7030){.xref}\],
[Section
4.2.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7030#section-4.2.3){.relref},
wherein the client \"[MUST]{.bcp14} wait at least the specified
\"retry-after\" time before repeating the same request\" (also see
\[[RFC7231](#RFC7231){.xref}\], [Section
6.6.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7231#section-6.6.4){.relref}).
The pledge is [RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14} to provide local feedback (blinked
LED, etc.) during this wait cycle if mechanisms for this are available.
To prevent an attacker registrar from significantly delaying
bootstrapping, the pledge [MUST]{.bcp14} limit the Retry-After time to
60 seconds. Ideally, the pledge would keep track of the appropriate
Retry-After header field values for any number of outstanding
registrars, but this would involve a state table on the pledge. Instead,
the pledge [MAY]{.bcp14} ignore the exact Retry-After value in favor of
a single hard-coded value (a registrar that is unable to complete the
transaction after the first 60 seconds has another chance a minute
later). A pledge [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be willing to maintain a 202
retry-state for up to 4 days, which is longer than a long weekend, after
which time the enrollment attempt fails, and the pledge returns to
Discovery state. This allows time for an alert to get from the registrar
to a human operator who can make a decision as to whether or not to
proceed with the enrollment.[¶](#section-5.6-5){.pilcrow}

A pledge that retries a request after receiving a 202 message
[MUST]{.bcp14} resend the same voucher-request. It [MUST NOT]{.bcp14}
sign a new voucher-request each time, and in particular, it [MUST
NOT]{.bcp14} change the nonce value.[¶](#section-5.6-6){.pilcrow}

In order to avoid infinite redirect loops, which a malicious registrar
might do in order to keep the pledge from discovering the correct
registrar, the pledge [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} follow more than one
redirection (3xx code) to another web origin. EST supports redirection
but requires user input; this change allows the pledge to follow a
single redirection without a user
interaction.[¶](#section-5.6-7){.pilcrow}

A 403 (Forbidden) response is appropriate if the voucher-request is not
signed correctly or is stale or if the pledge has another outstanding
voucher that cannot be overridden.[¶](#section-5.6-8){.pilcrow}

A 404 (Not Found) response is appropriate when the request is for a
device that is not known to the MASA.[¶](#section-5.6-9){.pilcrow}

A 406 (Not Acceptable) response is appropriate if a voucher of the
desired type or that uses the desired algorithms (as indicated by the
\"Accept\" header fields and algorithms used in the signature) cannot be
issued as such because the MASA knows the pledge cannot process that
type. The registrar [SHOULD]{.bcp14} use this response if it determines
the pledge is unacceptable due to inventory control, MASA audit-logs, or
any other reason.[¶](#section-5.6-10){.pilcrow}

A 415 (Unsupported Media Type) response is appropriate for a request
that has a voucher-request or \"Accept\" value that is not
understood.[¶](#section-5.6-11){.pilcrow}

The voucher response format is as indicated in the submitted \"Accept\"
header fields or based on the MASA\'s prior understanding of proper
format for this pledge. Only the \"application/voucher-cms+json\" media
type \[[RFC8366](#RFC8366){.xref}\] is defined at this time. The
syntactic details of vouchers are described in detail in
\[[RFC8366](#RFC8366){.xref}\]. [Figure 14](#voucherjsonexample){.xref}

The MASA populates the voucher fields as
follows:[¶](#section-5.6-14){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

nonce:
:   The nonce from the pledge if available. See [Section
    5.5.6](#MASAnoncehandling){.xref}.[¶](#section-5.6-15.2){.pilcrow}
:   

assertion:
:   The method used to verify the relationship between the pledge and

:   

pinned-domain-cert:
:   A certificate; see [Section 5.5.2](#MASApinned){.xref}. This figure
    is illustrative; for an example, see [Appendix
    C.2](#exampleprocess){.xref} where an end-entity certificate is
    used.[¶](#section-5.6-15.6){.pilcrow}
:   

serial-number:
:   The serial-number as provided in the voucher-request. Also see
    [Section
    5.5.5](#MASAassertion){.xref}.[¶](#section-5.6-15.8){.pilcrow}
:   

domain-cert-revocation-checks:
:   Set as appropriate for the pledge\'s capabilities and as documented
    in \[[RFC8366](#RFC8366){.xref}\]. The MASA [MAY]{.bcp14} set this
    field to \"false\" since setting it to \"true\" would require that
    revocation information be available to the pledge, and this document
    does not make normative requirements for
    \[[RFC6961](#RFC6961){.xref}\], [Section
    4.4.2.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8446#section-4.4.2.1){.relref}

    integrations.[¶](#section-5.6-15.10){.pilcrow}
:   

expires-on:
:   This is set for nonceless vouchers. The MASA ensures the voucher
    lifetime is consistent with any revocation or pinned-domain-cert
    consistency checks the pledge might perform. See [Section
    2.6.1](#timeunknown){.xref}. There are three times to consider: (a)
    a configured voucher lifetime in the MASA, (b) the expiry time for
    the registrar\'s certificate, and (c) any CRL lifetime. The
    expires-on field [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be before the earliest of these
    three values. Typically, (b) will be some significant time in the
    future, but (c) will typically be short (on the order of a week or
    less). The [RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14} period for (a) is on the order of
    20 minutes, so it will typically determine the life span of the
    resulting voucher. 20 minutes is sufficient time to reach the
    post-provisional state in the pledge, at which point there is an
    established trust relationship between the pledge and registrar. The
    subsequent operations can take as long as required from that point
    onwards. The lifetime of the voucher has no impact on the life span
    of the ownership relationship.[¶](#section-5.6-15.12){.pilcrow}
:   

Whenever a voucher is issued, the MASA [MUST]{.bcp14} update the
audit-log sufficiently to generate the response as described in [Section

maintain the audit-log are out of scope.[¶](#section-5.6-16){.pilcrow}

serial-number.[¶](#section-5.6.1-2){.pilcrow}

The pledge [MUST]{.bcp14} verify the nonce information in the voucher.
If present, the nonce in the voucher must match the nonce the pledge
submitted to the registrar; vouchers with no nonce can also be accepted
(according to local policy; see [Section

Following the process described in \[[RFC8366](#RFC8366){.xref}\], the
pledge should consider the public key from the pinned-domain-cert as the
sole temporary trust anchor.[¶](#section-5.6.2-1){.pilcrow}

The pledge then evaluates the TLS server certificate chain that it
received when the TLS connection was formed using this trust anchor. It
is possible that the public key in the pinned-domain-cert directly
matches the public key in the end-entity certificate provided by the TLS
server.[¶](#section-5.6.2-2){.pilcrow}

If a registrar\'s credentials cannot be verified using the
pinned-domain-cert trust anchor from the voucher, then the TLS
connection is discarded, and the pledge abandons attempts to bootstrap
with this discovered registrar. The pledge [SHOULD]{.bcp14} send voucher
status telemetry (described below) before closing the TLS connection.
The pledge [MUST]{.bcp14} attempt to enroll using any other proxies it
has found. It [SHOULD]{.bcp14} return to the same proxy again after
unsuccessful attempts with other proxies. Attempts should be made at
repeated intervals according to the back-off timer described earlier.
Attempts [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be repeated as failure may be the result of a
temporary inconsistency (an inconsistently rolled registrar key, or some
other misconfiguration). The inconsistency could also be the result of
an active MITM attack on the EST
connection.[¶](#section-5.6.2-3){.pilcrow}

The registrar [MUST]{.bcp14} use a certificate that chains to the
pinned-domain-cert as its TLS server
certificate.[¶](#section-5.6.2-4){.pilcrow}

The pledge\'s PKIX path validation of a registrar certificate\'s
validity period information is as described in [Section
2.6.1](#timeunknown){.xref}. Once the PKIX path validation is
successful, the TLS connection is no longer
provisional.[¶](#section-5.6.2-5){.pilcrow}

The pinned-domain-cert [MAY]{.bcp14} be installed as a trust anchor for
future operations such as enrollment (e.g., as recommended per
\[[RFC7030](#RFC7030){.xref}\]) or trust anchor management or raw
protocols that do not need full PKI-based key management. It can be used
to authenticate any dynamically discovered EST server that contains the
id-kp-cmcRA extended key usage extension as detailed in EST (see
\[[RFC7030](#RFC7030){.xref}\], [Section
3.6.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7030#section-3.6.1){.relref});
but to reduce system complexity, the pledge [SHOULD]{.bcp14} avoid
additional discovery operations. Instead, the pledge [SHOULD]{.bcp14}
communicate directly with the registrar as the EST server. The
pinned-domain-cert is not a complete distribution of the CA certificate
response, as described in \[[RFC7030](#RFC7030){.xref}\], [Section
4.1.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7030#section-4.1.3){.relref},

The domain is expected to provide indications to the system
administrators concerning device life-cycle status. To facilitate this,
it needs telemetry information concerning the device\'s
status.[¶](#section-5.7-1){.pilcrow}

The pledge [MUST]{.bcp14} indicate its pledge status regarding the
voucher. It does this by sending a status message to the
registrar.[¶](#section-5.7-2){.pilcrow}

The posted data media type:
application/json[¶](#section-5.7-3){.pilcrow}

The client sends an HTTP POST to the server at the URI
\".well-known/brski/voucher_status\".[¶](#section-5.7-4){.pilcrow}

The format and semantics described below are for version 1. A version
field is included to permit significant changes to this feedback in the
future. A registrar that receives a status message with a version larger
than it knows about [SHOULD]{.bcp14} log the contents and alert a
human.[¶](#section-5.7-5){.pilcrow}

The status field indicates if the voucher was acceptable. Boolean values
are acceptable, where \"true\" indicates the voucher was
acceptable.[¶](#section-5.7-6){.pilcrow}

If the voucher was not acceptable, the Reason string indicates why. In a
failure case, this message may be sent to an unauthenticated,
potentially malicious registrar; therefore, the Reason string [SHOULD
NOT]{.bcp14} provide information beneficial to an attacker. The
operational benefit of this telemetry information is balanced against
the operational costs of not recording that a voucher was ignored by a
client that the registrar expected was going to continue joining the
domain.[¶](#section-5.7-7){.pilcrow}

The reason-context attribute is an arbitrary JSON object (literal value
or hash of values) that provides additional information specific to this
pledge. The contents of this field are not subject to
standardization.[¶](#section-5.7-8){.pilcrow}

The version and status fields [MUST]{.bcp14} be present. The Reason
field [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be present whenever the status field is false.
The Reason-Context field is optional. In the case of a SUCCESS, the
Reason string [MAY]{.bcp14} be omitted.[¶](#section-5.7-9){.pilcrow}

After receiving the pledge status telemetry (see [Section
5.7](#pledgestatus){.xref}), the registrar [SHOULD]{.bcp14} request the
MASA audit-log from the MASA service.[¶](#section-5.8-1){.pilcrow}

This is done with an HTTP POST using the operation path value of
\"/.well-known/brski/requestauditlog\".[¶](#section-5.8-2){.pilcrow}

The registrar [SHOULD]{.bcp14} HTTP POST the same registrar
voucher-request as it did when requesting a voucher (using the same
Content-Type). It is posted to the /requestauditlog URI instead. The
idevid-issuer and serial-number informs the MASA which log is requested,
so the appropriate log can be prepared for the response. Using the same
media type and message minimizes cryptographic and message operations,
although it results in additional network traffic. The relying MASA
implementation [MAY]{.bcp14} leverage internal state to associate this
request with the original, and by now already validated, voucher-request
so as to avoid an extra crypto validation.[¶](#section-5.8-3){.pilcrow}

A registrar [MAY]{.bcp14} request logs at future times. If the registrar
generates a new request, then the MASA is forced to perform the
additional cryptographic operations to verify the new
request.[¶](#section-5.8-4){.pilcrow}

A MASA that receives a request for a device that does not exist, or for
which the requesting owner was never an owner, returns an HTTP 404
(\"Not found\") code.[¶](#section-5.8-5){.pilcrow}

It is reasonable for a registrar, that the MASA does not believe to be
the current owner, to request the audit-log. There are probably reasons
for this, which are hard to predict in advance. For instance, such a
registrar may not be aware that the device has been resold; it may be
that the device has been resold inappropriately, and this is how the
original owner will learn of the occurrence. It is also possible that
the device legitimately spends time in two different
networks.[¶](#section-5.8-6){.pilcrow}

Rather than returning the audit-log as a response to the POST (with a
return code 200), the MASA [MAY]{.bcp14} instead return a 201
(\"Created\") response (\[[RFC7231](#RFC7231){.xref}\], Sections
[6.3.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7231#section-6.3.2){.relref}
and [7.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7231#section-7.1){.relref}),
with the URL to the prepared (and idempotent, therefore cachable) audit
response in the \"Location\" header field.[¶](#section-5.8-7){.pilcrow}

In order to avoid enumeration of device audit-logs, a MASA that returns
URLs [SHOULD]{.bcp14} take care to make the returned URL unguessable.
\[[W3C.capability-urls](#W3C.capability-urls){.xref}\] provides very
good additional guidance. For instance, rather than returning URLs
containing a database number such as https://example.com/auditlog/1234
or the Extended Unique Identifier (EUI) of the device such
https://example.com/auditlog/10-00-00-11-22-33, the MASA
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} return a randomly generated value (a \"slug\" in web
parlance). The value is used to find the relevant database
entry.[¶](#section-5.8-8){.pilcrow}

A MASA that returns a code 200 [MAY]{.bcp14} also include a \"Location\"
header for future reference by the
registrar.[¶](#section-5.8-9){.pilcrow}

The domainID is a binary SubjectKeyIdentifier value calculated according
to [Section 5.8.2](#domainID){.xref}. It is encoded once in base64 in
order to be transported in this JSON
container.[¶](#section-5.8.1-6){.pilcrow}

The date is formatted per \[[RFC3339](#RFC3339){.xref}\], which is
consistent with typical JavaScript usage of
JSON.[¶](#section-5.8.1-7){.pilcrow}

The truncation structure [MAY]{.bcp14} be omitted if all values are
zero. Any counter missing from the truncation structure is assumed to be
zero.[¶](#section-5.8.1-8){.pilcrow}

The nonce is a string, as provided in the voucher-request, and is used
in the voucher. If no nonce was placed in the resulting voucher, then a
value of null [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be used in preference to omitting the
entry. While the nonce is often created as a base64-encoded random
series of bytes, this should not be
assumed.[¶](#section-5.8.1-9){.pilcrow}

Distribution of a large log is less than ideal. This structure can be
optimized as follows: nonced or nonceless entries for the same domainID
[MAY]{.bcp14} be abridged from the log leaving only the single most
recent nonced or nonceless entry for that domainID. In the case of
truncation, the \"event\" truncation value [SHOULD]{.bcp14} contain a
count of the number of events for this domainID that were omitted. The
log [SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} be further reduced, but an operational
situation could exist where maintaining the full log is not possible. In
such situations, the log [MAY]{.bcp14} be arbitrarily abridged for
length, with the number of removed entries indicated as
\"arbitrary\".[¶](#section-5.8.1-10){.pilcrow}

If the truncation count exceeds 1024, then the MASA [MAY]{.bcp14} use
this value without further incrementing
it.[¶](#section-5.8.1-11){.pilcrow}

A log where duplicate entries for the same domain have been omitted
(\"nonced duplicates\" and/or \"nonceless duplicates\") could still be
acceptable for informed decisions. A log that has had \"arbitrary\"
truncations is less acceptable, but manufacturer transparency is better
than hidden truncations.[¶](#section-5.8.1-12){.pilcrow}

A registrar that sees a version value greater than 1 indicates an
audit-log format that has been enhanced with additional information. No
information will be removed in future versions; should an incompatible
change be desired in the future, then a new HTTP endpoint will be
used.[¶](#section-5.8.1-13){.pilcrow}

This document specifies a simple log format as provided by the MASA
service to the registrar. This format could be improved by distributed
consensus technologies that integrate vouchers with technologies such as

Each time the MASA issues a voucher, it appends details of the
assignment to an internal audit-log for that device. The internal
audit-log is processed when responding to requests for details as
described in [Section 5.8](#authzLogRequest){.xref}. The contents of the
audit-log can express a variety of trust levels, and this section
explains what kind of trust a registrar can derive from the
entries.[¶](#section-5.8.3-1){.pilcrow}

While the audit-log provides a list of vouchers that were issued by the
MASA, the vouchers are issued in response to voucher-requests, and it is
the content of the voucher-requests that determines how meaningful the
audit-log entries are.[¶](#section-5.8.3-2){.pilcrow}

A registrar [SHOULD]{.bcp14} use the log information to make an informed
decision regarding the continued bootstrapping of the pledge. The exact
policy is out of scope of this document as it depends on the security
requirements within the registrar domain. Equipment that is purchased
preowned can be expected to have an extensive history. The following
discussion is provided to help explain the value of each log
element:[¶](#section-5.8.3-3){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

date:
:   The date field provides the registrar an opportunity to divide the
    log around known events such as the purchase date. Depending on the
    context known to the registrar or administrator, events before/after
    certain dates can have different levels of importance. For example,
    for equipment that is expected to be new, and thus has no history,
    it would be a surprise to find prior
    entries.[¶](#section-5.8.3-4.2){.pilcrow}
:   

domainID:
:   If the log includes an unexpected domainID, then the pledge could
    have imprinted on an unexpected domain. The registrar can be
    expected to use a variety of techniques to define \"unexpected\"
    ranging from acceptlists of prior domains to anomaly detection
    (e.g., \"this device was previously bound to a different domain than
    any other device deployed\"). Log entries can also be compared
    against local history logs in search of discrepancies (e.g., \"this
    device was re-deployed some number of times internally, but the
    external audit-log shows additional re-deployments our internal logs
    are unaware of\").[¶](#section-5.8.3-4.4){.pilcrow}
:   

nonce:
:   Nonceless entries mean the logged domainID could theoretically
    trigger a reset of the pledge and then take over management by using
    the existing nonceless voucher.[¶](#section-5.8.3-4.6){.pilcrow}
:   

assertion:
:   The assertion leaf in the voucher and audit-log indicates why the
    MASA issued the voucher. A \"verified\" entry means that the MASA
    issued the associated voucher as a result of positive verification
    of ownership. However, this entry does not indicate whether or not
    the pledge was actually deployed in the prior domain. A \"logged\"
    assertion informs the registrar that the prior vouchers were issued
    with minimal verification. A \"proximity\" assertion assures the
    registrar that the pledge was truly communicating with the prior
    domain and thus provides assurance that the prior domain really has
    deployed the pledge.[¶](#section-5.8.3-4.8){.pilcrow}
:   

A relatively simple policy is to acceptlist known (internal or external)
domainIDs and require all vouchers to have a nonce. An alternative is to
require that all nonceless vouchers be from a subset (e.g., only
internal) of domainIDs. If the policy is violated, a simple action is to
revoke any locally issued credentials for the pledge in question or to
refuse to forward the voucher. The registrar [MUST]{.bcp14} then refuse
any EST actions and [SHOULD]{.bcp14} inform a human via a log. A
registrar [MAY]{.bcp14} be configured to ignore (i.e., override the
above policy) the history of the device, but it is [RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14}
that this only be configured if hardware-assisted (i.e., Transport

The pledge [SHOULD]{.bcp14} follow the BRSKI operations with EST
enrollment operations including \"CA Certificates Request\", \"CSR
Attributes Request\", and \"Client Certificate Request\" or
\"Server-Side Key Generation\", etc. This is a relatively seamless
integration since BRSKI API calls provide an automated alternative to
the manual bootstrapping method described in
\[[RFC7030](#RFC7030){.xref}\]. As noted above, use of HTTP-persistent
connections simplifies the pledge state
machine.[¶](#section-5.9-1){.pilcrow}

Although EST allows clients to obtain multiple certificates by sending
multiple Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs), BRSKI does not support
this mechanism directly. This is because BRSKI pledges [MUST]{.bcp14}
use the CSR Attributes request (\[[RFC7030](#RFC7030){.xref}\], [Section
4.5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7030#section-4.5){.relref}). The
registrar [MUST]{.bcp14} validate the CSR against the expected
attributes. This implies that client requests will \"look the same\" and
therefore result in a single logical certificate being issued even if
the client were to make multiple requests. Registrars [MAY]{.bcp14}
contain more complex logic, but doing so is out of scope of this
specification. BRSKI does not signal any enhancement or restriction to
this capability.[¶](#section-5.9-2){.pilcrow}

This ensures that the pledge has the complete set of current CA
certificates beyond the pinned-domain-cert (see [Section
5.6.2](#PledgeAuthenticationOfProvisionalTLS){.xref} for a discussion of
the limitations inherent in having a single certificate instead of a
full CA certificate response). Although these limitations are acceptable
during initial bootstrapping, they are not appropriate for ongoing PKIX
end-entity certificate validation.[¶](#section-5.9.1-2){.pilcrow}

#### [5.9.2.](#section-5.9.2){.section-number .selfRef} [EST CSR Attributes](#name-est-csr-attributes){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-est-csr-attributes}

Automated bootstrapping occurs without local administrative
configuration of the pledge. In some deployments, it is plausible that
the pledge generates a certificate request containing only identity
information known to the pledge (essentially the X.509 IDevID
information) and ultimately receives a certificate containing
domain-specific identity information. Conceptually, the CA has complete
control over all fields issued in the end-entity certificate.
Realistically, this is operationally difficult with the current status
of PKI CA deployments, where the CSR is submitted to the CA via a number
of non-standard protocols. Even with all standardized protocols used, it
could operationally be problematic to expect that service-specific
certificate fields can be created by a CA that is likely operated by a
group that has no insight into different network services/protocols
used. For example, the CA could even be
outsourced.[¶](#section-5.9.2-1){.pilcrow}

To alleviate these operational difficulties, the pledge [MUST]{.bcp14}
request the EST \"CSR Attributes\" from the EST server, and the EST
server needs to be able to reply with the attributes necessary for use
of the certificate in its intended protocols/services. This approach
allows for minimal CA integrations, and instead, the local
infrastructure (EST server) informs the pledge of the proper fields to
include in the generated CSR (such as rfc822Name). This approach is
beneficial to automated bootstrapping in the widest number of
environments.[¶](#section-5.9.2-2){.pilcrow}

In networks using the BRSKI enrolled certificate to authenticate the
ACP, the EST CSR Attributes [MUST]{.bcp14} include the ACP domain
information fields defined in \[[RFC8994](#RFC8994){.xref}\], [Section
6.2.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8994#section-6.2.2){.relref}.[¶](#section-5.9.2-3){.pilcrow}

The registrar [MUST]{.bcp14} also confirm that the resulting CSR is
formatted as indicated before forwarding the request to a CA. If the
registrar is communicating with the CA using a protocol such as full
Certificate Management over CMS (CMC), which provides mechanisms to
override the CSR Attributes, then these mechanisms [MAY]{.bcp14} be used
even if the client ignores the guidance for the CSR
Attributes.[¶](#section-5.9.2-4){.pilcrow}

For automated bootstrapping of devices, the administrative elements that
provide bootstrapping also provide indications to the system
administrators concerning device life-cycle status. This might include
information concerning attempted bootstrapping messages seen by the
client. The MASA provides logs and the status of credential enrollment.
Since an end user is assumed per \[[RFC7030](#RFC7030){.xref}\], a final
success indication back to the server is not included. This is
insufficient for automated use cases.[¶](#section-5.9.4-1){.pilcrow}

The client [MUST]{.bcp14} send an indicator to the registrar about its
enrollment status. It does this by using an HTTP POST of a JSON
dictionary with the attributes described below to the new EST endpoint
at \"/.well-known/brski/enrollstatus\".[¶](#section-5.9.4-2){.pilcrow}

When indicating a successful enrollment, the client [SHOULD]{.bcp14}
first re-establish the EST TLS session using the newly obtained
credentials. TLS 1.3 supports doing this in-band, but TLS 1.2 does not.
The client [SHOULD]{.bcp14} therefore always close the existing TLS
connection and start a new one, using the same Join
Proxy.[¶](#section-5.9.4-3){.pilcrow}

In the case of a failed enrollment, the client [MUST]{.bcp14} send the
telemetry information over the same TLS connection that was used for the
enrollment attempt, with a Reason string indicating why the most recent
enrollment failed. (For failed attempts, the TLS connection is the most
reliable way to correlate server-side information with what the client
provides.)[¶](#section-5.9.4-4){.pilcrow}

Lower security modes chosen by the MASA service affect all device
deployments unless the lower security behavior is tied to specific
device identities. The modes described below can be applied to specific
devices via knowledge of what devices were sold. They can also be bound
to specific customers (independent of the device identity) by
authenticating the customer\'s registrar.[¶](#section-7.4-1){.pilcrow}

A MASA has the option of not including a nonce in the voucher and/or not
requiring one to be present in the voucher-request. This results in
distribution of a voucher that may never expire and, in effect, makes
the specified domain an always trusted entity to the pledge during any
subsequent bootstrapping attempts. The log information captures when a
nonceless voucher is issued so that the registrar can make appropriate
security decisions when a pledge joins the domain. Nonceless vouchers
are useful to support use cases where registrars might not be online
during actual device deployment.[¶](#section-7.4.1-1){.pilcrow}

While a nonceless voucher may include an expiry date, a typical use for
a nonceless voucher is for it to be long lived. If the device can be
trusted to have an accurate clock (the MASA will know), then a nonceless
voucher CAN be issued with a limited
lifetime.[¶](#section-7.4.1-2){.pilcrow}

A more typical case for a nonceless voucher is for use with offline
onboarding scenarios where it is not possible to pass a fresh
voucher-request to the MASA. The use of a long-lived voucher also
eliminates concern about the availability of the MASA many years in the
future. Thus, many nonceless vouchers will have no expiry
dates.[¶](#section-7.4.1-3){.pilcrow}

Thus, the long-lived nonceless voucher does not require proof that the
device is online. Issuing such a thing is only accepted when the
registrar is authenticated by the MASA and the MASA is authorized to
provide this functionality to this customer. The MASA is
[RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14} to use this functionality only in concert with an
enhanced level of ownership tracking, the details of which are out of
scope for this document.[¶](#section-7.4.1-4){.pilcrow}

If the pledge device is known to have a real-time clock that is set from
the factory, use of a voucher validity period is
[RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14}.[¶](#section-7.4.1-5){.pilcrow}

A MASA has the option of not verifying ownership before responding with
a voucher. This is expected to be a common operational model because
doing so relieves the manufacturer providing MASA services from having
to track ownership during shipping and throughout the supply chain, and
it allows for a very low overhead MASA service. A registrar uses the
audit-log information as an in-depth defense strategy to ensure that
this does not occur unexpectedly (for example, when purchasing new
equipment, the registrar would throw an error if any audit-log
information is reported). The MASA [SHOULD]{.bcp14} verify the
prior-signed-voucher-request information for pledges that support that
functionality. This provides a proof-of-proximity check that reduces the
need for ownership verification. The proof-of-proximity comes from the
assumption that the pledge and Join Proxy are on the same link-local
connection.[¶](#section-7.4.2-1){.pilcrow}

A MASA that practices TOFU for registrar identity may wish to annotate
the origin of the connection by IP address or netblock and restrict
future use of that identity from other locations. A MASA that does this
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} take care to not create nuisance situations for itself
when a customer has multiple registrars or uses outgoing IPv4-to-IPv4
NAT (NAT44) connections that change
frequently.[¶](#section-7.4.2-2){.pilcrow}

This section deals with two problems: A MASA that is no longer available
due to a failed business and a MASA that is uncooperative to a secondary
sale.[¶](#section-7.4.3-1){.pilcrow}

A manufacturer could offer a management mechanism that allows the list
of voucher verification trust anchors to be extended.
\[[YANG-KEYSTORE](#I-D.ietf-netconf-keystore){.xref}\] describes one
such interface that could be implemented using YANG. Pretty much any
configuration mechanism used today could be extended to provide the
needed additional update. A manufacturer could even decide to install
the domain CA trust anchors received during the EST \"cacerts\" step as
voucher verification anchors. Some additional signals will be needed to
clearly identify which keys have voucher validation authority from among
those signed by the domain CA. This is future
work.[¶](#section-7.4.3-2){.pilcrow}

With the above change to the list of anchors, vouchers can be issued by
an alternate MASA. This could be the previous owner (the seller) or some
other trusted third party who is mediating the sale. If it is a third
party, the seller would need to take steps to introduce the third-party
configuration to the device prior to disconnection. The third party
(e.g., a wholesaler of used equipment) could, however, use a mechanism
described in [Section 7.2](#pledgeReductions){.xref} to take control of
the device after receiving it physically. This would permit the third
party to act as the MASA for future onboarding actions. As the IDevID
certificate probably cannot be replaced, the new owner\'s registrar
would have to support an override of the MASA
URL.[¶](#section-7.4.3-3){.pilcrow}

To be useful for resale or other transfers of ownership, one of two
situations will need to occur. The simplest is that the device is not
put through any kind of factory default/reset before going through
onboarding again. Some other secure, physical signal would be needed to
initiate it. This is most suitable for redeploying a device within the
same enterprise. This would entail having previous configuration in the
system until entirely replaced by the new owner, and it represents some
level of risk.[¶](#section-7.4.3-4){.pilcrow}

For the second scenario, there would need to be two levels of factory
reset. One would take the system back entirely to manufacturer state,
including removing any added trust anchors, and the other (more commonly
used) one would just restore the configuration back to a known default
without erasing trust anchors. This weaker factory reset might leave
valuable credentials on the device, and this may be unacceptable to some
owners.[¶](#section-7.4.3-5){.pilcrow}

As a third option, the manufacturer\'s trust anchors could be entirely
overwritten with local trust anchors. A factory default would never
restore those anchors. This option comes with a lot of power but is also
a lot of responsibility: if access to the private part of the new
anchors are lost, the manufacturer may be unable to
help.[¶](#section-7.4.3-6){.pilcrow}

(\"ACP Domain, Certificate, and Network\").[¶](#section-9-1){.pilcrow}

The protocol described in this document has appeal in a number of other
non-ANIMA use cases. Such uses of the protocol will be deployed into
other environments with different tradeoffs of privacy, security,
reliability, and autonomy from manufacturers. As such, those use cases
will need to provide their own applicability statements and will need to
address unique privacy and security considerations for the environments
in which they are used.[¶](#section-9-2){.pilcrow}

The ACP that is bootstrapped by the BRSKI protocol is typically used in
medium to large Internet service provider organizations. Equivalent
enterprises that have significant Layer 3 router connectivity also will
find significant benefit, particularly if the enterprise has many sites.
(A network consisting of primarily Layer 2 is not excluded, but the
adjacencies that the ACP will create and maintain will not reflect the
topology until all devices participate in the
ACP.)[¶](#section-9-3){.pilcrow}

In the ACP, the Join Proxy is found to be proximal because communication
between the pledge and the Join Proxy is exclusively on IPv6 link-local
addresses. The proximity of the Join Proxy to the registrar is validated
by the registrar using ANI ACP IPv6 ULAs. ULAs are not routable over the
Internet, so as long as the Join Proxy is operating correctly, the
proximity assertion is satisfied. Other uses of BRSKI will need similar
analysis if they use proximity assertions.[¶](#section-9-4){.pilcrow}

As specified in the ANIMA charter, this work \"focuses on
professionally-managed networks.\" Such a network has an operator and
can do things like install, configure, and operate the registrar
function. The operator makes purchasing decisions and is aware of what
manufacturers it expects to see on its
network.[¶](#section-9-5){.pilcrow}

Such an operator is also capable of performing bootstrapping of a device
using a serial console (craft console). The zero-touch mechanism
presented in this and the ACP document \[[RFC8994](#RFC8994){.xref}\]
represents a significant efficiency: in particular, it reduces the need
to put senior experts on airplanes to configure devices in
person.[¶](#section-9-6){.pilcrow}

As the technology evolves, there is recognition that not every situation
may work out, and occasionally a human may still have to visit. Given
this, some mechanisms are presented in [Section

at least one of the one-touch mechanisms described that permit
enrollment to proceed without the availability of any manufacturer
server (such as the MASA).[¶](#section-9-7){.pilcrow}

The BRSKI protocol is going into environments where there have already
been quite a number of vendor proprietary management systems. Those are
not expected to go away quickly but rather to leverage the secure
credentials that are provisioned by BRSKI. The connectivity requirements

The MASA audit-log includes the domainID for each domain a voucher has
been issued to. This information is closely related to the actual domain
identity. A MASA may need additional defenses against Denial-of-Service
attacks ([Section 11.1](#dosmasa){.xref}), and this may involve
collecting additional (unspecified here) information. This could provide
sufficient information for the MASA service to build a detailed
understanding of the devices that have been provisioned within a
domain.[¶](#section-10.1-1){.pilcrow}

There are a number of design choices that mitigate this risk. The domain
can maintain some privacy since it has not necessarily been
authenticated and is not authoritatively bound to the supply
chain.[¶](#section-10.1-2){.pilcrow}

Additionally, the domainID captures only the unauthenticated subject key
identifier of the domain. A privacy-sensitive domain could theoretically
generate a new domainID for each device being deployed. Similarly, a
privacy-sensitive domain would likely purchase devices that support
proximity assertions from a manufacturer that does not require sales
channel integrations. This would result in a significant level of
privacy while maintaining the security characteristics provided by the
registrar-based audit-log inspection.[¶](#section-10.1-3){.pilcrow}

During the provisional phase of the BRSKI-EST connection between the
pledge and the registrar, each party reveals its certificates to each
other. For the pledge, this includes the serialNumber attribute, the
MASA URL, and the identity that signed the IDevID
certificate.[¶](#section-10.2-1){.pilcrow}

TLS 1.2 reveals the certificate identities to on-path observers,
including the Join Proxy.[¶](#section-10.2-2){.pilcrow}

TLS 1.3 reveals the certificate identities only to the end parties, but
as the connection is provisional; an on-path attacker (MITM) can see the
certificates. This includes not just malicious attackers but also
registrars that are visible to the pledge but are not part of the
intended domain.[¶](#section-10.2-3){.pilcrow}

The certificate of the registrar is rather arbitrary from the point of
view of the BRSKI protocol. As no validations
\[[RFC6125](#RFC6125){.xref}\] are expected to be done, the contents
could be easily pseudonymized. Any device that can see a Join Proxy
would be able to connect to the registrar and learn the identity of the
network in question. Even if the contents of the certificate are
pseudonymized, it would be possible to correlate different connections
in different locations that belong to the same entity. This is unlikely
to present a significant privacy concern to ANIMA ACP uses of BRSKI, but
it may be a concern to other users of
BRSKI.[¶](#section-10.2-4){.pilcrow}

The certificate of the pledge could be revealed by a malicious Join
Proxy that performed a MITM attack on the provisional TLS connection.
Such an attacker would be able to reveal the identity of the pledge to
third parties if it chose to do so.[¶](#section-10.2-5){.pilcrow}

Research into a mechanism to do multistep, multiparty authenticated key
agreement, incorporating some kind of zero-knowledge proof, would be
valuable. Such a mechanism would ideally avoid disclosing identities
until the pledge, registrar, and MASA agree to the transaction. Such a
mechanism would need to discover the location of the MASA without
knowing the identity of the pledge or the identity of the MASA. This
part of the problem may be unsolvable.[¶](#section-10.2-6){.pilcrow}

With consumer-oriented devices, the \"call-home\" mechanism in IoT
devices raises significant privacy concerns. See
\[[livingwithIoT](#livingwithIoT){.xref}\] and
\[[IoTstrangeThings](#IoTstrangeThings){.xref}\] for exemplars. The ACP
usage of BRSKI is not targeted at individual usage of IoT devices but
rather at the enterprise and ISP creation of networks in a zero-touch
fashion where the \"call-home\" represents a different class of privacy
and life-cycle management concerns.[¶](#section-10.3-1){.pilcrow}

It needs to be reiterated that the BRSKI-MASA mechanism only occurs once
during the commissioning of the device. It is well defined, and although
encrypted with TLS, it could in theory be made auditable as the contents
are well defined. This connection does not occur when the device powers
on or is restarted for normal routines. (It is conceivable, but
remarkably unusual, that a device could be forced to go through a full
factory reset during an exceptional firmware update situation, after
which enrollment would have to be repeated, and a new connection would
occur.)[¶](#section-10.3-2){.pilcrow}

The BRSKI call-home mechanism is mediated via the owner\'s registrar,
and the information that is transmitted is directly auditable by the
device owner. This is in stark contrast to many \"call-home\" protocols
where the device autonomously calls home and uses an undocumented
protocol.[¶](#section-10.3-3){.pilcrow}

While the contents of the signed part of the pledge voucher-request
cannot be changed, they are not encrypted at the registrar. The ability
to audit the messages by the owner of the network is a mechanism to
defend against exfiltration of data by a nefarious pledge. Both are, to
reiterate, encrypted by TLS while in
transit.[¶](#section-10.3-4){.pilcrow}

The BRSKI-MASA exchange reveals the following information to the
manufacturer:[¶](#section-10.3-5){.pilcrow}

-   [the identity of the device being enrolled. This is revealed by
    transmission of a signed voucher-request containing the
    serial-number. The manufacturer can usually link the serial number
    to a device
    model.[¶](#section-10.3-6.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-10.3-6.1}
-   [an identity of the domain owner in the form of the domain trust
    anchor. However, this is not a global PKI-anchored name within the
    WebPKI, so this identity could be pseudonymous. If there is sales
    channel integration, then the MASA will have authenticated the
    domain owner, via either a pinned certificate or perhaps another
    HTTP authentication method, as per [Section
    5.5.4](#MASAauthenticationOfRegistrar){.xref}.[¶](#section-10.3-6.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-10.3-6.2}
-   [the time the device is
    activated.[¶](#section-10.3-6.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-10.3-6.3}
-   [the IP address of the domain owner\'s registrar. For ISPs and
    enterprises, the IP address provides very clear geolocation of the
    owner. No amount of IP address privacy extensions
    \[[RFC8981](#RFC8981){.xref}\] can do anything about this, as a
    simple whois lookup likely identifies the ISP or enterprise from the
    upper bits anyway. A passive attacker who observes the connection
    definitely may conclude that the given enterprise/ISP is a customer
    of the particular equipment vendor. The precise model that is being
    enrolled will remain
    private.[¶](#section-10.3-6.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-10.3-6.4}

Based upon the above information, the manufacturer is able to track a
specific device from pseudonymous domain identity to the next
pseudonymous domain identity. If there is sales-channel integration,
then the identities are not pseudonymous.[¶](#section-10.3-7){.pilcrow}

The manufacturer knows the IP address of the registrar, but it cannot
see the IP address of the device itself. The manufacturer cannot track
the device to a detailed physical or network location, only to the
location of the registrar. That is likely to be at the enterprise or
ISP\'s headquarters.[¶](#section-10.3-8){.pilcrow}

The above situation is to be distinguished from a residential/individual
person who registers a device from a manufacturer. Individuals do not
tend to have multiple offices, and their registrar is likely on the same
network as the device. A manufacturer that sells switching/routing
products to enterprises should hardly be surprised if additional
purchases of switching/routing products are made. Deviations from a
historical trend or an established baseline would, however, be
notable.[¶](#section-10.3-9){.pilcrow}

The situation is not improved by the enterprise/ISP using anonymization
services such as Tor \[[Dingledine](#Dingledine){.xref}\], as a TLS 1.2
connection will reveal the ClientCertificate used, clearly identifying
the enterprise/ISP involved. TLS 1.3 is better in this regard, but an
active attacker can still discover the parties involved by performing a
MITM attack on the first attempt (breaking/killing it with a TCP reset
(RST)), and then letting subsequent connection pass
through.[¶](#section-10.3-10){.pilcrow}

A manufacturer could attempt to mix the BRSKI-MASA traffic in with
general traffic on their site by hosting the MASA behind the same (set)
of load balancers that the company\'s normal marketing site is hosted
behind. This makes a lot of sense from a straight capacity planning
point of view as the same set of services (and the same set of
Distributed Denial-of-Service mitigations) may be used. Unfortunately,
as the BRSKI-MASA connections include TLS ClientCertificate exchanges,
this may easily be observed in TLS 1.2, and a traffic analysis may
reveal it even in TLS 1.3. This does not make such a plan irrelevant.
There may be other organizational reasons to keep the marketing site
(which is often subject to frequent redesigns, outsourcing, etc.)
separate from the MASA, which may need to operate reliably for
decades.[¶](#section-10.3-11){.pilcrow}

As explained above, the manufacturer receives information each time a
device that is in factory-default mode does a zero-touch bootstrap and
attempts to enroll into a domain owner\'s

The manufacturer is therefore in a position to decline to issue a
voucher if it detects that the new owner is not the same as the previous
owner.[¶](#section-10.4-2){.pilcrow}

1.  [This can be seen as a feature if the equipment is believed to have
    been stolen. If the legitimate owner notifies the manufacturer of
    the theft, then when the new owner brings the device up, if they use
    the zero-touch mechanism, the new (illegitimate) owner reveals their
    location and

    occurs.[¶](#section-10.4-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-10.4-3.2}
3.  [A manufacturer could, however, decide not to issue a new voucher in

4.  [There is a fourth case, if the manufacturer is providing protection
    against stolen devices. The manufacturer then has a responsibility
    to protect the legitimate owner against fraudulent claims that the
    equipment was stolen. In the absence of such manufacturer
    protection, such a claim would cause the manufacturer to refuse to
    issue a new voucher. Should the device go through a deep factory
    reset (for instance, replacement of a damaged main board component),
    the device would not
    bootstrap.[¶](#section-10.4-3.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-10.4-3.4}
5.  [Finally, there is a fifth case: the manufacturer has decided to

    systems are already deployed that have a significantly worse
    effect.[¶](#section-10.4-3.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-10.4-3.5}

This section has outlined five situations in which a manufacturer could
use the voucher system to enforce what are clearly license terms. A
manufacturer that attempted to enforce license terms via vouchers would
find it rather ineffective as the terms would only be enforced when the
device is enrolled, and this is not (to repeat) a daily or even monthly
occurrence.[¶](#section-10.4-4){.pilcrow}

### [10.5.](#section-10.5){.section-number .selfRef} [Manufacturers and Grey Market Equipment](#name-manufacturers-and-grey-mark){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-manufacturers-and-grey-mark}

Manufacturers of devices often sell different products into different
regional markets. Which product is available in which market can be
driven by price differentials, support issues (some markets may require
manuals and tech support to be done in the local language), and
government export regulation (such as whether strong crypto is permitted
to be exported or permitted to be used in a particular market). When a
domain owner obtains a device from a different market (they can be new)
and transfers it to a different location, this is called a Grey
Market.[¶](#section-10.5-1){.pilcrow}

A manufacturer could decide not to issue a voucher to an enterprise/ISP
based upon their location. There are a number of ways that this could be
determined: from the geolocation of the registrar, from sales channel
knowledge about the customer, and from what products are available or
unavailable in that market. If the device has a GPS, the coordinates of
the device could even be placed into an extension of the
voucher.[¶](#section-10.5-2){.pilcrow}

The above actions are not illegal, and not new. Many manufacturers have
shipped crypto-weak (exportable) versions of firmware as the default on
equipment for decades. The first task of an enterprise/ISP has always
been to login to a manufacturer system, show one\'s \"entitlement\"
(country information, proof that support payments have been made), and
receive either a new updated firmware or a license key that will
activate the correct firmware.[¶](#section-10.5-3){.pilcrow}

BRSKI permits the above process to be automated (in an autonomic
fashion) and therefore perhaps encourages this kind of differentiation
by reducing the cost of doing it.[¶](#section-10.5-4){.pilcrow}

An issue that manufacturers will need to deal with in the above
automated process is when a device is shipped to one country with one
set of rules (or laws or entitlements), but the domain registry is in
another one. Which rules apply is something that will have to be worked
out: the manufacturer could believe they are dealing with Grey Market
equipment when they are simply dealing with a global
enterprise.[¶](#section-10.5-5){.pilcrow}

The most obvious mitigation is not to buy the product. Pick
manufacturers that are up front about their policies and who do not
change them gratuitously.[¶](#section-10.6-1){.pilcrow}

[Section 7.4.3](#masasecurityreduction_newanchor){.xref} describes some
ways in which a manufacturer could provide a mechanism to manage the
trust anchors and built-in certificates (IDevID) as an extension. There
are a variety of mechanisms, and some may take a substantial amount of
work to get exactly correct. These mechanisms do not change the flow of
the protocol described here but rather allow the starting trust
assumptions to be changed. This is an area for future standardization
work.[¶](#section-10.6-2){.pilcrow}

Replacement of the voucher validation anchors (usually pointing to the
original manufacturer\'s MASA) with those of the new owner permits the
new owner to issue vouchers to subsequent owners. This would be done by
having the selling (old) owner run a MASA.[¶](#section-10.6-3){.pilcrow}

The BRSKI protocol depends upon a trust anchor and an identity on the
device. Management of these entities facilitates a few new operational
modes without making any changes to the BRSKI protocol. Those modes
include: offline modes where the domain owner operates an internal MASA
for all devices, resell modes where the first domain owner becomes the
MASA for the next (resold-to) domain owner, and services where an
aggregator acquires a large variety of devices and then acts as a
pseudonymized MASA for a variety of devices from a variety of
manufacturers.[¶](#section-10.6-4){.pilcrow}

Although replacement of the IDevID is not required for all modes
described above, a manufacturer could support such a thing. Some may
wish to consider replacement of the IDevID as an indication that the
device\'s warranty is terminated. For others, the privacy requirements
of some deployments might consider this a standard operating
practice.[¶](#section-10.6-5){.pilcrow}

As discussed at the end of [Section 5.8.1](#MASAauditlog){.xref}, new
work could be done to use a distributed consensus technology for the
audit-log. This would permit the audit-log to continue to be useful,
even when there is a chain of MASA due to changes of
ownership.[¶](#section-10.6-6){.pilcrow}

many companies have outsourced email, advertising, and janitorial
services.[¶](#section-10.7-2){.pilcrow}

## [11.](#section-11){.section-number .selfRef} [Security Considerations](#name-security-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-security-considerations}

This document details a protocol for bootstrapping that balances
operational concerns against security concerns. As detailed in the
introduction, and touched on again in [Section
7](#reducedsecuritymodes){.xref}, the protocol allows for reduced
security modes. These attempt to deliver additional control to the local
administrator and owner in cases where less security provides
operational benefits. This section goes into more detail about a variety
of specific considerations.[¶](#section-11-1){.pilcrow}

To facilitate logging and administrative oversight, in addition to
triggering registrar verification of MASA logs, the pledge reports on
the voucher parsing status to the registrar. In the case of a failure,
this information is informative to a potentially malicious registrar.
This is mandated anyway because of the operational benefits of an
informed administrator in cases where the failure is indicative of a
problem. The registrar is [RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14} to verify MASA logs if
voucher status telemetry is not received.[¶](#section-11-2){.pilcrow}

To facilitate truly limited clients, EST requires that the client
[MUST]{.bcp14} support a client authentication model (see
\[[RFC7030](#RFC7030){.xref}\], [Section
3.3.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7030#section-3.3.2){.relref});
[Section 7](#reducedsecuritymodes){.xref} updates these requirements by
stating that the registrar [MAY]{.bcp14} choose to accept devices that
fail cryptographic authentication. This reflects current (poor)
practices in shipping devices without a cryptographic identity that are
[NOT RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14}.[¶](#section-11-3){.pilcrow}

During the provisional period of the connection, the pledge
[MUST]{.bcp14} treat all HTTP header and content data as untrusted data.
HTTP libraries are regularly exposed to non-secured HTTP traffic: mature
libraries should not have any problems.[¶](#section-11-4){.pilcrow}

Pledges might chose to engage in protocol operations with multiple
discovered registrars in parallel. As noted above, they will only do so
with distinct nonce values, but the end result could be multiple
vouchers issued from the MASA if all registrars attempt to claim the
device. This is not a failure, and the pledge chooses whichever voucher
to accept based on internal logic. The registrars verifying log
information will see multiple entries and take this into account for
their analytic purposes.[¶](#section-11-5){.pilcrow}

There are use cases where the MASA could be unavailable or uncooperative
to the registrar. They include active DoS attacks, planned and unplanned
network partitions, changes to MASA policy, or other instances where
MASA policy rejects a claim. These introduce an operational risk to the
registrar owner in that MASA behavior might limit the ability to
bootstrap a pledge device. For example, this might be an issue during
disaster recovery. This risk can be mitigated by registrars that request
and maintain long-term copies of \"nonceless\" vouchers. In that way,
they are guaranteed to be able to bootstrap their
devices.[¶](#section-11.1-1){.pilcrow}

The issuance of nonceless vouchers themselves creates a security
concern. If the registrar of a previous domain can intercept protocol
communications, then it can use a previously issued nonceless voucher to
establish management control of a pledge device even after having sold
it. This risk is mitigated by recording the issuance of such vouchers in
the MASA audit-log that is verified by the subsequent registrar and by
pledges only bootstrapping when in a factory default state. This
reflects a balance between enabling MASA independence during future
bootstrapping and the security of bootstrapping itself. Registrar
control over requesting and auditing nonceless vouchers allows device
owners to choose an appropriate balance.[¶](#section-11.1-2){.pilcrow}

The MASA is exposed to DoS attacks wherein attackers claim an unbounded
number of devices. Ensuring a registrar is representative of a valid
manufacturer customer, even without validating ownership of specific
pledge devices, helps to mitigate this. Pledge signatures on the pledge
voucher-request, as forwarded by the registrar in the
prior-signed-voucher-request field of the registrar voucher-request,
significantly reduce this risk by ensuring the MASA can confirm
proximity between the pledge and the registrar making the request.
Supply-chain integration (\"know your customer\") is an additional step
that MASA providers and device vendors can
explore.[¶](#section-11.1-3){.pilcrow}

A concern has been raised that the pledge voucher-request should contain
some content (a nonce) provided by the registrar and/or MASA in order
for those actors to verify that the pledge voucher-request is
fresh.[¶](#section-11.4-1){.pilcrow}

There are a number of operational problems with getting a nonce from the
MASA to the pledge. It is somewhat easier to collect a random value from
the registrar, but as the registrar is not yet vouched for, such a
registrar nonce has little value. There are privacy and logistical
challenges to addressing these operational issues, so if such a thing
were to be considered, it would have to provide some clear value. This
section examines the impacts of not having a fresh pledge
voucher-request.[¶](#section-11.4-2){.pilcrow}

Because the registrar authenticates the pledge, a full MITM attack is
not possible, despite the provisional TLS authentication by the pledge
(see [Section 5](#ProtocolDetails){.xref}.) Instead, we examine the case
of a fake registrar (Rm) that communicates with the pledge in parallel
or in close-time proximity with the intended registrar. (This scenario
is intentionally supported as described in [Section
4.1](#discovery){.xref}.)[¶](#section-11.4-3){.pilcrow}

The fake registrar (Rm) can obtain a voucher signed by the MASA either
directly or through arbitrary intermediaries. Assuming that the MASA
accepts the registrar voucher-request (because either the Rm is
collaborating with a legitimate registrar according to supply-chain
information or the MASA is in audit-log only mode), then a voucher
linking the pledge to the registrar Rm is
issued.[¶](#section-11.4-4){.pilcrow}

Such a voucher, when passed back to the pledge, would link the pledge to
registrar Rm and permit the pledge to end the provisional state. It now
trusts the Rm and, if it has any security vulnerabilities leverageable
by an Rm with full administrative control, can be assumed to be a threat
against the intended registrar.[¶](#section-11.4-5){.pilcrow}

This flow is mitigated by the intended registrar verifying the
audit-logs available from the MASA as described in [Section
5.8](#authzLogRequest){.xref}. The Rm might chose to collect a
voucher-request but wait until after the intended registrar completes
the authorization process before submitting it. This pledge
voucher-request would be \"stale\" in that it has a nonce that no longer
matches the internal state of the pledge. In order to successfully use
any resulting voucher, the Rm would need to remove the stale nonce or
anticipate the pledge\'s future nonce state. Reducing the possibility of
this is why the pledge is mandated to generate a strong random or
pseudo-random number nonce.[¶](#section-11.4-6){.pilcrow}

Additionally, in order to successfully use the resulting voucher, the Rm
would have to attack the pledge and return it to a bootstrapping-enabled
state. This would require wiping the pledge of current configuration and
triggering a rebootstrapping of the pledge. This is no more likely than
simply taking control of the pledge directly, but if this is a

### [11.5.](#section-11.5){.section-number .selfRef} [Trusting Manufacturers](#name-trusting-manufacturers){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-trusting-manufacturers}

The BRSKI extensions to EST permit a new pledge to be completely
configured with domain-specific trust anchors. The link from built-in
manufacturer-provided trust anchors to domain-specific trust anchors is
mediated by the signed voucher artifact.[¶](#section-11.5-1){.pilcrow}

If the manufacturer\'s IDevID signing key is not properly validated,
then there is a risk that the network will accept a pledge that should
not be a member of the network. As the address of the manufacturer\'s
MASA is provided in the IDevID using the extension from [Section
2.3](#IDevIDextension){.xref}, the malicious pledge will have no problem
collaborating with its MASA to produce a completely valid
voucher.[¶](#section-11.5-2){.pilcrow}

BRSKI does not, however, fundamentally change the trust model from
domain owner to manufacturer. Assuming that the pledge used its IDevID
with EST \[[RFC7030](#RFC7030){.xref}\] and BRSKI, the domain
(registrar) still needs to trust the
manufacturer.[¶](#section-11.5-3){.pilcrow}

Establishing this trust between domain and manufacturer is outside the
scope of BRSKI. There are a number of mechanisms that can be adopted
including:[¶](#section-11.5-4){.pilcrow}

-   [Manually configuring each manufacturer\'s trust
    anchor.[¶](#section-11.5-5.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-11.5-5.1}
-   [A TOFU mechanism. A human would be queried upon seeing a
    manufacturer\'s trust anchor for the first time, and then the trust
    anchor would be installed to the trusted store. There are risks with
    this; even if the key to name mapping is validated using something
    like the WebPKI, there remains the possibility that the name is a
    look alike: e.g., dem0.example. vs.
    demO.example.[¶](#section-11.5-5.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-11.5-5.2}
-   [scanning the trust anchor from a QR code that came with the

-   [some sales integration processing where trust anchors are provided
    as part of the sales process, probably included in a digital packing
    \"slip\", or a sales
    invoice.[¶](#section-11.5-5.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-11.5-5.4}
-   [consortium membership, where all manufacturers of a particular

The existing WebPKI provides a reasonable anchor between manufacturer

reasonable authorization for the manufacturer, so it is not directly

### [11.6.](#section-11.6){.section-number .selfRef} [Manufacturer Maintenance of Trust Anchors](#name-manufacturer-maintenance-of){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-manufacturer-maintenance-of}

BRSKI depends upon the manufacturer building in trust anchors to the
pledge device. The voucher artifact that is signed by the MASA will be
validated by the pledge using that anchor. This implies that the
manufacturer needs to maintain access to a signing key that the pledge
can validate.[¶](#section-11.6-1){.pilcrow}

The manufacturer will need to maintain the ability to make signatures
that can be validated for the lifetime that the device could be
onboarded. Whether this onboarding lifetime is less than the device
lifetime depends upon how the device is used. An inventory of devices
kept in a warehouse as spares might not be onboarded for many
decades.[¶](#section-11.6-2){.pilcrow}

There are good cryptographic hygiene reasons why a manufacturer would
not want to maintain access to a private key for many decades. A
manufacturer in that situation can leverage a long-term CA anchor,
built-in to the pledge, and then a certificate chain may be incorporated
using the normal CMS certificate set. This may increase the size of the
voucher artifacts, but that is not a significant issue in
non-constrained environments.[¶](#section-11.6-3){.pilcrow}

There are a few other operational variations that manufacturers could
consider. For instance, there is no reason that every device need have
the same set of trust anchors preinstalled. Devices built in different
factories, or on different days, or in any other consideration, could
have different trust anchors built in, and the record of which batch the
device is in would be recorded in the asset database. The manufacturer
would then know which anchor to sign an artifact
against.[¶](#section-11.6-4){.pilcrow}

Aside from the concern about long-term access to private keys, a major
limiting factor for the shelf life of many devices will be the age of
the cryptographic algorithms included. A device produced in 2019 will
have hardware and software capable of validating algorithms common in
2019 and will have no defense against attacks (both quantum and von
Neumann brute-force attacks) that have not yet been invented. This
concern is orthogonal to the concern about access to private keys, but
this concern likely dominates and limits the life span of a device in a
warehouse. If any update to the firmware to support new cryptographic
mechanisms were possible (while the device was in a warehouse), updates
to trust anchors would also be done at the same
time.[¶](#section-11.6-5){.pilcrow}

The set of standard operating procedures for maintaining high-value
private keys is well documented. For instance, the WebPKI provides a
number of options for audits in
\[[cabforumaudit](#cabforumaudit){.xref}\], and the DNSSEC root
operations are well documented in
\[[dnssecroot](#dnssecroot){.xref}\].[¶](#section-11.6-6){.pilcrow}

It is not clear if manufacturers will take this level of precaution, or
how strong the economic incentives are to maintain an appropriate level
of security.[¶](#section-11.6-7){.pilcrow}

The next section examines the risk due to a compromised manufacturer
IDevID signing key. This is followed by examination of the risk due to a
compromised MASA key. The third section below examines the situation
where a MASA web server itself is under attacker control, but the MASA
signing key itself is safe in a not-directly connected hardware
module.[¶](#section-11.6-8){.pilcrow}

An attacker that has access to the key that the manufacturer uses to
sign IDevID certificates can create counterfeit devices. Such devices
can claim to be from a particular manufacturer but can be entirely
different devices: Trojan horses in
effect.[¶](#section-11.6.1-1){.pilcrow}

As the attacker controls the MASA URL in the certificate, the registrar
can be convinced to talk to the attacker\'s MASA. The registrar does not
need to be in any kind of promiscuous mode to be
vulnerable.[¶](#section-11.6.1-2){.pilcrow}

In addition to creating fake devices, the attacker may also be able to
issue revocations for existing certificates if the IDevID certificate
process relies upon CRL lists that are
distributed.[¶](#section-11.6.1-3){.pilcrow}

There does not otherwise seem to be any risk from this compromise to
devices that are already deployed or that are sitting locally in boxes
waiting for deployment (local spares). The issue is that operators will
be unable to trust devices that have been in an uncontrolled warehouse
as they do not know if those are real
devices.[¶](#section-11.6.1-4){.pilcrow}

There are two periods of time in which to consider: when the MASA key
has fallen into the hands of an attacker and after the MASA recognizes
that the key has been compromised.[¶](#section-11.6.2-1){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-11.6.2.1 .section}
##### [11.6.2.1.](#section-11.6.2.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Attacker Opportunities with a Compromised MASA Key](#name-attacker-opportunities-with){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-attacker-opportunities-with}

An attacker that has access to the MASA signing key could create
vouchers. These vouchers could be for existing deployed devices or for
devices that are still in a warehouse. In order to exploit these
vouchers, two things need to occur: the device has to go through a
factory default boot cycle, and the registrar has to be convinced to
contact the attacker\'s MASA.[¶](#section-11.6.2.1-1){.pilcrow}

If the attacker controls a registrar that is visible to the device, then
there is no difficulty in delivery of the false voucher. A possible
practical example of an attack like this would be in a data center, at
an ISP peering point (whether a public IX or a private peering point).
In such a situation, there are already cables attached to the equipment
that lead to other devices (the peers at the IX), and through those
links, the false voucher could be delivered. The difficult part would be
to put the device through a factory reset. This might be accomplished
through social engineering of data center staff. Most locked cages have
ventilation holes, and possibly a long \"paperclip\" could reach through
to depress a factory reset button. Once such a piece of ISP equipment
has been compromised, it could be used to compromise equipment that it
was connected to (through long haul links even), assuming that those
pieces of equipment could also be forced through a factory
reset.[¶](#section-11.6.2.1-2){.pilcrow}

The above scenario seems rather unlikely as it requires some element of
physical access; but if there was a remote exploit that did not cause a
direct breach, but rather a fault that resulted in a factory reset, this
could provide a reasonable path.[¶](#section-11.6.2.1-3){.pilcrow}

The above deals with ANI uses of BRSKI. For cases where IEEE 802.11 or
802.15.4 is involved, the need to connect directly to the device is
eliminated, but the need to do a factory reset is not. Physical
possession of the device is not required as above, provided that there
is some way to force a factory reset. With some consumer devices that
have low overall implementation quality, end users might be familiar
with the need to reset the device
regularly.[¶](#section-11.6.2.1-4){.pilcrow}

The authors are unable to come up with an attack scenario where a
compromised voucher signature enables an attacker to introduce a
compromised pledge into an existing operator\'s network. This is the
case because the operator controls the communication between registrar
and MASA, and there is no opportunity to introduce the fake voucher
through that conduit.[¶](#section-11.6.2.1-5){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-11.6.2.2 .section}

Once the operator of the MASA realizes that the voucher signing key has
been compromised, it has to do a few
things.[¶](#section-11.6.2.2-1){.pilcrow}

First, it [MUST]{.bcp14} issue a firmware update to all devices that had
that key as a trust anchor, such that they will no longer trust vouchers
from that key. This will affect devices in the field that are operating,
but those devices, being in operation, are not performing onboarding
operations, so this is not a critical
patch.[¶](#section-11.6.2.2-2){.pilcrow}

Devices in boxes (in warehouses) are vulnerable and remain vulnerable
until patched. An operator would be prudent to unbox the devices,
onboard them in a safe environment, and then perform firmware updates.
This does not have to be done by the end-operator; it could be done by a
distributor that stores the spares. A recommended practice for
high-value devices (which typically have a \<4hr service window) may be
to validate the device operation on a regular basis
anyway.[¶](#section-11.6.2.2-3){.pilcrow}

If the onboarding process includes attestations about firmware versions,
then through that process, the operator would be advised to upgrade the
firmware before going into production. Unfortunately, this does not help
against situations where the attacker operates their own registrar (as
listed above).[¶](#section-11.6.2.2-4){.pilcrow}

The need for short-lived vouchers is explained in
\[[RFC8366](#RFC8366){.xref}\], [Section
6.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8366#section-6.1){.relref}. The
nonce guarantees freshness, and the short-lived nature of the voucher
means that the window to deliver a fake voucher is very short. A
nonceless, long-lived voucher would be the only option for the attacker,
and devices in the warehouse would be vulnerable to such a
thing.[¶](#section-11.6.2.2-5){.pilcrow}

A key operational recommendation is for manufacturers to sign nonceless,
long-lived vouchers with a different key than what is used to sign
short-lived vouchers. That key needs significantly better protection. If
both keys come from a common trust-anchor (the manufacturer\'s CA), then
a compromise of the manufacturer\'s CA would compromise both keys. Such
a compromise of the manufacturer\'s CA likely compromises all keys
outlined in this section.[¶](#section-11.6.2.2-6){.pilcrow}

An attacker that takes over the MASA web service can inflict a number of
attacks. The most obvious one is simply to take the database listing of
customers and devices and sell the data to other attackers who will now
know where to find potentially vulnerable
devices.[¶](#section-11.6.3-1){.pilcrow}

The second most obvious thing that the attacker can do is to kill the
service, or make it operate unreliably, making customers frustrated.
This could have a serious effect on the ability to deploy new services
by customers and would be a significant issue during disaster
recovery.[¶](#section-11.6.3-2){.pilcrow}

While the compromise of the MASA web service may lead to the compromise
of the MASA voucher signing key, if the signing occurs offboard (such as
in a hardware signing module (HSM)), then the key may well be safe, but
control over it resides with the
attacker.[¶](#section-11.6.3-3){.pilcrow}

Such an attacker can issue vouchers for any device presently in service.
Said device still needs to be convinced to go through a factory reset
process before an attack.[¶](#section-11.6.3-4){.pilcrow}

If the attacker has access to a key that is trusted for long-lived
nonceless vouchers, then they could issue vouchers for devices that are
not yet in service. This attack may be very hard to verify as it would
involve doing firmware updates on every device in warehouses (a
potentially ruinously expensive process); a manufacturer might be
reluctant to admit this possibility.[¶](#section-11.6.3-5){.pilcrow}

Instead of an IPv6 link-local address, an IPv4 address may be generated
using \"Dynamic Configuration of IPv4 Link-Local Addresses\"
\[[RFC3927](#RFC3927){.xref}\].[¶](#section-a.1-1){.pilcrow}

In the case where an IPv4 link-local address is formed, the bootstrap
process would continue, as in an IPv6 case, by looking for a (circuit)
proxy.[¶](#section-a.1-2){.pilcrow}

The pledge [MAY]{.bcp14} obtain an IP address via DHCP
(\[[RFC2131](#RFC2131){.xref}\]. The DHCP-provided parameters for the
Domain Name System can be used to perform DNS operations if all local
discovery attempts fail.[¶](#section-a.2-1){.pilcrow}

Pledge discovery of the proxy ([Section 4.1](#discovery){.xref})
[MAY]{.bcp14} be performed with DNS-based Service Discovery
\[[RFC6763](#RFC6763){.xref}\] over Multicast DNS
\[[RFC6762](#RFC6762){.xref}\] to discover the proxy at
\"\_brski-proxy.\_tcp.local.\".[¶](#section-appendix.b-1){.pilcrow}

Proxy discovery of the registrar ([Section 4.3](#JRCgrasp){.xref})
[MAY]{.bcp14} be performed with DNS-based Service Discovery over
Multicast DNS to discover registrars by searching for the service
\"\_brski-registrar.\_tcp.local.\".[¶](#section-appendix.b-2){.pilcrow}

To prevent unacceptable levels of network traffic, when using mDNS, the
congestion avoidance mechanisms specified in
\[[RFC6762](#RFC6762){.xref}\], [Section
7](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6762#section-7){.relref}
[MUST]{.bcp14} be followed. The pledge [SHOULD]{.bcp14} listen for an
unsolicited broadcast response as described in
\[[RFC6762](#RFC6762){.xref}\]. This allows devices to avoid announcing
their presence via mDNS broadcasts and instead silently join a network
by watching for periodic unsolicited broadcast
responses.[¶](#section-appendix.b-3){.pilcrow}

Discovery of the registrar [MAY]{.bcp14} also be performed with
DNS-based Service Discovery by searching for the service
\"\_brski-registrar.\_tcp.example.com\". In this case, the domain
\"example.com\" is discovered as described in
\[[RFC6763](#RFC6763){.xref}\], [Section
11](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6763#section-11){.relref}
([Appendix A.2](#IPv4dhcp){.xref} of this document suggests the use of
DHCP parameters).[¶](#section-appendix.b-4){.pilcrow}

If no local proxy or registrar service is located using the GRASP
mechanisms or the above-mentioned DNS-based Service Discovery methods,
the pledge [MAY]{.bcp14} contact a well-known manufacturer-provided
bootstrapping server by performing a DNS lookup using a well-known URI
such as \"brski-registrar.manufacturer.example.com\". The details of the
URI are manufacturer specific. Manufacturers that leverage this method
on the pledge are responsible for providing the registrar service. Also
see [Section
2.7](#cloudregistrar){.xref}.[¶](#section-appendix.b-5){.pilcrow}

The current DNS services returned during each query are maintained until
bootstrapping is completed. If bootstrapping fails and the pledge
returns to the Discovery state, it picks up where it left off and
continues attempting bootstrapping. For example, if the first Multicast
DNS \_bootstrapks.\_tcp.local response doesn\'t work, then the second
and third responses are tried. If these fail, the pledge moves on to
normal DNS-based Service Discovery.[¶](#section-appendix.b-6){.pilcrow}

## [Appendix C.](#section-appendix.c){.section-number .selfRef} [Example Vouchers](#name-example-vouchers){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-example-vouchers}

Three entities are involved in a voucher: the MASA issues (signs) it,
the registrar\'s public key is mentioned in it, and the pledge validates
it. In order to provide reproducible examples, the public and private
keys for an example MASA and registrar are listed
first.[¶](#section-appendix.c-1){.pilcrow}

The keys come from an open source reference implementation of BRSKI,
called \"Minerva\" \[[minerva](#minerva){.xref}\]. It is available on
GitHub \[[minervagithub](#minervagithub){.xref}\]. The keys presented
here are used in the unit and integration tests. The MASA code is called
\"highway\", the registrar code is called \"fountain\", and the example
client is called \"reach\".[¶](#section-appendix.c-2){.pilcrow}

The public key components of each are presented as base64 certificates
and are decoded by openssl\'s x509 utility so that the extensions can be
seen. This was version 1.1.1c of the library and utility of
\[[openssl](#openssl){.xref}\].[¶](#section-appendix.c-3){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-c.1 .section}
## [C.1.](#section-c.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Keys Involved](#name-keys-involved){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-keys-involved}

The manufacturer has a CA that signs the pledge\'s IDevID. In addition,
the Manufacturer\'s signing authority (the MASA) signs the vouchers, and
that certificate must distributed to the devices at manufacturing time
so that vouchers can be validated.[¶](#section-c.1-1){.pilcrow}
