# RFC 9116 {#rfcnum}

# A File Format to Aid in Security Vulnerability Disclosure {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

When security vulnerabilities are discovered by researchers, proper
reporting channels are often lacking. As a result, vulnerabilities may
be left unreported. This document defines a machine-parsable format
(\"security.txt\") to help organizations describe their vulnerability
disclosure practices to make it easier for researchers to report
vulnerabilities.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

Many security researchers encounter situations where they are unable to
report security vulnerabilities to organizations because there are no
reporting channels to contact the owner of a particular resource, and no
information is available about the vulnerability disclosure practices of
such owner.[¶](#section-1.1-1){.pilcrow}

As per [Section
4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2142#section-4){.relref} of
\[[RFC2142](#RFC2142){.xref}\], there is an existing convention of using
the \<SECURITY\@domain> email address for communications regarding
security issues. That convention provides only a single, email-based
channel of communication per domain and does not provide a way for
domain owners to publish information about their security disclosure
practices.[¶](#section-1.1-2){.pilcrow}

There are also contact conventions prescribed for Internet Service
Providers (ISPs) in [Section
2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3013#section-2){.relref} of
\[[RFC3013](#RFC3013){.xref}\], for Computer Security Incident Response
Teams (CSIRTs) in [Section
3.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2350#section-3.2){.relref} of
\[[RFC2350](#RFC2350){.xref}\], and for site operators in [Section
5.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2196#section-5.2){.relref} of
\[[RFC2196](#RFC2196){.xref}\]. As per \[[RFC7485](#RFC7485){.xref}\],
there is also contact information provided by Regional Internet
Registries (RIRs) and domain registries for owners of IP addresses,
Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs), and domain names. However, none of
these tackle the issue of how security researchers can locate contact
information and vulnerability disclosure practices for organizations in
order to report vulnerabilities.[¶](#section-1.1-3){.pilcrow}

In this document, we define a richer, machine-parsable, and more
extensible way for organizations to communicate information about their
security disclosure practices and ways to contact them. Other details of
vulnerability disclosure are outside the scope of this document. Readers
are encouraged to consult other documents such as
\[[ISO.29147.2018](#ISO.29147.2018){.xref}\] or
\[[CERT.CVD](#CERT.CVD){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1.1-4){.pilcrow}

As per \[[CERT.CVD](#CERT.CVD){.xref}\], \"vulnerability response\"
refers to reports of product vulnerabilities, which is related to but
distinct from reports of network intrusions and compromised websites
(\"incident response\"). The mechanism defined in this document is
intended to be used for the former (\"vulnerability response\"). If
implementors want to utilize this mechanism for incident response, they
should be aware of additional security considerations discussed in
[Section 5.1](#compromise){.xref}.[¶](#section-1.1-5){.pilcrow}

The \"security.txt\" file is intended to be complementary and not a
substitute or replacement for other public resources maintained by
organizations regarding their security disclosure
practices.[¶](#section-1.1-6){.pilcrow}

The key words \"[MUST]{.bcp14}\", \"[MUST NOT]{.bcp14}\",
\"[REQUIRED]{.bcp14}\", \"[SHALL]{.bcp14}\", \"[SHALL NOT]{.bcp14}\",

\"[RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14}\", \"[NOT RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14}\",
\"[MAY]{.bcp14}\", and \"[OPTIONAL]{.bcp14}\" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in BCP 14 \[[RFC2119](#RFC2119){.xref}\]
\[[RFC8174](#RFC8174){.xref}\] when, and only when, they appear in all
capitals, as shown here.[¶](#section-1.2-1){.pilcrow}

The term \"researcher\" corresponds to the terms \"finder\" and
\"reporter\" in \[[ISO.29147.2018](#ISO.29147.2018){.xref}\] and
\[[CERT.CVD](#CERT.CVD){.xref}\]. The term \"organization\" corresponds

::: {#section-2 .section}
## [2.](#section-2){.section-number .selfRef} [The Specification](#name-the-specification){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-the-specification}

This document defines a text file to be placed in a known location that
provides information about vulnerability disclosure practices of a
particular organization. The format of this file is machine parsable and
[MUST]{.bcp14} follow the ABNF grammar defined in [Section
4](#abnf){.xref}. This file is intended to help security researchers
when disclosing security vulnerabilities.[¶](#section-2-1){.pilcrow}

By convention, the file is named \"security.txt\". The location and
scope are described in [Section
3](#location){.xref}.[¶](#section-2-2){.pilcrow}

This text file contains multiple fields with different values. A field
contains a \"name\", which is the first part of a field all the way up
to the colon (for example: \"Contact:\") and follows the syntax defined
for \"field-name\" in [Section
3.6.8](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5322#section-3.6.8){.relref} of
\[[RFC5322](#RFC5322){.xref}\]. Field names are case insensitive (as per
[Section
2.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5234#section-2.3){.relref} of
\[[RFC5234](#RFC5234){.xref}\]). The \"value\" comes after the field
name (for example: \"mailto:security\@example.com\") and follows the
syntax defined for \"unstructured\" in [Section
3.2.5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5322#section-3.2.5){.relref} of
\[[RFC5322](#RFC5322){.xref}\]. The file [MAY]{.bcp14} also contain
blank lines.[¶](#section-2-3){.pilcrow}

A field [MUST]{.bcp14} always consist of a name and a value (for
example: \"Contact: mailto:security\@example.com\"). A \"security.txt\"
file can have an unlimited number of fields. Each field [MUST]{.bcp14}
appear on its own line. Unless otherwise specified by the field
definition, multiple values [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be chained together for a
single field. Unless otherwise indicated in a definition of a particular
field, a field [MAY]{.bcp14} appear multiple
times.[¶](#section-2-4){.pilcrow}

Implementors should be aware that some of the fields may contain URIs
using percent-encoding (as per [Section
2.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986#section-2.1){.relref} of
\[[RFC3986](#RFC3986){.xref}\]).[¶](#section-2-5){.pilcrow}

### [2.1.](#section-2.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Comments](#name-comments){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-comments}

Any line beginning with the \"#\" (%x23) symbol [MUST]{.bcp14} be
interpreted as a comment. The content of the comment may contain any
ASCII or Unicode characters in the %x21-7E and %x80-FFFFF ranges plus
the tab (%x09) and space (%x20) characters.[¶](#section-2.1-1){.pilcrow}

Every line [MUST]{.bcp14} end with either a carriage return and line

::: {#section-2.3 .section}
### [2.3.](#section-2.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Digital Signature](#name-digital-signature){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-digital-signature}

It is [RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14} that a \"security.txt\" file be digitally
signed using an OpenPGP cleartext signature as described in [Section
7](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4880#section-7){.relref} of
\[[RFC4880](#RFC4880){.xref}\]. When digital signatures are used, it is
also [RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14} that organizations use the \"Canonical\"
field (as per [Section 2.5.2](#canonical){.xref}), thus allowing the
digital signature to authenticate the location of the
file.[¶](#section-2.3-1){.pilcrow}

When it comes to verifying the key used to generate the signature, it is
always the security researcher\'s responsibility to make sure the key
being used is indeed one they trust.[¶](#section-2.3-2){.pilcrow}

::: {#extensibility}
::: {#section-2.4 .section}
### [2.4.](#section-2.4){.section-number .selfRef} [Extensibility](#name-extensibility){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-extensibility}

Like many other formats and protocols, this format may need to be
changed over time to fit the ever-changing landscape of the Internet.
Therefore, extensibility is provided via an IANA registry for fields as
defined in [Section 6.2](#registry){.xref}. Any fields registered via
that process [MUST]{.bcp14} be considered optional. To encourage
extensibility and interoperability, researchers [MUST]{.bcp14} ignore
any fields they do not explicitly support.[¶](#section-2.4-1){.pilcrow}

In general, implementors should \"be conservative in what you do, be
liberal in what you accept from others\" (as per
\[[RFC0793](#RFC0793){.xref}\]).[¶](#section-2.4-2){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-2.5.1 .section}
#### [2.5.1.](#section-2.5.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Acknowledgments](#name-acknowledgments){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-acknowledgments}

The \"Acknowledgments\" field indicates a link to a page where security
researchers are recognized for their reports. The page being referenced
should list security researchers that reported security vulnerabilities
and collaborated to remediate them. Organizations should be careful to
limit the vulnerability information being published in order to prevent
future attacks.[¶](#section-2.5.1-1){.pilcrow}

If this field indicates a web URI, then it [MUST]{.bcp14} begin with
\"https://\" (as per [Section
2.7.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7230#section-2.7.2){.relref} of
\[[RFC7230](#RFC7230){.xref}\]).[¶](#section-2.5.1-2){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-2.5.2 .section}
#### [2.5.2.](#section-2.5.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Canonical](#name-canonical){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-canonical}

The \"Canonical\" field indicates the canonical URIs where the
\"security.txt\" file is located, which is usually something like
\"https://example.com/.well-known/security.txt\". If this field
indicates a web URI, then it [MUST]{.bcp14} begin with \"https://\" (as
per [Section
2.7.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7230#section-2.7.2){.relref} of
\[[RFC7230](#RFC7230){.xref}\]).[¶](#section-2.5.2-1){.pilcrow}

While this field indicates that a \"security.txt\" retrieved from a

The \"Contact\" field indicates a method that researchers should use for
reporting security vulnerabilities such as an email address, a phone
number, and/or a web page with contact information. This field
[MUST]{.bcp14} always be present in a \"security.txt\" file. If this
field indicates a web URI, then it [MUST]{.bcp14} begin with

2.7.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7230#section-2.7.2){.relref} of
\[[RFC7230](#RFC7230){.xref}\]). Security email addresses should use the
conventions defined in [Section

3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986#section-3){.relref} of
\[[RFC3986](#RFC3986){.xref}\]. This means that \"mailto\" and \"tel\"
URI schemes must be used when specifying email addresses and telephone
numbers, as defined in \[[RFC6068](#RFC6068){.xref}\] and
\[[RFC3966](#RFC3966){.xref}\]. When the value of this field is an email
address, it is [RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14} that encryption be used (as per

When it comes to verifying the authenticity of the key, it is always the
security researcher\'s responsibility to make sure the key being
specified is indeed one they trust. Researchers must not assume that
this key is used to generate the digital signature referenced in

\[[RFC7231](#RFC7231){.xref}\]) to the \"security.txt\" file under the
\"/.well-known/\" path. If a \"security.txt\" file is present in both
locations, the one in the \"/.well-known/\" path [MUST]{.bcp14} be
used.[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

The file [MUST]{.bcp14} be accessed via HTTP 1.0 or a higher version,
and the file access [MUST]{.bcp14} use the \"https\" scheme (as per
[Section
2.7.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7230#section-2.7.2){.relref} of

Because of the use of URIs and well-known resources, security
considerations of \[[RFC3986](#RFC3986){.xref}\] and
\[[RFC8615](#RFC8615){.xref}\] apply here, in addition to the
considerations outlined below.[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

### [5.1.](#section-5.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Compromised Files and Incident Response](#name-compromised-files-and-incid){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-compromised-files-and-incid}

An attacker that has compromised a website is able to compromise the
\"security.txt\" file as well or set up a redirect to their own site.
This can result in security reports not being received by the
organization or being sent to the attacker.[¶](#section-5.1-1){.pilcrow}

To protect against this, organizations should use the \"Canonical\"
field to indicate the locations of the file (as per [Section
2.5.2](#canonical){.xref}), digitally sign their \"security.txt\" files
(as per [Section 2.3](#signature){.xref}), and regularly monitor the
file and the referenced resources to detect
tampering.[¶](#section-5.1-2){.pilcrow}

Security researchers should validate the \"security.txt\" file,
including verifying the digital signature and checking any available
historical records before using the information contained in the file.
If the \"security.txt\" file looks suspicious or compromised, it should
not be used.[¶](#section-5.1-3){.pilcrow}

While it is not recommended, implementors may choose to use the
information published within a \"security.txt\" file for an incident
response. In such cases, extreme caution should be taken before trusting
such information, since it may have been compromised by an attacker.
Researchers should use additional methods to verify such data including
out-of-band verification of the Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) signature,
DNSSEC-based approaches, etc.[¶](#section-5.1-4){.pilcrow}

:::

::: {#redirects}
::: {#section-5.2 .section}
### [5.2.](#section-5.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Redirects](#name-redirects){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-redirects}

When retrieving the file and any resources referenced in the file,
researchers should record any redirects since they can lead to a
different domain or IP address controlled by an attacker. Further
inspection of such redirects is recommended before using the information
contained within the file.[¶](#section-5.2-1){.pilcrow}

### [5.3.](#section-5.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Incorrect or Stale Information](#name-incorrect-or-stale-informat){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-incorrect-or-stale-informat}

If information and resources referenced in a \"security.txt\" file are
incorrect or not kept up to date, this can result in security reports
not being received by the organization or sent to incorrect contacts,
thus exposing possible security issues to third parties. Not having a
\"security.txt\" file may be preferable to having stale information in
this file. Organizations must use the \"Expires\" field (see [Section
2.5.5](#expires){.xref}) to indicate to researchers when the data in the
file is no longer valid.[¶](#section-5.3-1){.pilcrow}

Organizations should ensure that information in this file and any
referenced resources such as web pages, email addresses, and telephone
numbers are kept current, are accessible, are controlled by the
organization, and are kept secure.[¶](#section-5.3-2){.pilcrow}

### [5.4.](#section-5.4){.section-number .selfRef} [Intentionally Malformed Files, Resources, and Reports](#name-intentionally-malformed-fil){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-intentionally-malformed-fil}

It is possible for compromised or malicious sites to create files that
are extraordinarily large or otherwise malformed in an attempt to
discover or exploit weaknesses in the parsing code. Researchers should
make sure that any such code is robust against large or malformed files
and fields, and they may choose to have the code not parse files larger
than 32 KBs, those with fields longer than 2,048 characters, or those
containing more than 1,000 lines. The ABNF grammar (as defined in
[Section 4](#abnf){.xref}) can also be used as a way to verify these
files.[¶](#section-5.4-1){.pilcrow}

The same concerns apply to any other resources referenced within
\"security.txt\" files, as well as any security reports received as a
result of publishing this file. Such resources and reports may be
hostile, malformed, or malicious.[¶](#section-5.4-2){.pilcrow}

The presence of a \"security.txt\" file might be interpreted by
researchers as providing permission to do security testing against the
domain or IP address where it is published or against products and
services provided by the organization publishing the file. This might
result in increased testing against an organization by researchers. On
the other hand, a decision not to publish a \"security.txt\" file might
be interpreted by the organization operating that website to be a way to
signal to researchers that permission to test that particular site or
project is denied. This might result in pushback against researchers
reporting security issues to that
organization.[¶](#section-5.5-1){.pilcrow}

Therefore, researchers shouldn\'t assume that the presence or absence of
a \"security.txt\" file grants or denies permission for security
testing. Any such permission may be indicated in the company\'s
vulnerability disclosure policy (as per [Section 2.5.7](#policy){.xref})
or a new field (as per [Section
2.4](#extensibility){.xref}).[¶](#section-5.5-2){.pilcrow}

In multi-user / multi-tenant environments, it may be possible for a user
to take over the location of the \"security.txt\" file. Organizations
should reserve the \"security.txt\" namespace at the root to ensure no
third party can create a page with the \"security.txt\" AND
\"/.well-known/security.txt\" names.[¶](#section-5.6-1){.pilcrow}

### [5.7.](#section-5.7){.section-number .selfRef} [Protecting Data in Transit](#name-protecting-data-in-transit){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-protecting-data-in-transit}

To protect a \"security.txt\" file from being tampered with in transit,
implementors [MUST]{.bcp14} use HTTPS (as per [Section
2.7.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7230#section-2.7.2){.relref} of
\[[RFC7230](#RFC7230){.xref}\]) when serving the file itself and for
retrieval of any web URIs referenced in it (except when otherwise noted
in this specification). As part of the TLS handshake, researchers should
validate the provided X.509 certificate in accordance with
\[[RFC6125](#RFC6125){.xref}\] and the following
considerations:[¶](#section-5.7-1){.pilcrow}

-   [Matching is performed only against the DNS-ID
    identifiers.[¶](#section-5.7-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.7-2.1}
-   [DNS domain names in server certificates [MAY]{.bcp14} contain the
    wildcard character \'\*\' as the complete leftmost label within the
    identifier.[¶](#section-5.7-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.7-2.2}

The certificate may also be checked for revocation via the Online
Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) \[[RFC6960](#RFC6960){.xref}\],
certificate revocation lists (CRLs), or similar
mechanisms.[¶](#section-5.7-3){.pilcrow}

In cases where the \"security.txt\" file cannot be served via HTTPS
(such as localhost) or is being served with an invalid certificate,
additional human validation is recommended since the contents may have
been modified while in transit.[¶](#section-5.7-4){.pilcrow}

As an additional layer of protection, it is also recommended that
organizations digitally sign their \"security.txt\" file with OpenPGP
(as per [Section 2.3](#signature){.xref}). Also, to protect security
reports from being tampered with or observed while in transit,
organizations should specify encryption keys (as per [Section
2.5.4](#encryption){.xref}) unless HTTPS is being used for report
submission.[¶](#section-5.7-5){.pilcrow}

However, the determination of validity of such keys is out of scope for
this specification. Security researchers need to establish other secure
means to verify them.[¶](#section-5.7-6){.pilcrow}

### [5.8.](#section-5.8){.section-number .selfRef} [Spam and Spurious Reports](#name-spam-and-spurious-reports){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-spam-and-spurious-reports}

Similar to concerns in \[[RFC2142](#RFC2142){.xref}\], denial-of-service
attacks via spam reports would become easier once a \"security.txt\"
file is published by an organization. In addition, there is an increased
likelihood of reports being sent in an automated fashion and/or as a
result of automated scans without human analysis. Attackers can also use
this file as a way to spam unrelated third parties by listing their
resources and/or contact information.[¶](#section-5.8-1){.pilcrow}

Organizations need to weigh the advantages of publishing this file
versus the possible disadvantages and increased resources required to
analyze security reports.[¶](#section-5.8-2){.pilcrow}

Security researchers should review all information within the
\"security.txt\" file before submitting reports in an automated fashion
or reports resulting from automated scans.[¶](#section-5.8-3){.pilcrow}
