# Uniform Resource Names for Device Identifiers {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

This document describes a new Uniform Resource Name (URN) namespace for
hardware device identifiers. A general representation of device identity
can be useful in many applications, such as in sensor data streams and
storage or in equipment inventories. A URN-based representation can be
passed along in applications that need the
information.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

This document describes a new Uniform Resource Name (URN)
\[[RFC8141](#RFC8141){.xref}\] namespace for hardware device
identifiers. A general representation of device identity can be useful
in many applications, such as in sensor data streams and storage or in
equipment inventories \[[RFC7252](#RFC7252){.xref}\]
\[[RFC8428](#RFC8428){.xref}\]
\[[CoRE-RD](#I-D.ietf-core-resource-directory){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

A URN-based representation can be passed along in applications that need
the information. It fits particularly well for protocols mechanisms that
are designed to carry URNs \[[RFC7230](#RFC7230){.xref}\]
\[[RFC7540](#RFC7540){.xref}\] \[[RFC3261](#RFC3261){.xref}\]
\[[RFC7252](#RFC7252){.xref}\]. Finally, URNs can also be easily carried
and stored in formats such as XML
\[[W3C.REC-xml-19980210](#W3C.REC-xml-19980210){.xref}\], JSON
\[[RFC8259](#RFC8259){.xref}\], or SenML \[[RFC8428](#RFC8428){.xref}\].
Using URNs in these formats is often preferable as they are universally
recognized and self-describing and therefore avoid the need to agree to
interpret an octet string as a specific form of a Media Access Control
(MAC) address, for instance. Passing URNs may consume additional bytes
compared to, for instance, passing 4-byte binary IPv4 addresses, but the
former offers some flexibility in return.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

This document defines identifier URN types for situations where no such
convenient type already exists. For instance,
\[[RFC6920](#RFC6920){.xref}\] defines cryptographic identifiers,
\[[RFC7254](#RFC7254){.xref}\] defines International Mobile station
Equipment Identity (IMEI) identifiers for use with 3GPP cellular
systems, and \[[RFC8464](#RFC8464){.xref}\] defines Mobile Equipment
Identity (MEID) identifiers for use with 3GPP2 cellular systems. Those
URN types should be employed when such identifiers are transported; this
document does not redefine these identifiers in any
way.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) URNs \[[RFC4122](#RFC4122){.xref}\]
are another alternative way to represent device identifiers and already
support MAC addresses as one type of identifier. However, UUIDs can be
inconvenient in environments where it is important that the identifiers
be as simple as possible and where additional requirements on stable
storage, real-time clocks, and identifier length can be prohibitive.
Often, UUID-based identifiers are preferred for general purpose uses
instead of the MAC-based device URNs defined in this document. The
device URNs are recommended for constrained
environments.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

Future device identifier types can extend the device URN type defined in
this document (see [Section 7](#iana){.xref}), or they can define their
own URNs.[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}

Note that long-term stable unique identifiers are problematic for
privacy reasons and should be used with care as described in
\[[RFC7721](#RFC7721){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-6){.pilcrow}

The rest of this document is organized as follows. [Section
3](#devurn){.xref} defines the \"DEV\" URN type, and [Section
4](#subtypes){.xref} defines subtypes for IEEE MAC-48, EUI-48 and EUI-64
addresses, and 1-Wire device identifiers. [Section 5](#ex){.xref} gives
examples. [Section 6](#sec){.xref} discusses the security and privacy
considerations of the new URN type. Finally, [Section 7](#iana){.xref}
specifies the IANA registration for the new URN type and sets
requirements for subtype allocations within this
type.[¶](#section-1-7){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-3.1 .section}
### [3.1.](#section-3.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Purpose](#name-purpose){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-purpose}

The DEV URNs identify devices with device-specific identifiers such as
network card hardware addresses. DEV URNs are scoped to be globally
applicable (see \[[RFC8141](#RFC8141){.xref}\], [Section
6.4.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8141#section-6.4.1){.relref})
and, in general, enable systems to use these identifiers from multiple
sources in an interoperable manner. Note that in some deployments,
ensuring uniqueness requires care if manual or local assignment
mechanisms are used, as discussed in [Section
3.3](#assignment){.xref}.[¶](#section-3.1-1){.pilcrow}

Some typical DEV URN applications include equipment inventories and
smart object systems.[¶](#section-3.1-2){.pilcrow}

DEV URNs can be used in various ways in applications, software systems,
and network components, in tasks ranging from discovery (for instance,
when discovering 1-Wire network devices or detecting MAC-addressable
devices on a LAN) to intrusion detection systems and simple catalogues
of system information.[¶](#section-3.1-3){.pilcrow}

While it is possible to implement resolution systems for specific
applications or network locations, DEV URNs are typically not used in a
way that requires resolution beyond direct observation of the relevant
identifier fields in local link communication. However, it is often
useful to be able to pass device identifier information in generic URN
fields in databases or protocol fields, which makes the use of URNs for
this purpose convenient.[¶](#section-3.1-4){.pilcrow}

The DEV URN namespace complements existing namespaces such as those
involving IMEI or UUID identifiers. DEV URNs are expected to be a part
of the IETF-provided basic URN types, covering identifiers that have
previously not been possible to use in
URNs.[¶](#section-3.1-5){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-3.2 .section}
### [3.2.](#section-3.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Syntax](#name-syntax){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-syntax}

The identifier is expressed in ASCII characters and has a hierarchical
structure as follows:[¶](#section-3.2-1){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-3.2-2}
``` {.sourcecode .lang-abnf}
devurn = "urn:dev:" body componentpart
body = macbody / owbody / orgbody / osbody / opsbody / otherbody

owbody = %s"ow:" hexstring
orgbody = %s"org:" posnumber "-" identifier *( ":" identifier )
osbody = %s"os:" posnumber "-" serial *( ":" identifier )
opsbody = %s"ops:" posnumber "-" product "-" serial
          *( ":" identifier )
otherbody = subtype ":" identifier *( ":" identifier )
subtype = LALPHA *(DIGIT / LALPHA)
identifier = 1*devunreserved
identifiernodash = 1*devunreservednodash
product = identifiernodash
serial = identifier
componentpart = *( "_" identifier )
devunreservednodash = ALPHA / DIGIT / "."
devunreserved = devunreservednodash / "-"
hexstring = 1*(hexdigit hexdigit)
hexdigit = DIGIT / "a" / "b" / "c" / "d" / "e" / "f"
posnumber = NZDIGIT *DIGIT
ALPHA =  %x41-5A / %x61-7A
LALPHA =  %x41-5A
NZDIGIT = %x31-39
DIGIT =  %x30-39
```

[¶](#section-3.2-2){.pilcrow}
:::

The above syntax is represented in Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) as
defined in \[[RFC5234](#RFC5234){.xref}\] and
\[[RFC7405](#RFC7405){.xref}\]. The syntax also copies the DIGIT and
ALPHA rules originally defined in \[[RFC5234](#RFC5234){.xref}\],
exactly as defined there.[¶](#section-3.2-3){.pilcrow}

The device identifier namespace includes five subtypes (see [Section
4](#subtypes){.xref}), and more may be defined in the future as
specified in [Section 7](#iana){.xref}.[¶](#section-3.2-4){.pilcrow}

The optional underscore-separated components at the end of the DEV URN
depict individual aspects of a device. The specific strings and their
semantics are up to the designers of the device but could be used to
refer to specific interfaces or functions within the
device.[¶](#section-3.2-5){.pilcrow}

With the exception of the MAC address and 1-Wire DEV URNs, each DEV URN
may also contain optional colon-separated identifiers. These are
provided for extensibility.[¶](#section-3.2-6){.pilcrow}

There are no special character encoding rules or considerations for
conforming with the URN syntax beyond those applicable for URNs in
general \[[RFC8141](#RFC8141){.xref}\] or the context where these URNs
are carried (e.g., inside JSON \[[RFC8259](#RFC8259){.xref}\] or SenML
\[[RFC8428](#RFC8428){.xref}\]). Due to the SenML rules in
\[[RFC8428](#RFC8428){.xref}\], [Section
4.5.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8428#section-4.5.1){.relref},
it is not desirable to use percent-encoding in DEV URNs, and the
subtypes defined in this specification do not really benefit from
percent-encoding. However, this specification does not deviate from the
general syntax of URNs or their processing and normalization rules as
specified in \[[RFC3986](#RFC3986){.xref}\] and
\[[RFC8141](#RFC8141){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3.2-7){.pilcrow}

DEV URNs do not use r-, q-, or f-components as defined in
\[[RFC8141](#RFC8141){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3.2-8){.pilcrow}

Specific subtypes of DEV URNs may be validated through mechanisms
discussed in [Section 4](#subtypes){.xref}.[¶](#section-3.2-9){.pilcrow}

The string representation of the device identifier URN is fully
compatible with the URN syntax.[¶](#section-3.2-10){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-3.2.1 .section}
#### [3.2.1.](#section-3.2.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Character Case and URN-Equivalence](#name-character-case-and-urn-equi){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-character-case-and-urn-equi}

The DEV URN syntax allows both uppercase and lowercase characters. The
URN-equivalence of the DEV URNs is defined per
\[[RFC8141](#RFC8141){.xref}\], [Section
3.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8141#section-3.1){.relref}, i.e.,
two URNs are URN-equivalent if their assigned-name portions are
octet-by-octet equal after applying case normalization to the URI scheme
(\"urn\") and namespace identifier (\"dev\"). The rest of the DEV URN is
compared in a case-sensitive manner. It should be noted that
URN-equivalence matching merely quickly shows that two URNs are
definitely the same for the purposes of caching and other similar uses.
Two DEV URNs may still refer to the same entity and may not be found to
be URN-equivalent according to the \[[RFC8141](#RFC8141){.xref}\]
definition. For instance, in ABNF, strings are case insensitive (see
\[[RFC5234](#RFC5234){.xref}\], [Section
2.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5234#section-2.3){.relref}), and
a MAC address could be represented either with uppercase or lowercase
hexadecimal digits.[¶](#section-3.2.1-1){.pilcrow}

Character case is not otherwise significant for the DEV URN subtypes
defined in this document. However, future subtypes might include
identifiers that use encodings such as base64, which encodes strings in
a larger variety of characters and might even encode binary
data.[¶](#section-3.2.1-2){.pilcrow}

To facilitate equivalence checks, it is [RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14} that
implementations always use lowercase letters where they have a choice in
case, unless there is a reason otherwise. (Such a reason might be, for
instance, the use of a subtype that requires the use of both uppercase
and lowercase letters.)[¶](#section-3.2.1-3){.pilcrow}

### [3.3.](#section-3.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Assignment](#name-assignment){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-assignment}

The process for identifier assignment is dependent on the used subtype
and is documented in the specific subsection under [Section
4](#subtypes){.xref}.[¶](#section-3.3-1){.pilcrow}

Device identifiers are generally expected to identify a unique device,
barring the accidental issue of multiple devices with the same
identifiers. In many cases, device identifiers can also be changed by
users or are sometimes assigned in an algorithmic or local fashion. Any
potential conflicts arising from such assignments are not something that
the DEV URNs as such manage; they simply are there to refer to a
particular identifier. And, of course, a single device may (and often
does) have multiple identifiers, e.g., identifiers associated with
different link technologies it supports.[¶](#section-3.3-2){.pilcrow}

The DEV URN type [SHOULD]{.bcp14} only be used for hardware-based
identifiers that are expected to be persistent (with some limits, as
discussed above).[¶](#section-3.3-3){.pilcrow}

As discussed in [Section 6](#sec){.xref}, care must be taken in the use
of device-identifier-based identifiers due to their nature as long-term
identifiers that are not normally changeable. Leakage of these
identifiers outside systems where their use is justified should be
controlled.[¶](#section-3.4-1){.pilcrow}

### [4.1.](#section-4.1){.section-number .selfRef} [MAC Addresses](#name-mac-addresses){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-mac-addresses}

DEV URNs of the \"mac\" subtype are based on the EUI-64 identifier
\[[IEEE.EUI64](#IEEE.EUI64){.xref}\] derived from a device with a
built-in 64-bit EUI-64. The EUI-64 is formed from 24 or 36 bits of
organization identifier followed by 40 or 28 bits of device-specific
extension identifier assigned by that
organization.[¶](#section-4.1-1){.pilcrow}

In the DEV URN \"mac\" subtype, the hexstring is simply the full EUI-64
identifier represented as a hexadecimal string. It is always exactly 16
characters long.[¶](#section-4.1-2){.pilcrow}

MAC-48 and EUI-48 identifiers are also supported by the same DEV URN
subtype. To convert a MAC-48 address to an EUI-64 identifier, the
Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI) of the MAC-48 address (the
first three octets) becomes the organization identifier of the EUI-64
(the first three octets). The fourth and fifth octets of the EUI are set
to the fixed value 0xffff (hexadecimal). The last three octets of the
MAC-48 address become the last three octets of the EUI-64. The same
process is used to convert an EUI-48 identifier, but the fixed value
0xfffe is used instead.[¶](#section-4.1-3){.pilcrow}

Identifier assignment for all of these identifiers rests within the IEEE
Registration Authority.[¶](#section-4.1-4){.pilcrow}

Note that where randomized MAC addresses are used, the resulting DEV
URNs cannot be expected to have uniqueness, as discussed in [Section
3.3](#assignment){.xref}.[¶](#section-4.1-5){.pilcrow}

The 1-Wire system is a device communications bus system designed by
Dallas Semiconductor Corporation. (1-Wire is a registered trademark.)
1-Wire devices are identified by a 64-bit identifier that consists of an
8-bit family code, a 48-bit identifier unique within a family, and an
8-bit Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) code
\[[OW](#OW){.xref}\].[¶](#section-4.2-1){.pilcrow}

In DEV URNs with the \"ow\" subtype, the hexstring is a representation
of the full 64-bit identifier as a hexadecimal string. It is always
exactly 16 characters long. Note that the last two characters represent
the 8-bit CRC code. Implementations [MAY]{.bcp14} check the validity of
this code.[¶](#section-4.2-2){.pilcrow}

Family code and identifier assignment for all 1-Wire devices rests with
the manufacturers.[¶](#section-4.2-3){.pilcrow}

Device identifiers that have only a meaning within an organization can
also be used to represent vendor-specific or experimental identifiers or
identifiers designed for use within the context of an
organization.[¶](#section-4.3-1){.pilcrow}

Organizations are identified by their Private Enterprise Number (PEN)
\[[RFC2578](#RFC2578){.xref}\]. These numbers can be obtained from IANA.
Current PEN assignments can be viewed at
\<<https://www.iana.org/assignments/enterprise-numbers/>\>, and new

The \"os\" subtype specifies an organization and serial number.
Organizations are identified by their PEN. As with the
organization-defined identifiers ([Section 4.3](#org){.xref}), PEN
number assignments are maintained by IANA, and assignments for new
organizations can be made easily.[¶](#section-4.4-1){.pilcrow}

Historical note: The \"os\" subtype was originally defined in the Open
Mobile Alliance \"Lightweight Machine to Machine\" standard
\[[LwM2M](#LwM2M){.xref}\] but has been incorporated here to collect all
syntaxes associated with DEV URNs in one place. At the same time, the
syntax of this subtype was changed to avoid the possibility of
characters that are not allowed in the SenML Name field (see
\[[RFC8428](#RFC8428){.xref}\], [Section
4.5.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8428#section-4.5.1){.relref}).[¶](#section-4.4-2.1){.pilcrow}

Organization serial number DEV URNs consist of the PEN number and the
serial number. As with other DEV URNs, for carrying additional
information and extensibility, optional colon-separated identifiers and
underscore-separated components may also be included. The serial numbers
themselves are defined by the organization, and this specification does
not specify how they are allocated.[¶](#section-4.4-3){.pilcrow}

Organizations are also encouraged to select serial number formats that
avoid the possibility of ambiguity in the form of leading zeroes or
otherwise.[¶](#section-4.4-4){.pilcrow}

The DEV URN \"ops\" subtype was originally defined in the LwM2M standard
but has been incorporated here to collect all syntaxes associated with
DEV URNs in one place. The \"ops\" subtype specifies an organization,
product class, and a serial number. Organizations are identified by

On most devices, the user can display device identifiers. Depending on
circumstances, device identifiers may or may not be modified or tampered
with by the user. An implementation of the DEV URN [MUST]{.bcp14}
preserve such limitations and behaviors associated with the device
identifiers. In particular, a device identifier that is intended to be
immutable should not become mutable as a part of implementing the DEV
URN type. More generally, nothing in this document should be construed
to override what the relevant device specifications have already said
about the identifiers.[¶](#section-6-1){.pilcrow}

### [6.1.](#section-6.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Privacy](#name-privacy){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-privacy}

Other devices in the same network may or may not be able to identify the
device. For instance, on an Ethernet network, the MAC address of a
device is visible to all other devices.[¶](#section-6.1-1){.pilcrow}

DEV URNs often represent long-term stable unique identifiers for
devices. Such identifiers may have privacy and security implications
because they may enable correlating information about a specific device
over a long period of time, location tracking, and device-specific
vulnerability exploitation \[[RFC7721](#RFC7721){.xref}\]. Also, in some
systems, there is no easy way to change the identifier. Therefore, these
identifiers need to be used with care, and special care should be taken
to avoid leaking identifiers outside of the system that is intended to
use them.[¶](#section-6.1-2){.pilcrow}

::: {#valid}

### [6.2.](#section-6.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Validity](#name-validity){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-validity}

Information about identifiers may have significant effects in some
applications. For instance, in many sensor systems, the identifier
information is used for deciding how to use the data carried in a
measurement report. In some other systems, identifiers may be used in
policy decisions.[¶](#section-6.2-1){.pilcrow}

It is important that systems be designed to take into account the
possibility of devices reporting incorrect identifiers (either
accidentally or maliciously) and the manipulation of identifiers in
communications by illegitimate entities. Integrity protection of
communications or data objects, the use of trusted devices, and various
management practices can help address these
issues.[¶](#section-6.2-2){.pilcrow}

Similar to the advice in \[[RFC4122](#RFC4122){.xref}\], [Section
6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4122#section-6){.relref}: Do not
assume that DEV URNs are hard to guess.[¶](#section-6.2-3){.pilcrow}

Per this document, IANA has registered a new URN namespace for \"dev\",
as described in [Section 3](#devurn){.xref}.[¶](#section-7-1){.pilcrow}

IANA has created a \"DEV URN Subtypes\" registry under \"Device

follows:[¶](#section-7-2){.pilcrow}

  Subtype   Description                               Reference

  : [Table 2](#table-2){.selfRef}

Additional subtypes for DEV URNs can be defined through Specification
Required or IESG Approval \[[RFC8126](#RFC8126){.xref}\]. These
allocations are appropriate when there is a new namespace of some type
of device identifier that is defined in a stable fashion and has a
publicly available specification.[¶](#section-7-4){.pilcrow}

Note that the organization ([Section 4.3](#org){.xref}) device
identifiers can also be used in some cases, at least as a temporary
measure. It is preferable, however, that long-term usage of a broadly
employed device identifier be registered with IETF rather than used
through the organization device identifier
type.[¶](#section-7-5){.pilcrow}
