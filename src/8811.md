Signaling the need for help to defend against an active distributed
denial-of-service (DDoS) attack requires a common understanding of
mechanisms and roles among the parties coordinating a defensive
response. The signaling layer and supplementary messaging are the focus
of DDoS Open Threat Signaling (DOTS). DOTS defines a method of
coordinating defensive measures among willing peers to mitigate attacks
quickly and efficiently, enabling hybrid attack responses coordinated
locally at or near the target of an active attack, or anywhere in path
between attack sources and target. Sample DOTS use cases are elaborated
in
\[[DOTS-USE-CASES](#I-D.ietf-dots-use-cases){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

This document describes an architecture used in establishing,
maintaining, or terminating a DOTS relationship within a domain or
between domains.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

### [1.2.](#section-1.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Scope](#name-scope){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-scope}

In this architecture, DOTS clients and servers communicate using DOTS
signal channel \[[RFC8782](#RFC8782){.xref}\] and data channel
\[[RFC8783](#RFC8783){.xref}\] protocols.[¶](#section-1.2-1){.pilcrow}

The DOTS architecture presented here is applicable across network
administrative domains, for example, between an enterprise domain and
the domain of a third-party attack mitigation service, as well as to a
single administrative domain. DOTS is generally assumed to be most
effective when aiding coordination of attack response between two or
more participating networks, but single domain scenarios are valuable in
their own right, as when aggregating intra-domain DOTS client signals
for an inter-domain coordinated attack
response.[¶](#section-1.2-2){.pilcrow}

This document does not address any administrative or business agreements
that may be established between involved DOTS parties. Those
considerations are out of scope. Regardless, this document assumes
necessary authentication and authorization mechanisms are put in place
so that only authorized clients can invoke the DOTS
service.[¶](#section-1.2-3){.pilcrow}

A detailed set of DOTS requirements are discussed in
\[[RFC8612](#RFC8612){.xref}\], and the DOTS architecture is designed to
follow those requirements. Only new behavioral requirements are
described in this document.[¶](#section-1.2-4){.pilcrow}

::: {#assumptions}
::: {#section-1.3 .section}
### [1.3.](#section-1.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Assumptions](#name-assumptions){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-assumptions}

This document makes the following
assumptions:[¶](#section-1.3-1){.pilcrow}

-   [All domains in which DOTS is deployed are assumed to offer the
    required connectivity between DOTS agents and any intermediary
    network elements, but the architecture imposes no additional
    limitations on the form of
    connectivity.[¶](#section-1.3-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-1.3-2.1}
-   [Congestion and resource exhaustion are intended outcomes of a DDoS
    attack \[[RFC4732](#RFC4732){.xref}\]. Some operators may utilize
    non-impacted paths or networks for DOTS. However, in general,
    conditions should be assumed to be hostile, and DOTS must be able to
    function in all circumstances, including when the signaling path is
    significantly impaired. Congestion control requirements are
    discussed in [Section
    3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8612#section-3){.relref} of
    \[[RFC8612](#RFC8612){.xref}\]. The DOTS signal channel defined in
    \[[RFC8782](#RFC8782){.xref}\] is designed to be extremely resilient
    under extremely hostile network conditions, and it provides
    continued contact between DOTS agents even as DDoS attack traffic
    saturates the
    link.[¶](#section-1.3-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-1.3-2.2}
-   [There is no universal DDoS attack scale threshold triggering a
    coordinated response across administrative domains. A network domain
    administrator or service or application owner may arbitrarily set
    attack scale threshold triggers, or manually send requests for
    mitigation.[¶](#section-1.3-2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-1.3-2.3}
-   [Mitigation requests may be sent to one or more upstream DOTS
    servers based on criteria determined by DOTS client administrators
    and the underlying network configuration. The number of DOTS servers
    with which a given DOTS client has established communications is
    determined by local policy and is deployment specific. For example,
    a DOTS client of a multihomed network may support built-in policies
    to establish DOTS relationships with DOTS servers located upstream
    of each interconnection
    link.[¶](#section-1.3-2.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-1.3-2.4}
-   [The mitigation capacity and/or capability of domains receiving
    requests for coordinated attack response is opaque to the domains
    sending the request. The domain receiving the DOTS client signal may
    or may not have sufficient capacity or capability to filter any or
    all DDoS attack traffic directed at a target. In either case, the
    upstream DOTS server may redirect a request to another DOTS server.
    Redirection may be local to the redirecting DOTS server\'s domain or
    may involve a third-party
    domain.[¶](#section-1.3-2.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-1.3-2.5}
-   [DOTS client and server signals, as well as messages sent through
    the data channel, are sent across any transit networks with the same
    probability of delivery as any other traffic between the DOTS client
    domain and the DOTS server domain. Any encapsulation required for
    successful delivery is left untouched by transit network elements.
    DOTS servers and DOTS clients cannot assume any preferential
    treatment of DOTS signals. Such preferential treatment may be
    available in some deployments (e.g., intra-domain scenarios), and
    the DOTS architecture does not preclude its use when available.
    However, DOTS itself does not address how that may be
    done.[¶](#section-1.3-2.6){.pilcrow}]{#section-1.3-2.6}
-   [The architecture allows for, but does not assume, the presence of
    Quality-of-Service (QoS) policy agreements between DOTS-enabled peer
    networks or local QoS prioritization aimed at ensuring delivery of
    DOTS messages between DOTS agents. QoS is an operational
    consideration only, not a functional part of the DOTS
    architecture.[¶](#section-1.3-2.7){.pilcrow}]{#section-1.3-2.7}
-   [The signal and data channels are loosely coupled and might not
    terminate on the same DOTS server. How the DOTS servers synchronize
    the DOTS configuration is out of scope of this
    specification.[¶](#section-1.3-2.8){.pilcrow}]{#section-1.3-2.8}

[Figure 1](#figure-1){.selfRef}: [Basic DOTS
Architecture](#name-basic-dots-architecture){.selfRef}
:::

A simple example instantiation of the DOTS architecture could be an
enterprise as the attack target for a volumetric DDoS attack and an
upstream DDoS mitigation service as the mitigator. The service provided
by the mitigator is called \"DDoS mitigation service\". The enterprise
(attack target) is connected to the Internet via a link that is getting
saturated, and the enterprise suspects it is under DDoS attack. The
enterprise has a DOTS client, which obtains information about the DDoS
attack and signals the DOTS server for help in mitigating the attack. In
turn, the DOTS server invokes one or more mitigators, which are tasked
with mitigating the actual DDoS attack and, hence, aim to suppress the
attack traffic while allowing valid traffic to reach the attack
target.[¶](#section-2-3){.pilcrow}

The scope of the DOTS specifications is the interfaces between the DOTS
client and DOTS server. The interfaces to the attack target and the
mitigator are out of scope of DOTS. Similarly, the operation of both the
attack target and the mitigator is out of scope of DOTS. Thus, DOTS
specifies neither how an attack target decides it is under DDoS attack
nor does DOTS specify how a mitigator may actually mitigate such an
attack. A DOTS client\'s request for mitigation is advisory in nature
and might not lead to any mitigation at all, depending on the DOTS
server domain\'s capacity and willingness to mitigate on behalf of the
DOTS client domain.[¶](#section-2-4){.pilcrow}

The DOTS client may be provided with a list of DOTS servers, each
associated with one or more IP addresses. These addresses may or may not
be of the same address family. The DOTS client establishes one or more
sessions by connecting to the provided DOTS server
addresses.[¶](#section-2-5){.pilcrow}

As illustrated in [Figure 2](#fig-interfaces){.xref}, there are two
interfaces between a DOTS server and a DOTS client: a signal channel and
(optionally) a data channel.[¶](#section-2-6){.pilcrow}

[Figure 2](#figure-2){.selfRef}: [DOTS
Interfaces](#name-dots-interfaces){.selfRef}
:::

The primary purpose of the signal channel is for a DOTS client to ask a
DOTS server for help in mitigating an attack and for the DOTS server to
inform the DOTS client about the status of such mitigation. The DOTS
client does this by sending a client signal that contains information
about the attack target(s). The client signal may also include telemetry
information about the attack, if the DOTS client has such information
available. In turn, the DOTS server sends a server signal to inform the
DOTS client of whether it will honor the mitigation request. Assuming it
will, the DOTS server initiates attack mitigation and periodically
informs the DOTS client about the status of the mitigation. Similarly,
the DOTS client periodically informs the DOTS server about the client\'s
status, which, at a minimum, provides client (attack target) health
information; it should also include efficacy information about the
attack mitigation as it is now seen by the client. At some point, the
DOTS client may decide to terminate the server-side attack mitigation,
which it indicates to the DOTS server over the signal channel. A
mitigation may also be terminated if a DOTS client-specified mitigation
lifetime is exceeded. Note that the signal channel may need to operate
over a link that is experiencing a DDoS attack and, hence, is subject to
severe packet loss and high latency.[¶](#section-2-8){.pilcrow}

While DOTS is able to request mitigation with just the signal channel,
the addition of the DOTS data channel provides for additional, more
efficient capabilities. The primary purpose of the data channel is to
support DOTS-related configuration and policy information exchange
between the DOTS client and the DOTS server. Examples of such
information include, but are not limited to:[¶](#section-2-9){.pilcrow}

-   [Creating identifiers, such as names or aliases, for resources for
    which mitigation may be requested. Such identifiers may then be used
    in subsequent signal channel exchanges to refer more efficiently to
    the resources under
    attack.[¶](#section-2-10.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-2-10.1}

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   [Drop-list management, which enables a DOTS client to inform the
    DOTS server about sources to
    suppress.[¶](#section-2-11.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-2-11.1}
-   [Accept-list management, which enables a DOTS client to inform the
    DOTS server about sources from which traffic is always
    accepted.[¶](#section-2-11.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-2-11.2}
-   [Filter management, which enables a DOTS client to install or remove

-   [DOTS client
    provisioning.[¶](#section-2-11.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-2-11.4}

Note that, while it is possible to exchange the above information
before, during, or after a DDoS attack, DOTS requires reliable delivery
of this information and does not provide any special means for ensuring
timely delivery of it during an attack. In practice, this means that
DOTS deployments should rely on such information being exchanged only
under normal traffic conditions.[¶](#section-2-12){.pilcrow}

::: {#operations}
::: {#section-2.1 .section}
### [2.1.](#section-2.1){.section-number .selfRef} [DOTS Operations](#name-dots-operations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-dots-operations}

DOTS does not prescribe any specific deployment models; however, DOTS is
designed with some specific requirements around the different DOTS
agents and their relationships.[¶](#section-2.1-1){.pilcrow}

First of all, a DOTS agent belongs to a domain that has an identity that
can be authenticated and authorized. DOTS agents communicate with each
other over a mutually authenticated signal channel and (optionally) data
channel. However, before they can do so, a service relationship needs to
be established between them. The details and means by which this is done
is outside the scope of DOTS; however, an example would be for an
enterprise A (DOTS client) to sign up for DDoS service from provider B
(DOTS server). This would establish a (service) relationship between the
two that enables enterprise A\'s DOTS client to establish a signal
channel with provider B\'s DOTS server. A and B will authenticate each
other, and B can verify that A is authorized for its
service.[¶](#section-2.1-2){.pilcrow}

From an operational and design point of view, DOTS assumes that the
above relationship is established prior to a request for DDoS attack
mitigation. In particular, it is assumed that bidirectional
communication is possible at this time between the DOTS client and DOTS
server. Furthermore, it is assumed that additional service provisioning,
configuration, and information exchange can be performed by use of the
data channel if operationally required. It is not until this point that
the mitigation service is available for
use.[¶](#section-2.1-3){.pilcrow}

Once the mutually authenticated signal channel has been established, it
will remain active. This is done to increase the likelihood that the
DOTS client can signal the DOTS server for help when the attack target
is being flooded, and similarly raise the probability that DOTS server
signals reach the client regardless of inbound link congestion. This
does not necessarily imply that the attack target and the DOTS client
have to be co-located in the same administrative domain, but it is
expected to be a common scenario.[¶](#section-2.1-4){.pilcrow}

DDoS mitigation with the help of an upstream mitigator may involve some
form of traffic redirection whereby traffic destined for the attack
target is steered towards the mitigator. Common mechanisms to achieve
this redirection depend on BGP \[[RFC4271](#RFC4271){.xref}\] and DNS
\[[RFC1035](#RFC1035){.xref}\]. In turn, the mitigator inspects and
scrubs the traffic and forwards the resulting (hopefully non-attack)
traffic to the attack target. Thus, when a DOTS server receives an
attack mitigation request from a DOTS client, it can be viewed as a way
of causing traffic redirection for the attack target
indicated.[¶](#section-2.1-5){.pilcrow}

DOTS relies on mutual authentication and the pre-established service
relationship between the DOTS client domain and the DOTS server domain
to provide authorization. The DOTS server should enforce authorization
mechanisms to restrict the mitigation scope a DOTS client can request,
but such authorization mechanisms are deployment
specific.[¶](#section-2.1-6){.pilcrow}

Although co-location of DOTS server and mitigator within the same domain
is expected to be a common deployment model, it is assumed that
operators may require alternative models. Nothing in this document
precludes such alternatives.[¶](#section-2.1-7){.pilcrow}

A DOTS client is a DOTS agent from which requests for help coordinating
an attack response originate. The requests may be in response to an
active, ongoing attack against a target in the DOTS client domain, but
no active attack is required for a DOTS client to request help.
Operators may wish to have upstream mitigators in the network path for
an indefinite period and are restricted only by business relationships
when it comes to duration and scope of requested
mitigation.[¶](#section-2.2.1-1){.pilcrow}

The DOTS client requests attack response coordination from a DOTS server
over the signal channel, including in the request the DOTS client\'s
desired mitigation scoping, as described in
\[[RFC8612](#RFC8612){.xref}\] (SIG-008). The actual mitigation scope
and countermeasures used in response to the attack are up to the DOTS
server and mitigator operators, as the DOTS client may have a narrow
perspective on the ongoing attack. As such, the DOTS client\'s request
for mitigation should be considered advisory: guarantees of DOTS server
availability or mitigation capacity constitute Service Level Agreements
(SLAs) and are out of scope for this
document.[¶](#section-2.2.1-2){.pilcrow}

The DOTS client adjusts mitigation scope and provides available
mitigation feedback (e.g., mitigation efficacy) at the direction of its
local administrator. Such direction may involve manual or automated
adjustments in response to updates from the DOTS
server.[¶](#section-2.2.1-3){.pilcrow}

To provide a metric of signal health and distinguish an idle signal
channel from a disconnected or defunct session, the DOTS client sends a
heartbeat over the signal channel to maintain its half of the channel.
The DOTS client similarly expects a heartbeat from the DOTS server and
may consider a session terminated in the extended absence of a DOTS
server heartbeat.[¶](#section-2.2.1-4){.pilcrow}
:::
:::

::: {#dots-server}
::: {#section-2.2.2 .section}
#### [2.2.2.](#section-2.2.2){.section-number .selfRef} [DOTS Server](#name-dots-server){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-dots-server}

A DOTS server is a DOTS agent capable of receiving, processing, and
possibly acting on requests for help coordinating attack responses from
DOTS clients. The DOTS server authenticates and authorizes DOTS clients
as described in [Section 3.1](#dots-sessions){.xref} and maintains
session state, tracks requests for mitigation, reports on the status of
active mitigations, and terminates sessions in the extended absence of a
client heartbeat or when a session times
out.[¶](#section-2.2.2-1){.pilcrow}

Assuming the preconditions discussed below exist, a DOTS client
maintaining an active session with a DOTS server may reasonably expect
some level of mitigation in response to a request for coordinated attack
response.[¶](#section-2.2.2-2){.pilcrow}

For a given DOTS client (administrative) domain, the DOTS server needs
to be able to determine whether a given resource is in that domain. For
example, this could take the form of associating a set of IP addresses
and/or prefixes per DOTS client domain. The DOTS server enforces
authorization of signals for mitigation, filtering rules, and aliases
for resources from DOTS clients. The mechanism of enforcement is not in
scope for this document but is expected to restrict mitigation requests,
filtering rules, aliases for addresses and prefixes, and/or services
owned by the DOTS client domain, such that a DOTS client from one domain
is not able to influence the network path to another domain. A DOTS
server [MUST]{.bcp14} reject mitigation requests, filtering rules, and
aliases for resources not owned by the requesting DOTS client\'s
administrative domain. The exact mechanism for the DOTS servers to
validate that the resources are within the scope of the DOTS client
domain is deployment specific. For example, if the DOTS client domain
uses Provider-Aggregatable prefixes for its resources and leverages the
DDoS mitigation service of the Internet Transit Provider (ITP); the ITP
knows the prefixes assigned to the DOTS client domain because they are
assigned by the ITP itself. However, if the DDoS Mitigation is offered
by a third-party DDoS mitigation service provider; it does not know the
resources owned by the DOTS client domain. The DDoS mitigation service
provider and the DOTS client domain can opt to use the identifier
validation challenges discussed in \[[RFC8555](#RFC8555){.xref}\] and
\[[RFC8738](#RFC8738){.xref}\] to identify whether or not the DOTS
client domain actually controls the resources. The challenges for
validating control of resources must be performed when no attack traffic
is present and works only for \"dns\" and \"ip\" identifier types.
Further, if the DOTS client lies about the resources owned by the DOTS
client domain, the DDoS mitigation service provider can impose penalties
for violating the SLA. A DOTS server [MAY]{.bcp14} also refuse a DOTS
client\'s mitigation request for arbitrary reasons, within any limits
imposed by business or SLAs between client and server domains. If a DOTS
server refuses a DOTS client\'s request for mitigation, the DOTS server
[MUST]{.bcp14} include the refusal reason in the server signal sent to
the client.[¶](#section-2.2.2-3){.pilcrow}

A DOTS server is in regular contact with one or more mitigators. If a
DOTS server accepts a DOTS client\'s request for help, the DOTS server
forwards a translated form of that request to the mitigator(s)
responsible for scrubbing attack traffic. Note that the form of the
translated request passed from the DOTS server to the mitigator is not
in scope; it may be as simple as an alert to mitigator operators, or
highly automated using vendor or open application programming interfaces
supported by the mitigator. The DOTS server [MUST]{.bcp14} report the
actual scope of any mitigation enabled on behalf of a
client.[¶](#section-2.2.2-4){.pilcrow}

The DOTS server [SHOULD]{.bcp14} retrieve available metrics for any
mitigations activated on behalf of a DOTS client and [SHOULD]{.bcp14}
include them in server signals sent to the DOTS client originating the
request for mitigation.[¶](#section-2.2.2-5){.pilcrow}

To provide a metric of signal health and distinguish an idle signal
channel from a disconnected or defunct channel, the DOTS server
[MUST]{.bcp14} send a heartbeat over the signal channel to maintain its
half of the channel. The DOTS server similarly expects a heartbeat from
the DOTS client and [MAY]{.bcp14} consider a session terminated in the
extended absence of a DOTS client
heartbeat.[¶](#section-2.2.2-6){.pilcrow}

Traditional client/server relationships may be expanded by chaining DOTS
sessions. This chaining is enabled through \"logical concatenation\" of
a DOTS server and a DOTS client, resulting in an application analogous
to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) \[[RFC3261](#RFC3261){.xref}\]

Deploying a multihomed client requires extra care and planning, as the
DOTS servers with which the multihomed client communicates might not be
affiliated. Should the multihomed client simultaneously request for
mitigation from all servers with which it has established signal
channels, the client may unintentionally inflict additional network
disruption on the resources it intends to protect. In one of the worst
cases, a multihomed DOTS client could cause a permanent routing loop of
traffic destined for the client\'s protected services, as the
uncoordinated DOTS servers\' mitigators all try to divert that traffic
to their own scrubbing centers.[¶](#section-2.3-6){.pilcrow}

The DOTS protocol itself provides no fool-proof method to prevent such
self-inflicted harms as a result of deploying multihomed DOTS clients.
If DOTS client implementations nevertheless include support for
multihoming, they are expected to be aware of the risks, and
consequently to include measures aimed at reducing the likelihood of
negative outcomes. Simple measures might

example is a DOTS gateway at the network client\'s side and another one
at the server side. The first gateway can be located at Customer
Premises Equipment (CPE) to aggregate requests from multiple DOTS

In order for DOTS to be effective as a vehicle for DDoS mitigation
requests, one or more DOTS clients must establish ongoing communication
with one or more DOTS servers. While the preconditions for enabling DOTS
in or among network domains may also involve business relationships,
SLAs, or other formal or informal understandings between network
operators, such considerations are out of scope for this
document.[¶](#section-3.1-1){.pilcrow}

A DOTS session is established to support bilateral exchange of data
between an associated DOTS client and a DOTS server. In the DOTS
architecture, data is exchanged between DOTS agents over signal and data
channels. As such, a DOTS session can be a DOTS signal channel session,
a DOTS data channel session, or both. The DOTS server couples the DOTS
signal and data channel sessions using the DOTS client identity. The
DOTS session is further elaborated in the DOTS signal channel protocol
defined in \[[RFC8782](#RFC8782){.xref}\] and the DOTS data channel
protocol defined in
\[[RFC8783](#RFC8783){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3.1-2){.pilcrow}

A DOTS agent can maintain one or more DOTS
sessions.[¶](#section-3.1-3){.pilcrow}

A DOTS signal channel session is associated with a single transport
connection (TCP or UDP session) and a security association (a TLS or
DTLS session). Similarly, a DOTS data channel session is associated with
a single TCP connection and a TLS security
association.[¶](#section-3.1-4){.pilcrow}

Mitigation requests created using the DOTS signal channel are not bound
to the DOTS signal channel session. Instead, mitigation requests are
associated with a DOTS client and can be managed using different DOTS
signal channel sessions.[¶](#section-3.1-5){.pilcrow}

::: {#dots-session-preconditions}

#### [3.1.1.](#section-3.1.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Preconditions](#name-preconditions){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-preconditions}

Prior to establishing a DOTS session between agents, the owners of the
networks, domains, services or applications involved are assumed to have
agreed upon the terms of the relationship involved. Such agreements are
out of scope for this document but must be in place for a functional
DOTS architecture.[¶](#section-3.1.1-1){.pilcrow}

It is assumed that, as part of any DOTS service agreement, the DOTS
client is provided with all data and metadata required to establish
communication with the DOTS server. Such data and metadata would include
any cryptographic information necessary to meet the message
confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity requirement (SEC-002) in
\[[RFC8612](#RFC8612){.xref}\] and might also include the pool of DOTS
server addresses and ports the DOTS client should use for signal and
data channel messaging.[¶](#section-3.1.1-2){.pilcrow}

#### [3.1.2.](#section-3.1.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Establishing the DOTS Session](#name-establishing-the-dots-sessi){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-establishing-the-dots-sessi}

With the required business agreements in place, the DOTS client
initiates a DOTS session by contacting its DOTS server(s) over the
signal channel and (possibly) the data channel. To allow for DOTS
service flexibility, neither the order of contact nor the time interval
between channel creations is specified. A DOTS client [MAY]{.bcp14}
establish the signal channel first, and then the data channel, or vice
versa.[¶](#section-3.1.2-1){.pilcrow}

The methods by which a DOTS client receives the address and associated
service details of the DOTS server are not prescribed by this document.
For example, a DOTS client may be directly configured to use a specific
DOTS server IP address and port, and be directly provided with any data
necessary to satisfy the Peer Mutual Authentication requirement
(SEC-001) in \[[RFC8612](#RFC8612){.xref}\], such as symmetric or
asymmetric keys, usernames, passwords, etc. All configuration and
authentication information in this scenario is provided out of band by
the domain operating the DOTS server.[¶](#section-3.1.2-2){.pilcrow}

At the other extreme, the architecture in this document allows for a
form of DOTS client auto-provisioning. For example, the domain operating
the DOTS server or servers might provide the client domain only with
symmetric or asymmetric keys to authenticate the provisioned DOTS
clients. Only the keys would then be directly configured on DOTS
clients, but the remaining configuration required to provision the DOTS
clients could be learned through mechanisms similar to DNS SRV
\[[RFC2782](#RFC2782){.xref}\] or DNS Service Discovery
\[[RFC6763](#RFC6763){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3.1.2-3){.pilcrow}

The DOTS client [SHOULD]{.bcp14} successfully authenticate and exchange
messages with the DOTS server over both the signal and (if used) data
channel as soon as possible to confirm that both channels are
operational.[¶](#section-3.1.2-4){.pilcrow}

As described in \[[RFC8612](#RFC8612){.xref}\] (DM-008), the DOTS client
can configure preferred values for acceptable signal loss, mitigation
lifetime, and heartbeat intervals when establishing the DOTS signal
channel session. A DOTS signal channel session is not active until DOTS
agents have agreed on the values for these DOTS session parameters, a
process defined by the protocol.[¶](#section-3.1.2-5){.pilcrow}

Once the DOTS client begins receiving DOTS server signals, the DOTS
session is active. At any time during the DOTS session, the DOTS client
may use the data channel to manage aliases, manage drop- and
accept-listed prefixes or addresses, leverage vendor-specific
extensions, and so on. Note that unlike the signal channel, there is no
requirement that the data channel remains operational in attack
conditions. (See \"Data Channel Requirements\" [Section
2.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8612#section-2.3){.relref} of
\[[RFC8612](#RFC8612){.xref}\]).[¶](#section-3.1.2-6){.pilcrow}

DOTS clients and servers periodically send heartbeats to each other over
the signal channel, discussed in \[[RFC8612](#RFC8612){.xref}\]
(SIG-004). DOTS agent operators [SHOULD]{.bcp14} configure the heartbeat
interval such that the frequency does not lead to accidental denials of
service due to the overwhelming number of heartbeats a DOTS agent must
field.[¶](#section-3.1.3-1){.pilcrow}

Either DOTS agent may consider a DOTS signal channel session terminated
in the extended absence of a heartbeat from its peer agent. The period
of that absence will be established in the protocol
definition.[¶](#section-3.1.3-2){.pilcrow}

DOTS is centered around improving the speed and efficiency of a
coordinated response to DDoS attacks. One scenario not yet discussed
involves coordination among federated domains operating DOTS servers and
mitigators.[¶](#section-3.2.3-1){.pilcrow}

In the course of normal DOTS operations, a DOTS client communicates the
need for mitigation to a DOTS server, and that server initiates
mitigation on a mitigator with which the server has an established
service relationship. The operator of the mitigator may in turn monitor
mitigation performance and capacity, as the attack being mitigated may
grow in severity beyond the mitigating domain\'s
capabilities.[¶](#section-3.2.3-2){.pilcrow}

The operator of the mitigator has limited options in the event a DOTS
client-requested mitigation is being overwhelmed by the severity of the
attack. Out-of-scope business or SLAs may permit the mitigating domain
to drop the mitigation and let attack traffic flow unchecked to the
target, but this only encourages attack escalation. In the case where
the mitigating domain is the upstream service provider for the attack
target, this may mean the mitigating domain and its other services and
users continue to suffer the incidental effects of the
attack.[¶](#section-3.2.3-3){.pilcrow}

A recursive signaling model as shown in [Figure
12](#fig-recursive-signaling){.xref} offers an alternative. In a
variation of the use case \"Upstream DDoS Mitigation by an Upstream
Internet Transit Provider\" described in
\[[DOTS-USE-CASES](#I-D.ietf-dots-use-cases){.xref}\], a domain
operating a DOTS server and mitigator also operates a DOTS client. This
DOTS client has an established DOTS session with a DOTS server belonging
to a separate administrative domain.[¶](#section-3.2.3-4){.pilcrow}

With these preconditions in place, the operator of the mitigator being
overwhelmed or otherwise performing inadequately may request mitigation
for the attack target from this separate DOTS-aware domain. Such a
request recurses the originating mitigation request to the secondary
DOTS server in the hope of building a cumulative mitigation against the
attack.[¶](#section-3.2.3-5){.pilcrow}

In [Figure 12](#fig-recursive-signaling){.xref}, client Cc signals a
request for mitigation across inter-domain DOTS session 1 to the DOTS
server Sn belonging to the example.net domain. DOTS server Sn enables
mitigation on mitigator Mn. DOTS server Sn is half of DOTS gateway Gn,
being deployed logically back to back with DOTS client Cn, which has
preexisting inter-domain DOTS session 2 with the DOTS server So
belonging to the example.org domain. At any point, DOTS server Sn
[MAY]{.bcp14} recurse an ongoing mitigation request through DOTS client
Cn to DOTS server So, in the expectation that mitigator Mo will be
activated to aid in the defense of the attack
target.[¶](#section-3.2.3-7){.pilcrow}

Recursive signaling is opaque to the DOTS client. To maximize mitigation
visibility to the DOTS client, however, the recursing domain
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} provide recursed mitigation feedback in signals
reporting on mitigation status to the DOTS client. For example, the
recursing domain\'s DOTS server should incorporate available metrics
such as dropped packet or byte counts from the recursed domain\'s DOTS
server into mitigation status messages.[¶](#section-3.2.3-8){.pilcrow}

DOTS clients involved in recursive signaling must be able to withdraw
requests for mitigation without warning or justification per SIG-006 in
\[[RFC8612](#RFC8612){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3.2.3-9){.pilcrow}

Operators recursing mitigation requests [MAY]{.bcp14} maintain the
recursed mitigation for a brief protocol-defined period in the event the
DOTS client originating the mitigation withdraws its request for help,
as per the discussion of managing mitigation toggling in SIG-006 of
\[[RFC8612](#RFC8612){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3.2.3-10){.pilcrow}

Deployment of recursive signaling may result in traffic redirection,
examination, and mitigation extending beyond the initial bilateral
relationship between DOTS client and DOTS server. As such, client
control over the network path of mitigated traffic may be reduced. DOTS
client operators should be aware of any privacy concerns and work with
DOTS server operators employing recursive signaling to ensure shared
sensitive material is suitably protected. Typically, there is a
contractual SLA negotiated among the DOTS client domain, the recursed
domain, and the recursing domain to meet the privacy requirements of the
DOTS client domain and authorization for the recursing domain to request
mitigation for the resources controlled by the DOTS client
domain.[¶](#section-3.2.3-11){.pilcrow}

As long as network configuration remains stable, anycast DOTS signaling
is to the individual DOTS client indistinct from direct signaling.
However, the operational challenges inherent in anycast signaling are
anything but negligible, and DOTS server operators must carefully weigh
the risks against the benefits before
deploying.[¶](#section-3.2.4.1-1){.pilcrow}

While the DOTS signal channel primarily operates over UDP per SIG-001 in
\[[RFC8612](#RFC8612){.xref}\], the signal channel also requires mutual
authentication between DOTS agents, with associated security state on
both ends.[¶](#section-3.2.4.1-2){.pilcrow}

Network instability is of particular concern with anycast signaling, as
DOTS signal channels are expected to be long lived and potentially
operating under congested network conditions caused by a volumetric DDoS
attack.[¶](#section-3.2.4.1-3){.pilcrow}

For example, a network configuration altering the route to the DOTS
server during active anycast signaling may cause the DOTS client to send
messages to a DOTS server other than the one with which it initially
established a signaling session. That second DOTS server might not have
the security state of the existing session, forcing the DOTS client to
initialize a new DOTS session. This challenge might in part be mitigated
by use of resumption via a pre-shared key (PSK) in TLS 1.3
\[[RFC8446](#RFC8446){.xref}\] and DTLS 1.3
\[[DTLS-PROTOCOL](#I-D.ietf-tls-dtls13){.xref}\] (session resumption in
TLS 1.2 \[[RFC5246](#RFC5246){.xref}\] and DTLS 1.2
\[[RFC6347](#RFC6347){.xref}\]), but keying material must then be
available to all DOTS servers sharing the anycast Service Address, which
has operational challenges of its own.[¶](#section-3.2.4.1-4){.pilcrow}

While the DOTS client will try to establish a new DOTS session with the
DOTS server now acting as the anycast DOTS Service Address, the link
between DOTS client and server may be congested with attack traffic,
making signal session establishment difficult. In such a scenario,
anycast Service Address instability becomes a sort of signal session
flapping, with obvious negative consequences for the DOTS
deployment.[¶](#section-3.2.4.1-5){.pilcrow}

Anycast signaling deployments similarly must also take into account
active mitigations. Active mitigations initiated through a DOTS session
may involve diverting traffic to a scrubbing center. If the DOTS session
flaps due to anycast changes as described above, mitigation may also
flap as the DOTS servers sharing the anycast DOTS service address
toggles mitigation on detecting DOTS session loss, depending on whether
or not the client has configured mitigation on loss of signal ([Section
3.3.3](#auto-mit-signal-loss){.xref}).[¶](#section-3.2.4.1-6){.pilcrow}

Network address translators (NATs) are expected to be a common feature
of DOTS deployments. The middlebox traversal guidelines in
\[[RFC8085](#RFC8085){.xref}\] include general NAT considerations that
are applicable to DOTS deployments when the signal channel is
established over UDP.[¶](#section-3.2.5-1){.pilcrow}

Additional DOTS-specific considerations arise when NATs are part of the
DOTS architecture. For example, DDoS attack detection behind a NAT will
detect attacks against internal addresses. A DOTS client subsequently
asked to request mitigation for the attacked scope of addresses cannot
reasonably perform the task, due to the lack of externally routable
addresses in the mitigation scope.[¶](#section-3.2.5-2){.pilcrow}

The following considerations do not cover all possible scenarios but are
meant rather to highlight anticipated common issues when signaling
through NATs.[¶](#section-3.2.5-3){.pilcrow}

Operators may circumvent the problem of translating internal addresses
or prefixes to externally routable mitigation scopes by directly
provisioning the mappings of external addresses to internal protected
resources on the DOTS client. When the operator requests mitigation
scoped for internal addresses, directly or through automated means, the
DOTS client looks up the matching external addresses or prefixes and
issues a mitigation request scoped to that externally routable
information.[¶](#section-3.2.5.1-1){.pilcrow}

When directly provisioning the address mappings, operators must ensure
the mappings remain up to date or they risk losing the ability to
request accurate mitigation scopes. To that aim, the DOTS client can
rely on mechanisms such as \[[RFC8512](#RFC8512){.xref}\] or
\[[RFC7658](#RFC7658){.xref}\] to retrieve static explicit mappings.
This document does not prescribe the method by which mappings are
maintained once they are provisioned on the DOTS
client.[¶](#section-3.2.5.1-2){.pilcrow}

Port Control Protocol (PCP) \[[RFC6887](#RFC6887){.xref}\] may be used
to retrieve the external addresses/prefixes and/or port numbers if the
NAT function embeds a PCP server.[¶](#section-3.2.5.2-1){.pilcrow}

A DOTS client can use the information retrieved by means of PCP to feed
the DOTS protocol(s) messages that will be sent to a DOTS server. These
messages will convey the external addresses/prefixes as set by the
NAT.[¶](#section-3.2.5.2-2){.pilcrow}

PCP also enables discovery and configuration of the lifetime of port
mappings instantiated in intermediate NAT devices. Discovery of port
mapping lifetimes can reduce the dependency on heartbeat messages to
maintain mappings and, therefore, reduce the load on DOTS servers and
the network.[¶](#section-3.2.5.2-3){.pilcrow}

An internal resource, e.g., a web server, can discover its reflexive
transport address through a STUN Binding request/response transaction,
as described in \[[RFC8489](#RFC8489){.xref}\]. After learning its
reflexive transport address from the STUN server, the internal resource
can export its reflexive transport address and internal transport
address to the DOTS client, thereby enabling the DOTS client to request
mitigation with the correct external scope, as depicted in [Figure
13](#fig-nat-stun){.xref}. The mechanism for providing the DOTS client
with the reflexive transport address and internal transport address is
unspecified in this document.[¶](#section-3.2.5.3-1){.pilcrow}

In order to prevent an attacker from modifying the STUN messages in
transit, the STUN client and server must use the message-integrity
mechanism discussed in [Section
9](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8489#section-9){.relref} of
\[[RFC8489](#RFC8489){.xref}\] or use STUN over DTLS

behind a NAT that performs Endpoint-Dependent Mapping
\[[RFC5128](#RFC5128){.xref}\], the internal service cannot provide the
DOTS client with the reflexive transport address discovered using STUN.
The behavior of a NAT between the STUN client and the STUN server could
be discovered using the experimental techniques discussed in
\[[RFC5780](#RFC5780){.xref}\], but note that there is currently no
standardized way for a STUN client to reliably determine if it is behind
a NAT that performs Endpoint-Dependent

DOTS supports mitigation scoped to DNS names. As discussed in
\[[RFC3235](#RFC3235){.xref}\], using DNS names instead of IP addresses
potentially avoids the address translation problem, as long as the same
domain name is internally and externally resolvable. For example, a
detected attack\'s internal target address can be mapped to a DNS name
through a reverse lookup. The DNS name returned by the reverse lookup
can then be provided to the DOTS client as the external scope for
mitigation. For the reverse DNS lookup, DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC)
\[[RFC4033](#RFC4033){.xref}\] must be used where the authenticity of
response is critical.[¶](#section-3.2.5.4-1){.pilcrow}

### [3.3.](#section-3.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Triggering Requests for Mitigation](#name-triggering-requests-for-mit){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-triggering-requests-for-mit}

\[[RFC8612](#RFC8612){.xref}\] places no limitation on the circumstances
in which a DOTS client operator may request mitigation, nor does it
demand justification for any mitigation request, thereby reserving
operational control over DDoS defense for the domain requesting
mitigation. This architecture likewise does not prescribe the network
conditions and mechanisms triggering a mitigation request from a DOTS
client.[¶](#section-3.3-1){.pilcrow}

However, considering selected possible mitigation triggers from an
architectural perspective offers a model for alternative or
unanticipated triggers for DOTS deployments. In all cases, what network
conditions merit a mitigation request are at the discretion of the DOTS
client operator.[¶](#section-3.3-2){.pilcrow}

The mitigation request itself is defined by DOTS; however, the
interfaces required to trigger the mitigation request in the following
scenarios are implementation specific.[¶](#section-3.3-3){.pilcrow}

::: {#manual-mit-request}
::: {#section-3.3.1 .section}
#### [3.3.1.](#section-3.3.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Manual Mitigation Request](#name-manual-mitigation-request){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-manual-mitigation-request}

A DOTS client operator may manually prepare a request for mitigation,
including scope and duration, and manually instruct the DOTS client to
send the mitigation request to the DOTS server. In context, a manual
request is a request directly issued by the operator without automated
decision making performed by a device interacting with the DOTS client.
Modes of manual mitigation requests include an operator entering a
command into a text interface, or directly interacting with a graphical
interface to send the request.[¶](#section-3.3.1-1){.pilcrow}

An operator might do this, for example, in response to notice of an
attack delivered by attack detection equipment or software, and the
alerting detector lacks interfaces or is not configured to use available
interfaces to translate the alert to a mitigation request
automatically.[¶](#section-3.3.1-2){.pilcrow}

In a variation of the above scenario, the operator may have
preconfigured on the DOTS client mitigation requests for various
resources in the operator\'s domain. When notified of an attack, the
DOTS client operator manually instructs the DOTS client to send the
relevant preconfigured mitigation request for the resources under
attack.[¶](#section-3.3.1-3){.pilcrow}

A further variant involves recursive signaling, as described in [Section
3.2.3](#recursive-signaling){.xref}. The DOTS client in this case is the
second half of a DOTS gateway (back-to-back DOTS server and client). As
in the previous scenario, the scope and duration of the mitigation
request are preexisting but, in this case, are derived from the
mitigation request received from a downstream DOTS client by the DOTS
server. Assuming the preconditions required by [Section
3.2.3](#recursive-signaling){.xref} are in place, the DOTS gateway
operator may at any time manually request mitigation from an upstream
DOTS server, sending a mitigation request derived from the downstream
DOTS client\'s request.[¶](#section-3.3.1-4){.pilcrow}

The motivations for a DOTS client operator to request mitigation
manually are not prescribed by this architecture but are expected to
include some of the following:[¶](#section-3.3.1-5){.pilcrow}

-   [Notice of an attack delivered via email or alternative

Unlike manual mitigation requests, which depend entirely on the DOTS
client operator\'s capacity to react with speed and accuracy to every
detected or detectable attack, mitigation requests triggered by detected
attack conditions reduce the operational burden on the DOTS client
operator and minimize the latency between attack detection and the start
of mitigation.[¶](#section-3.3.2-1){.pilcrow}

Mitigation requests are triggered in this scenario by operator-specified
network conditions. Attack detection is deployment specific and not
constrained by this architecture. Similarly, the specifics of a
condition are left to the discretion of the operator, though common
conditions meriting mitigation include the
following:[¶](#section-3.3.2-2){.pilcrow}

-   [Detected attack exceeding a rate in packets per second
    (pps).[¶](#section-3.3.2-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.3.2-3.1}

    above.[¶](#section-3.3.2-3.9){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.3.2-3.9}

When automated conditional mitigation requests are enabled, violations
of any of the above conditions, or any additional operator-defined
conditions, will trigger a mitigation request from the DOTS client to
the DOTS server. The interfaces between the application detecting the
condition violation and the DOTS client are implementation
specific.[¶](#section-3.3.2-4){.pilcrow}

To maintain a DOTS signal channel session, the DOTS client and the DOTS
server exchange regular but infrequent messages across the signal
channel. In the absence of an attack, the probability of message loss in
the signaling channel should be extremely low. Under attack conditions,
however, some signal loss may be anticipated as attack traffic congests
the link, depending on the attack type.[¶](#section-3.3.3-1){.pilcrow}

While \[[RFC8612](#RFC8612){.xref}\] specifies the DOTS protocol be
robust when signaling under attack conditions, there are nevertheless
scenarios in which the DOTS signal is lost in spite of protocol best
efforts. To handle such scenarios, a DOTS operator may request one or
more mitigations, which are triggered only when the DOTS server ceases
receiving DOTS client heartbeats beyond the miss count or interval
permitted by the protocol.[¶](#section-3.3.3-2){.pilcrow}

The impact of mitigating due to loss of signal in either direction must
be considered carefully before enabling it. Attack traffic congesting
links is not the only reason why signal could be lost, and as such,
mitigation requests triggered by signal channel degradation in either
direction may incur unnecessary costs due to scrubbing traffic,
adversely impact network performance and operational expense
alike.[¶](#section-3.3.3-3){.pilcrow}

This section describes identified security considerations for the DOTS
architecture.[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

Security considerations and security requirements discussed in
\[[RFC8612](#RFC8612){.xref}\] need to be taken into
account.[¶](#section-5-2){.pilcrow}

DOTS is at risk from three primary attack vectors: agent impersonation,
traffic injection, and signal blocking. These vectors may be exploited
individually or in concert by an attacker to confuse, disable, take
information from, or otherwise inhibit DOTS
agents.[¶](#section-5-3){.pilcrow}

Any attacker with the ability to impersonate a legitimate DOTS client or
server or, indeed, inject false messages into the stream may potentially
trigger/withdraw traffic redirection, trigger/cancel mitigation
activities or subvert drop-/accept-lists. From an architectural
standpoint, operators [MUST]{.bcp14} ensure conformance to the security
requirements defined in [Section
2.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8612#section-2.4){.relref} of
\[[RFC8612](#RFC8612){.xref}\] to secure data in transit. Similarly, as
the received data may contain network topology, telemetry, and threat
and mitigation information that could be considered sensitive in certain
environments, it [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be protected at rest per required
local policy.[¶](#section-5-4){.pilcrow}

DOTS agents [MUST]{.bcp14} perform mutual authentication to ensure
authenticity of each other, and DOTS servers [MUST]{.bcp14} verify that
the requesting DOTS client is authorized to request mitigation for
specific target resources (see [Section
2.2.2](#dots-server){.xref}).[¶](#section-5-5){.pilcrow}

A man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacker can intercept and drop packets,
preventing the DOTS peers from receiving some or all of the DOTS
messages; automated mitigation on loss of signal can be used as a
countermeasure but with risks discussed in [Section
3.3.3](#auto-mit-signal-loss){.xref}.[¶](#section-5-6){.pilcrow}

An attacker with control of a DOTS client may negatively influence
network traffic by requesting and withdrawing requests for mitigation
for particular prefixes, leading to route or DNS flapping. DOTS
operators should carefully monitor and audit DOTS clients to detect
misbehavior and deter misuse.[¶](#section-5-7){.pilcrow}

Any attack targeting the availability of DOTS servers may disrupt the
ability of the system to receive and process DOTS signals resulting in
failure to fulfill a mitigation request. DOTS servers [MUST]{.bcp14} be
given adequate protections in accordance with best current practices for
network and host security.[¶](#section-5-8){.pilcrow}
