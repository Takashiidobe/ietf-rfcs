This document is a product of and represents the collaborative work and
consensus of the Coding for Efficient Network Communications Research
Group (NWCRG); while it is not an IETF product and not a standard, it is
intended to inform the SATellite COMmunication (SATCOM) and Internet
research communities about recent developments in Network Coding. A
glossary is included in [Section 6](#sec_glossary){.xref} to clarify the
terminology used throughout the document.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

As will be shown in this document, the implementation of Network Coding
techniques above the network layer, at application or transport layers
(as described in \[[RFC1122](#RFC1122){.xref}\]), offers an opportunity
for improving the end-to-end performance of SATCOM systems. Physical-
and link-layer coding error protection is usually enough to provide
quasi-error-free transmission, thus minimizing packet loss. However,
when residual errors at those layers cause packet losses,
retransmissions add significant delays (in particular, in geostationary
systems with over 0.7 second round-trip delays). Hence, the use of
Network Coding at the upper layers can improve the quality of service in
SATCOM subnetworks and eventually favorably impact the experience of end
users.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

While there is an active research community working on Network Coding
techniques above the network layer in general and in SATCOM in
particular, not much of this work has been deployed in commercial
systems. In this context, this document identifies opportunities for
further usage of Network Coding in commercial SATCOM
networks.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

The notation used in this document is based on the NWCRG taxonomy

There are multiple SATCOM systems, for example, broadcast TV, point-to
point-communication, and Internet of Things (IoT) monitoring. Therefore,
depending on the purpose of the system, the associated ground segment
architecture will be different. This section focuses on a satellite
system that follows the European Telecommunications Standards Institute
(ETSI) Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) standards to provide broadband
Internet access via ground-based gateways
\[[ETSI-EN-2020](#ETSI-EN-2020){.xref}\]. One must note that the overall
data capacity of one satellite may be higher than the capacity that one
single gateway supports. Hence, there are usually multiple gateways for
one unique satellite platform.[¶](#section-2-1){.pilcrow}

In this context, [Figure 1](#fig_sat_gateway){.xref} shows an example of
a multigateway satellite system, where BBFRAME stands for \"Base-Band
FRAME\", PLFRAME for \"Physical Layer FRAME\", and PEP for \"Performance
Enhancing Proxy\". More information on a generic SATCOM ground segment
architecture for bidirectional Internet access can be found in
\[[SAT2017](#SAT2017){.xref}\] or in DVB standard
documents.[¶](#section-2-2){.pilcrow}

This use case considers two-way communication between end users through
a satellite link, as seen in [Figure

Satellite terminal A sends a packet flow A, and satellite terminal B
sends a packet flow B, to a coding server. The coding server then sends
a combination of both flows instead of each individual flow. This
results in non-negligible capacity savings, which has been demonstrated
in the past \[[ASMS2010](#ASMS2010){.xref}\]. In the example, a
dedicated coding server is introduced (note that its location could be
different based on deployment use case). The Network Coding operations
could also be done at the satellite level, although this would require a
lot of computational resources onboard and may not be supported by
today\'s satellites.[¶](#section-3.1-2){.pilcrow}

The use of multicast servers is one way to better utilize satellite
broadcast capabilities. As one example, satellite-based multicast is
proposed in the Secure Hybrid In Network caching Environment (SHINE)
project of the European Space Agency (ESA)
\[[NETCOD-FUNCTION-VIRT](#I-D.vazquez-nfvrg-netcod-function-virtualization){.xref}\]
\[[SHINE](#SHINE){.xref}\]. This use case considers adding redundancy to
a multicast flow depending on what has been received by different end
users, resulting in non-negligible savings of the scarce SATCOM
resources. This scenario is shown in [Figure

A multicast flow (M) is forwarded to both satellite terminals A and B. M
is composed of packets Nk (not shown in [Figure
3](#fig_rel_multi){.xref}). Packet Ni (respectively Nj) gets lost at
terminal A (respectively B), and terminal A (respectively B) returns a
negative acknowledgment Li (respectively Lj), indicating that the packet
is missing. Using coding, either the access gateway or the multicast
server can include a repair packet (rather than the individual Ni and Nj
packets) in the multicast flow to let both terminals recover from
losses.[¶](#section-3.2-3){.pilcrow}

This could also be achieved by using other multicast or broadcast
systems, such as NACK-Oriented Reliable Multicast (NORM)
\[[RFC5740](#RFC5740){.xref}\] or File Delivery over Unidirectional
Transport (FLUTE) \[[RFC6726](#RFC6726){.xref}\]. Both NORM and FLUTE
are limited to block coding; neither of them supports more flexible
sliding window encoding schemes that allow decoding before receiving the
whole block, which is an added delay benefit

### [3.3.](#section-3.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Hybrid Access](#name-hybrid-access){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-hybrid-access}

This use case considers improving multiple-path communications with
Network Coding at the transport layer (see [Figure
4](#fig_hyb_access){.xref}, where DSL stands for \"Digital Subscriber
Line\", LTE for \"Long Term Evolution\", and SAT for \"SATellite\").
This use case is inspired by the Broadband Access via Integrated
Terrestrial Satellite Systems (BATS) project and has been published as
an ETSI Technical Report
\[[ETSI-TR-2017](#ETSI-TR-2017){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3.3-1){.pilcrow}

To cope with packet loss (due to either end-user mobility or
physical-layer residual errors), Network Coding can be introduced.
Depending on the protocol, Network Coding could be applied at the
Customer Premises Equipment (CPE), the concentrator, or both. Apart from
coping with packet loss, other benefits of this approach include a
better tolerance for out-of-order packet delivery, which occurs when
exploited links exhibit high asymmetry in terms of Round-Trip Time
(RTT). Depending on the ground architecture
\[[5G-CORE-YANG](#I-D.chin-nfvrg-cloud-5g-core-structure-yang){.xref}\]
\[[SAT2017](#SAT2017){.xref}\], some ground equipment might be hosting
both SATCOM and cellular network
functionality.[¶](#section-3.3-2){.pilcrow}

This use case considers using Network Coding in the scenario where a
lossy WiFi link is used to connect to the SATCOM network. When encrypted
end-to-end applications based on UDP are used, a Performance Enhancing
Proxy (PEP) cannot operate; hence, other mechanisms need to be used. The
WiFi packet losses will result in an end-to-end retransmission that will
harm the quality of the end user\'s experience and poorly utilize SATCOM
bottleneck resources for traffic that does not generate revenue. In this
use case, adding Network Coding techniques will prevent the end-to-end
retransmission from occurring since the packet losses would probably be
recovered.[¶](#section-3.4-1){.pilcrow}

This use case considers the usage of Network Coding to cope with
subsecond physical channel condition changes where the physical-layer
mechanisms (Adaptive Coding and Modulation (ACM)) may not adapt the
modulation and error-correction coding in time; the residual errors lead
to higher-layer packet losses that can be recovered with Network Coding.
This use case is mostly relevant when mobile users are considered or
when the satellite frequency band introduces quick changes in channel
condition (Q/V bands, Ka band, etc.). Depending on the use case (e.g.,
bands with very high frequency, mobile users), the relevance of adding
Network Coding is different.[¶](#section-3.5-1){.pilcrow}

This use case considers the recovery of packets that may be lost during
gateway handover. Whether for off-loading a given equipment or because
the transmission quality differs from gateway to gateway, switching the
transmission gateway may be beneficial. However, packet losses can occur
if the gateways are not properly synchronized or if the algorithm used
to trigger gateway handover is not properly tuned. During these critical
phases, Network Coding can be added to improve the reliability of the
transmission and allow a seamless gateway
handover.[¶](#section-3.6-1){.pilcrow}

## [4.](#section-4){.section-number .selfRef} [Research Challenges](#name-research-challenges){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-research-challenges}

This section proposes a few potential approaches to introducing and
using Network Coding in SATCOM systems.[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

::: {#sec_deploy_pep}
::: {#section-4.1 .section}
### [4.1.](#section-4.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Joint Use of Network Coding and Congestion Control in SATCOM Systems](#name-joint-use-of-network-coding){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-joint-use-of-network-coding}

Many SATCOM systems typically use Performance Enhancing Proxy (PEP)
\[[RFC3135](#RFC3135){.xref}\]. PEPs usually split end-to-end
connections and forward transport or application-layer packets to the
satellite baseband gateway. PEPs contribute to mitigating congestion in
a SATCOM system by limiting the impact of long delays on Internet
protocols. A PEP mechanism could also include Network Coding operation
and thus support the use cases that have been discussed in [Section
3](#sec_use_cases){.xref} of this document.[¶](#section-4.1-1){.pilcrow}

Deploying Network Coding in the PEP could be relevant and independent
from the specifics of a SATCOM link. This, however, leads to research
questions dealing with the potential interaction between Network Coding
and congestion control. This is discussed in
\[[NWCRG-CODING](#I-D.irtf-nwcrg-coding-and-congestion){.xref}\].[¶](#section-4.1-2){.pilcrow}

### [4.2.](#section-4.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Efficient Use of Satellite Resources](#name-efficient-use-of-satellite-){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-efficient-use-of-satellite-}

There is a recurrent trade-off in SATCOM systems: how much overhead from
redundant reliability packets can be introduced to guarantee a better
end-user Quality of Experience (QoE) while optimizing capacity usage? At
which layer should this supplementary redundancy be
added?[¶](#section-4.2-1){.pilcrow}

This problem has been tackled in the past by the deployment of
physical-layer error-correction codes, but questions remain on adapting
the coding overhead and added delay for, e.g., the quickly varying
channel conditions use case where ACM may not be reacting quickly
enough, as discussed in [Section 3.5](#subsec_varying){.xref}. A higher
layer with Network Coding does not react more quickly than the physical
layer, but it may operate over a packet-based time window that is larger
than the physical one.[¶](#section-4.2-2){.pilcrow}

### [4.3.](#section-4.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Interaction with Virtualized Satellite Gateways and Terminals](#name-interaction-with-virtualize){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-interaction-with-virtualize}

In the emerging virtualized network infrastructure, Network Coding could
be easily deployed as Virtual Network Functions (VNFs). The next
generation of SATCOM ground segments will rely on a virtualized
environment to integrate with terrestrial networks. This trend towards
Network Function Virtualization (NFV) is also central to 5G and
next-generation cellular networks, making this research applicable to
other deployment scenarios
\[[5G-CORE-YANG](#I-D.chin-nfvrg-cloud-5g-core-structure-yang){.xref}\].
As one example, Network Coding VNF deployment in a virtualized
environment has been presented in
\[[NETCOD-FUNCTION-VIRT](#I-D.vazquez-nfvrg-netcod-function-virtualization){.xref}\].[¶](#section-4.3-1){.pilcrow}

A research challenge would be the optimization of the NFV service
function chaining, considering a virtualized infrastructure and other
SATCOM-specific functions, in order to guarantee efficient radio-link
usage and provide easy-to-deploy SATCOM services. Moreover, another
challenge related to virtualized SATCOM equipment is the management of
limited buffered capacities in large
gateways.[¶](#section-4.3-2){.pilcrow}

Communications among deep-space platforms and terrestrial gateways can
be a challenge. Reliable end-to-end (E2E) communications over such paths
must cope with very long delays and frequent link disruptions; indeed,
E2E connectivity may only be available intermittently, if at all.
Delay/Disruption-Tolerant Networking (DTN)
\[[RFC4838](#RFC4838){.xref}\] is a solution to enable reliable
internetworking space communications where neither standard ad hoc
routing nor E2E Internet protocols can be used. Moreover, DTN can also
be seen as an alternative solution to transfer data between a central
PEP and a remote PEP.[¶](#section-4.4-1){.pilcrow}

Network Coding enables E2E reliable communications over a DTN with
potential adaptive re-encoding, as proposed in
\[[THAI15](#THAI15){.xref}\]. Here, the use case proposed in [Section
3.5](#subsec_varying){.xref} would encourage the usage of Network Coding
within the DTN stack to improve utilization of the physical channel and
minimize the effects of the E2E transmission delays. In this context,
the use of packet erasure coding techniques inside a Consultative
Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) architecture has been specified
in \[[CCSDS-131.5-O-1](#CCSDS-131.5-O-1){.xref}\]. One research
challenge remains: how such Network Coding can be integrated in the IETF
DTN stack.[¶](#section-4.4-2){.pilcrow}

This document introduces some wide-scale Network Coding technique
opportunities in satellite telecommunications
systems.[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

Even though this document focuses on satellite systems, it is worth
pointing out that some scenarios proposed here may be relevant to other
wireless telecommunication systems. As one example, the generic
architecture proposed in [Figure 1](#fig_sat_gateway){.xref} may be
mapped onto cellular networks as follows: the \'network function\' block
gathers some of the functions of the Evolved Packet Core subsystem,
while the \'access gateway\' and \'physical gateway\' blocks gather the
same type of functions as the Universal Mobile Terrestrial Radio Access
Network. This mapping extends the opportunities identified in this
document, since they may also be relevant for cellular
networks.[¶](#section-5-2){.pilcrow}

Security considerations are inherent to any access network, in
particular SATCOM systems. As with cellular networks, over-the-air data
can be encrypted using, e.g., the algorithms in
\[[ETSI-TS-2011](#ETSI-TS-2011){.xref}\]. Because the operator may not
enable this \[[SSP-2020](#SSP-2020){.xref}\], the applications should
apply cryptographic protection. The use of FEC or Network Coding in
SATCOM comes with risks (e.g., a single corrupted redundant packet may
propagate to several flows when they are protected together in an
interflow coding approach; see [Section 3](#sec_use_cases){.xref}).
While this document does not further elaborate on this, the security
considerations discussed in \[[RFC6363](#RFC6363){.xref}\]
apply.[¶](#section-8-1){.pilcrow}
