# RFC 8728 {#rfcnum}

# RFC Editor Model (Version 2) {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

The RFC Editor model described in this document divides the
responsibilities for the RFC Series into three functions: the RFC Series
Editor, the RFC Production Center, and the RFC Publisher. Internet
Architecture Board (IAB) oversight via the RFC Series Oversight
Committee (RSOC) is described, as is the relationship between the IETF
Administration Limited Liability Company and the RSOC. This document
reflects the experience gained with \"RFC Editor Model (Version 1)\",
documented in RFC 5620; and obsoletes RFC 6635 to replace all references
to the IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA) and related
structures with those defined by the IASA 2.0
Model.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

This document reflects the experience gained with \"RFC Editor Model
(Version 1)\", documented in \[[RFC5620](#RFC5620){.xref}\], and updates
the RFC Editor Model (Version 2) to be aligned with the new IASA 2.0
Model \[[RFC8711](#RFC8711){.xref}\] that creates the IETF
Administration Limited Liability Company (IETF LLC) managed by a board
of directors (IETF LLC Board). As part of the IASA 2.0 Model, the IETF
Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) is eliminated, and its
oversight and advising functions transferred to the new IETF LLC. This
document obsoletes \[[RFC6635](#RFC6635){.xref}\] to replace all
references to the IASA and related structures with those defined by the
IASA 2.0 Model.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

The IAB, on behalf of the Internet technical community, is concerned
with ensuring the continuity of the RFC Series, orderly RFC Editor
succession, RFC quality, and RFC document accessibility. The IAB is also
sensitive to the concerns of the IETF LLC about providing the necessary
services in a cost-effective and efficient
manner.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

The previous RFC Editor model \[[RFC5620](#RFC5620){.xref}\] was first
approved by the IAB in October 2008, and our understanding of the model
has evolved with our experience since. During the implementation of
version 1 of the model \[[RFC5620](#RFC5620){.xref}\], it was quickly
realized that the role of the RFC Series Editor (RSE) and the oversight
responsibilities needed to be structured differently. In order to gain
experience with \"running code\", a transitional RSE was hired who
analyzed the managerial environment and provided recommendations. This
was followed by the appointment of an acting RSE, who ably managed the
series while work was undertaken to select and hire a permanent RSE.
This version of the model is based on the recommendations of both
temporary RFC Series Editors and the extensive discussion in the IETF
community, on the rfc-interest list, and within the
IAB.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

This document, and the resulting structures, will be modified as needed
through normal procedures. The RSE, and the IAB, through the RFC Series
Oversight Committee (see [Section 3.1](#RSOC){.xref}), will continue to
monitor discussions within the community about potential adjustments to
the RFC Editor model and recognize that the process described in this
document may need to be adjusted to align with any changes that result
from such discussions; hence, the version number in the
title.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

The IAB maintains its responsibilities as defined in
\[[RFC2850](#RFC2850){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}

### [1.1.](#section-1.1){.section-number .selfRef} [The RFC Editor Function](#name-the-rfc-editor-function){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-the-rfc-editor-function}

The RFC Series is described in \[[RFC8729](#RFC8729){.xref}\]. Its
Section
[3.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8729#section-3.1){.relref}
defines \"RFC Editor\":[¶](#section-1.1-1){.pilcrow}

> Originally, there was a single person acting as editor of the RFC
> Series (the RFC Editor). The task has grown, and the work now requires
> the organized activity of several experts, so there are RFC Editors,
> or an RFC Editor organization. In time, there may be multiple
> organizations working together to undertake the work required by the
> RFC Series. For simplicity\'s sake, and without attempting to predict
> how the role might be subdivided among them, this document refers to
> this collection of experts and organizations as the \"RFC
> Editor\".[¶](#section-1.1-2.1){.pilcrow}
>
> The RFC Editor is an expert technical editor and series editor, acting
> to support the mission of the RFC Series. As such, the RFC Editor is
> the implementer handling the editorial management of the RFC Series,
> in accordance with the defined processes. In addition, the RFC Editor
> is expected to be the expert and prime mover in discussions about
> policies for editing, publishing, and archiving
> RFCs.[¶](#section-1.1-2.2){.pilcrow}

RFC 8729 does not explore the internal organization of the RFC Editor.
However, RFC 8729 envisions changes in the RFC Editor organizational
structure. There have been several iterations on efforts to improve and
clarify this structure. These have been led by the IAB, in consultation
with the community and many leadership bodies within the community. This
first resulted in the publication of \[[RFC5620](#RFC5620){.xref}\] and
then in further discussions leading to the publication of
\[[RFC6635](#RFC6635){.xref}\]. Some of the details on this evolution
can be found below. In undertaking this evolution, the IAB considered
changes that increase flexibility and operational support options,
provide for the orderly succession of the RFC Editor, and ensure the
continuity of the RFC Series, while maintaining RFC quality, maintaining
timely processing, ensuring document accessibility, reducing costs, and
increasing cost transparency. The model set forth below describes the
internal organization of the RFC Editor, while remaining consistent with
RFC 8729.[¶](#section-1.1-3){.pilcrow}

Note that RFC 8729 uses the term \"RFC Editor function\" or \"RFC
Editor\" as the collective set of responsibilities for which this memo
provides a model for internal organization. This memo defines the term
\"RFC Series Editor\" or \"Series Editor\" for one of the organizational
components.[¶](#section-1.1-4){.pilcrow}

## [2.](#section-2){.section-number .selfRef} [RFC Editor Model](#name-rfc-editor-model){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-rfc-editor-model}

The RFC Editor model divides the responsibilities for the RFC Series
into the following components:[¶](#section-2-1){.pilcrow}

-   [RFC Series Editor
    (RSE)[¶](#section-2-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-2-2.1}
-   [RFC Production Center[¶](#section-2-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-2-2.2}
-   [RFC Publisher[¶](#section-2-2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-2-2.3}

The structure and relationship of the components of the RFC Series
production and process is schematically represented by [Figure
1](#model-figure){.xref}. The picture does not depict oversight and
escalation relations. It does include the streams and their managers
(which are not part of the RFC Series Editor, the RFC Production Center,
or Publisher facilities) in order to more fully show the context in
which the RFC Series Editor operates.[¶](#section-2-3){.pilcrow}

[Figure 1](#figure-1){.selfRef}: [Structure of RFC Series Production and
Process](#name-structure-of-rfc-series-pro){.selfRef}
:::

In this model, documents are produced and approved through multiple
document streams. The stream manager for each stream is responsible for
the content of that stream. The four streams that now exist are
described in \[[RFC8729](#RFC8729){.xref}\]. The RFC Editor function is
responsible for the packaging and distribution of the documents. As
such, documents from these streams are edited and processed by the
Production Center and published by the Publisher. The RFC Series Editor
will exercise strategic leadership and management over the activities of
the RFC Publisher and the RFC Production Center (both of which can be
seen as back-office functions) and will be the entity
that:[¶](#section-2-5){.pilcrow}

-   [Represents the RFC Series and the RFC Editor function within the
    IETF and externally.[¶](#section-2-6.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-2-6.1}

The RFC Series Editor is the individual with overall responsibility for
the quality, continuity, and evolution of the RFC

The RSE is appointed by the IAB, but formally hired by the IETF LLC. The
IAB delegates the direct oversight over the RSE to the RSOC, which it

With respect to the RFC Publisher and Production Center functions, the
RSE provides input to the IETF LLC budget, SOWs, and manages vendor
selection processes. The RSE performs annual reviews of the RFC
Production Center and Publisher function, which are then provided to the
RSOC, the IETF LLC, and the community. Normally, private financial
details would not be included in a public version unless the IETF LLC
concludes it is necessary to make such information
public.[¶](#section-2.1.1-1){.pilcrow}

The RSE is responsible for the performance of the RFC Production Center
and Publisher. The RSE is responsible for issues that go beyond the RFC
Production Center or Publisher functions, such as cross-stream
coordination of priorities. Issues that require changes to the budget or
contracts shall be brought to the attention of the IETF LLC by the
RSE.[¶](#section-2.1.1-2){.pilcrow}

The RSE is also responsible for creating documentation and structures
that will allow for continuity of the RFC Series in the face of changes
in contracts and personnel.[¶](#section-2.1.1-3){.pilcrow}

Vendor selection for the RFC Production Center and Publisher functions
is done in cooperation with the streams and under final authority of the
IETF LLC. Details on this process can be found in [Section

The RSE is the primary point of contact to the IETF on matters relating
to the RFC Series in general, or policy matters relating to specific
documents. Issues of practical details in the processing of specific
documents are generally worked through directly with the RFC Production
Center staff.[¶](#section-2.1.2.1-1){.pilcrow}

This includes providing suitable reports to the community at large,
providing email contact for policy questions and inputs, and enabling
and participating in suitable on-line forums for discussion of issues
related to the RFC Series.[¶](#section-2.1.2.1-2){.pilcrow}

Due to the history and nature of the interaction between the RSE and the
IETF, certain principles, described in the following subsections, must
be understood and adhered to by the RSE in his or her interactions with
the community. These apply to the representation function, as well as to
the leadership the RSE provides for production and series
development.[¶](#section-2.1.2.1-3){.pilcrow}

The vast majority of Internet technical community work is led,
initiated, and done by community volunteers, including oversight, policy
making, and direct production of, for example, many software tools. The
RSE, while not a volunteer, is dependent upon these volunteer
participants. Also, the spirit of the community is heavily focused on
and draws from these volunteers. As such, the RSE needs to support the
vitality and effectiveness of volunteer
participation.[¶](#section-2.1.2.1.1-1){.pilcrow}

###### [2.1.2.1.2.](#section-2.1.2.1.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Policy Authority](#name-policy-authority){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-policy-authority}

All decisions are to be made in the overall interest of the broader
Internet community. The RSE is responsible for identifying materially
concerned interest groups within the Internet community and reaching out
to them. Those interest groups include at least the IETF community, the
IRTF community, the network research community, and the network
operations community. Other interest groups might also be materially
interested.[¶](#section-2.1.2.1.2-1){.pilcrow}

The RSE must consult with the community on policy issues. The RSE works
with the community to achieve policy that meets the overall quality,
continuity, and evolution goals the RSE is charged with meeting. As
described in [Section 3.1](#RSOC){.xref}, the RSE reports the results of
such interactions to the RSOC, including a description of the outreach
efforts and the specific recommendations on policy. This enables the
RSOC to provide the oversight the IAB is required to apply, as well as
to confirm that the Internet community has been properly consulted and
considered in making policy.[¶](#section-2.1.2.1.2-2){.pilcrow}

need a contact person to talk to about the RFC Series. The RSE, or the
RSE\'s designate, serves this role.[¶](#section-2.1.2.2-1){.pilcrow}

Over time, the RSE should determine what, if any, means should be
employed to increase end-user awareness of the series, to reinforce the

Closely related to providing strategic leadership and management to the
RFC Production Center and Publisher functions is the need to develop and
improve those functions. The RSE is responsible for ensuring that such
ongoing development takes place.[¶](#section-2.1.3-1){.pilcrow}

This effort must include the dimensions of document quality, timeliness

In order to develop the RFC Series, the RSE is expected to develop a
relationship with the Internet technical community. The Editor is
expected to engage with the Internet technical community in a process of
articulating and refining a vision for the series and its continuous
evolution. The RSE is also expected to engage other users of the RFC
Series, in particular, the consumers of these documents, such as those
people who use them to specify products, write code, test behaviors, or
other related activities.[¶](#section-2.1.4-1){.pilcrow}

The RSOC will act with authority delegated from the IAB: in general, it
will be the RSOC that will approve consensus policy and vision documents
as developed by the RSE in collaboration with the community. While it is
expected that the IAB will exercise due diligence in its supervision of

iteration on this and related documents and evaluation of various
strategies and options. During the creation of what became

relationships evolve. The RSOC will include people who are not current
IAB members. Currently, this is aligned with the IAB program structure.
The IAB will designate the membership of the RSOC with the following
goals: preserving effective stability; keeping it small enough to be
effective, and keeping it large enough to provide general Internet
community expertise, specific IETF expertise, publication expertise, and
stream expertise. Members serve at the pleasure of the IAB and are
expected to bring a balance between short- and long-term perspectives.
Specific input about, and recommendations of, members will be sought
from the streams, the IETF LLC, and the
RSE.[¶](#section-3.1.1-1){.pilcrow}

In addition to the members from outside of the IAB appointed to the
RSOC, IAB members may participate as full members of the RSOC. Under
most circumstances, there will be a specific individual IAB member
appointed by the IAB as the program lead, who will be a full member of
the RSOC. This member\'s role is distinct from any RSOC-internal
organizational roles, such as would be created by the RSOC choosing to
appoint a chair from among its members. Other IAB members may choose to
be full members of the RSOC, with the consent of the IAB. This consent
is primarily concerned with avoiding overpopulating the RSOC and
providing it with relatively stable membership, which will work best if
it is not too large a committee.[¶](#section-3.1.1-2){.pilcrow}

The IETF LLC will appoint an individual to serve as its liaison to the
RSOC. The RSE and the IETF LLC Liaison will serve as non-voting ex
officio members of the RSOC. Either or both can be excluded from its
discussions if necessary.[¶](#section-3.1.1-3){.pilcrow}

As stated earlier, vendor selection is done in cooperation with the
streams and under the final authority of the IETF
LLC.[¶](#section-4.1-1){.pilcrow}

The RSE owns and develops the work definition (the SOW) and participates
in the IETF LLC vendor selection process. The work definition is created
within the IETF LLC budget and takes into account the stream managers
and community input.[¶](#section-4.1-2){.pilcrow}

The process to select and contract for an RFC Production Center, RFC
Publisher, and other RFC-related services, is as
follows:[¶](#section-4.1-3){.pilcrow}

-   [The IETF LLC establishes the contract process, including the steps
    necessary to issue an RFP when necessary, the timing, and the
    contracting
    procedures.[¶](#section-4.1-4.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.1-4.1}
-   [The IETF LLC establishes the Selection Committee, which will
    consist of the RSE, the IETF LLC Executive Director, and other
    members selected by the RSOC and the IETF LLC. The Committee shall
    be chaired by the
    RSE.[¶](#section-4.1-4.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.1-4.2}
-   [The Selection Committee selects the vendor, subject to the
    successful negotiation of a contract approved by the IETF LLC. In
    the event that a contract cannot be reached, the matter shall be
    referred to the Selection Committee for further
    action.[¶](#section-4.1-4.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.1-4.3}
-   [The Selection Committee may select an RFC Publisher either through
    the IETF LLC RFP process or, at the Committee\'s option, the
    Committee may select the IETF Secretariat to provide RFC Publisher
    services, subject to negotiations in accordance with the IETF LLC
    procedures.[¶](#section-4.1-4.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.1-4.4}
:::

::: {#section-4.2 .section}
### [4.2.](#section-4.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Budget](#name-budget){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-budget}

The expenses discussed in this document are not new expenses. They have
been and remain part of the IETF Administration Limited Liability
Company \[[RFC8711](#RFC8711){.xref}\]
budget.[¶](#section-4.2-1){.pilcrow}

The RFC Series portion of the IETF LLC budget shall include funding to
support the RSE, RFC Production Center, RFC Publisher, and the
Independent Stream.[¶](#section-4.2-2){.pilcrow}

The IETF LLC has the responsibility to approve the total RFC Editor
budget (and the authority to deny it). The RSE must work within the IETF
LLC budgetary process.[¶](#section-4.2-3){.pilcrow}

The RSE is responsible for managing the RFC Editor function to operate
within those budgets. If production needs change, the RSE is responsible
for working with the Production Center, and where appropriate, other RFC
Editor component institutions, relevant streams, and/or the RSOC to
determine what the correct response should be. If they agree that a
budgetary change is needed, that decision needs to be taken to the IETF
LLC.[¶](#section-4.2-4){.pilcrow}

### [4.3.](#section-4.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Disagreements among Entities Related to the RFC Editor](#name-disagreements-among-entitie){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-disagreements-among-entitie}

The RFC Series Editor and the RFC Production Center and Publisher
facilities work with the various streams to produce RFCs. Disagreements
may arise between these entities during the execution of the RFC Editor
operations. In particular, different streams may disagree with each
other, or disagree with the RFC Editor function. Potentially, even the
RSOC or the IETF LLC could find themselves in disagreement with some
aspect of the RFC Editor operations. Note that disagreements between an
author and the RFC Production Center are not cross-entity issues, and
they are to be resolved by the RSE, in accordance with the rest of this
document.[¶](#section-4.3-1){.pilcrow}

If such cross-entity disagreements arise, the community would generally
hope that they can be resolved politely and directly. However, this is
not always possible. At that point, any relevant party would first
formally request a review and reconsideration of the decision. If the
party still disagrees after the reconsideration, that party may ask the
RSE to decide or, especially if the RSE is involved, the party may ask
the IAB Chair (for a technical or procedural matter) to mediate or
appoint a mediator to aid in the discussions, although he or she not is
obligated to do so. All parties should work informally and in good faith
to reach a mutually agreeable conclusion. As noted below, any such
issues that involve contractual matters must be brought to the attention
of the IETF LLC. If the IAB Chair is asked to assist in resolving the
matter, the Chair may ask for advice or seek assistance from anyone the
Chair deems helpful. The Chair may also alert any appropriate
individuals or organizations to the existence of the
issue.[¶](#section-4.3-2){.pilcrow}

If such a conclusion is not possible through the above less formal
processes, then the matter must be registered with the RFC Series
Oversight Committee. The RSOC may choose to offer advice to the RSE or
more general advice to the parties involved and may ask the RSE to defer
a decision until it formulates its advice. However, if a timely decision
cannot be reached through discussion, mediation, and mutual agreement,
the RSE is expected to make whatever decisions are needed to ensure the
smooth operation of the RFC Editor function; those decisions are
final.[¶](#section-4.3-3){.pilcrow}

The RSE may make final decisions unilaterally only to assure the
functioning of the process, and only while there is an evaluation of
current policies to determine whether they are appropriately implemented
in the decision or need adjustment. In particular, it should be noted
that final decisions about the technical content of individual documents
are the exclusive responsibility of the stream approvers from which
those documents originate, as shown in the illustration in [Figure
1](#model-figure){.xref}.[¶](#section-4.3-4){.pilcrow}

If informal agreements cannot be reached, then formal RSOC review and
decision making may be required. If so, the RSE must present the issues
involved to the community so that the community is aware of the
situation. The RSE will then report the issue to the RSOC for formal
resolution by the RSOC with confirmation by the IAB in its oversight
capacity.[¶](#section-4.3-5){.pilcrow}

IAB and community discussion of any patterns of disputes are expected to
inform future changes to RFC Series policies, including possible updates
to this document.[¶](#section-4.3-6){.pilcrow}

### [4.4.](#section-4.4){.section-number .selfRef} [Issues with Contractual Impact](#name-issues-with-contractual-imp){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-issues-with-contractual-imp}

If a disagreement or decision has immediate or future contractual
consequences, it falls under \[[RFC8711](#RFC8711){.xref}\]. If this
happens, the RSE must identify the issue and provide advice to the IETF
LLC. Additionally, if the RSOC has also developed advice, it should
forward that advice to the IETF LLC.[¶](#section-4.4-1){.pilcrow}

The IETF LLC must notify the RSOC and IAB regarding the action it
concludes is required to resolve the issue based on its applicable
procedures and provisions in the relevant
contracts.[¶](#section-4.4-2){.pilcrow}

## [5.](#section-5){.section-number .selfRef} [IANA Considerations](#name-iana-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-iana-considerations}

This document defines several functions within the overall RFC Editor
structure, and it places the responsibility for coordination of registry
value assignments with the RFC Production Center. The IETF LLC will
facilitate the establishment of the relationship between the RFC
Production Center and IANA.[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

This document does not create a new registry nor does it register any
values in existing registries, and no IANA action is
required.[¶](#section-5-2){.pilcrow}
:::

::: {#section-6 .section}
## [6.](#section-6){.section-number .selfRef} [Security Considerations](#name-security-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-security-considerations}

The same security considerations as those in
\[[RFC8729](#RFC8729){.xref}\] apply. The processes for the publication
of documents must prevent the introduction of unapproved changes. Since
the RFC Editor maintains the index of publications, sufficient security
must be in place to prevent these published documents from being changed
by external parties. The archive of RFC documents, any source documents
needed to recreate the RFC documents, and any associated original
documents (such as lists of errata, tools, and, for some early items,
originals that are not machine readable) need to be secured against any
kind of data storage failure.[¶](#section-6-1){.pilcrow}

The IETF LLC should take these security considerations into account
during the implementation and enforcement of the RFC Editor component
contracts.[¶](#section-6-2){.pilcrow}
