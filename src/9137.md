# RFC 9137 {#rfcnum}

# Considerations for Cancellation of IETF Meetings {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

The IETF ordinarily holds three in-person meetings per year to discuss
issues and advance the Internet. However, various events can make a
planned in-person meeting infeasible. This document provides criteria to
aid the IETF Administration LLC (IETF LLC), the Internet Engineering
Steering Group (IESG), and the Chair of the Internet Research Task Force
(IRTF) in deciding to relocate, virtualize, postpone, or cancel an
in-person IETF meeting.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

Among the highlights of the IETF calendar are in-person general
meetings, which happen three times a year at various locations around
the world.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

Various major events may affect the suitability of a scheduled in-person
IETF meeting, though this may not be immediately obvious for some
events. Examples of such events include the
following:[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

-   [A meeting venue itself may unexpectedly close or otherwise be
    unable to meet IETF meeting requirements due to a health issue,
    legal violation, or other localized
    problem.[¶](#section-1-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-3.1}
-   [A natural disaster could degrade the travel and meeting
    infrastructure in a planned location and make it unethical to
    further burden that infrastructure with a
    meeting.[¶](#section-1-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-3.2}
-   [War, civil unrest, or a public health crisis could make a meeting
    unsafe and/or result in widespread national or corporate travel
    bans.[¶](#section-1-3.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-3.3}
-   [An economic crisis could sharply reduce resources available for
    travel, resulting in lower expected
    attendance.[¶](#section-1-3.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-3.4}
-   [Changes in visa policies or other unexpected governmental
    restrictions might make the venue inaccessible to numerous
    attendees.[¶](#section-1-3.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-3.5}

This document provides criteria to aid the IETF Administration LLC (IETF
LLC), the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG), and the Chair of
the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) in deciding to relocate,
virtualize, postpone, or cancel an in-person IETF
meeting.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

## [3.](#section-3){.section-number .selfRef} [Decision Criteria and Roles](#name-decision-criteria-and-roles){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-decision-criteria-and-roles}

The IETF LLC assesses whether an in-person meeting is logistically and
financially viable in light of events and assembles information about
various travel restrictions that might impact attendance. The IESG and
the Chair of the IRTF assess if the projected attendance is sufficient
for a viable in-person meeting.[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

::: {#ietf-llc}
::: {#section-3.1 .section}
### [3.1.](#section-3.1){.section-number .selfRef} [IETF LLC](#name-ietf-llc){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-ietf-llc}

The IETF LLC is responsible for assessing the suitability of a venue for
an IETF meeting and is responsible for any reassessment in response to a
major event that leaves the prior conclusion in doubt. If such an event
occurs more than fourteen weeks before the start of the scheduled
meeting, it is deemed a non-emergency situation. Later events, up to and
including the week of a meeting itself, are deemed emergency
situations.[¶](#section-3.1-1){.pilcrow}

In non-emergency situations, if the IETF LLC determines the scheduled
meeting clearly cannot proceed (e.g., the venue has permanently closed),
then it [MUST]{.bcp14} share the reason(s) with the community and
[MUST]{.bcp14} consult on its proposed remedy. In less clear cases, the
IETF LLC [SHOULD]{.bcp14} conduct a formal reassessment process that
includes:[¶](#section-3.1-2){.pilcrow}

-   [Consulting with the community on the timetable of the decision
    process.[¶](#section-3.1-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.1-3.1}
-   [Consulting with the community on criteria to assess the impact of
    new developments.[¶](#section-3.1-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.1-3.2}
-   [Publishing an assessment report and recommended
    remedy.[¶](#section-3.1-3.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.1-3.3}
-   [Seeking approval of the IESG and the Chair of the IRTF for the
    recommendation.[¶](#section-3.1-3.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.1-3.4}

In emergency situations, which lack the time for a consultation process,
this document provides criteria that have IETF consensus and that the
IETF LLC [MUST]{.bcp14} apply in its
assessment.[¶](#section-3.1-4){.pilcrow}

The IETF LLC will collect information about the likely impact to
in-person attendance of national travel advisories, national and
corporate travel bans, availability of transportation, quarantine
requirements, etc., and report the results to the IESG and the Chair of
the IRTF.[¶](#section-3.1-5){.pilcrow}

These criteria, some of which are derived from [Section
3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8718#section-3){.relref} of
\[[RFC8718](#RFC8718){.xref}\], apply to venues that are re-evaluated
due to an emergency:[¶](#section-3.1-6){.pilcrow}

-   [Local safety guidelines allow the venue and hotels to host a
    meeting with the expected number of participants and
    staff.[¶](#section-3.1-7.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.1-7.1}
-   [It is possible to provision Internet access to the venue that
    allows those attending in person to utilize the Internet for all
    their IETF, business, and day-to-day needs; in addition, there must
    be sufficient bandwidth and access for remote attendees. Provisions
    include, but are not limited to, native and unmodified IPv4 and IPv6
    connectivity and global reachability; there may be no additional
    limitation that would materially impact their Internet use. To
    ensure availability, it [MUST]{.bcp14} be possible to provision
    redundant paths to the
    Internet.[¶](#section-3.1-7.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.1-7.2}
-   [A reasonable number of food and drink establishments are open and
    available within walking distance to provide for the expected number
    of participants and
    staff.[¶](#section-3.1-7.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.1-7.3}
-   [Local health and public safety infrastructure expects to have
    adequate capacity to support an influx of visitors during the
    meeting week.[¶](#section-3.1-7.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.1-7.4}

Finally, the IETF LLC [MUST]{.bcp14} assess the impact on its own
operations, including:[¶](#section-3.1-8){.pilcrow}

-   [The number of critical support staff, contractors, and volunteers
    who can be at the
    venue.[¶](#section-3.1-9.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.1-9.1}
-   [The financial impact of continuing a meeting or implementing any of
    the possible
    remedies.[¶](#section-3.1-9.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.1-9.2}

The IETF LLC [SHOULD]{.bcp14} cancel an in-person meeting and explore
potential remedies if it judges a meeting to be logistically impossible
or inconsistent with its fiduciary
responsibilities.[¶](#section-3.1-10){.pilcrow}

In the event of considerations this document does not foresee, the IETF
LLC should protect the health and safety of attendees and staff, as well
as the fiscal health of the organization, with approval from the IESG
and the Chair of the IRTF. The IESG should pursue a later update of this
document.[¶](#section-3.1-11){.pilcrow}
:::

::: {#iesg-and-irtf-chair}

### [3.2.](#section-3.2){.section-number .selfRef} [The IESG and the Chair of the IRTF](#name-the-iesg-and-the-chair-of-t){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-the-iesg-and-the-chair-of-t}

If the IETF LLC assesses there are no fundamental logistical or
financial obstacles to holding a meeting in an emergency situation, the
IESG and the Chair of the IRTF assess if projected attendance is high
enough to achieve the benefit of an in-person meeting. The IESG and the
Chair of the IRTF [SHOULD]{.bcp14} cancel the in-person meeting if that
benefit is insufficient.[¶](#section-3.2-1){.pilcrow}

The IESG and the Chair of the IRTF are discouraged from relying on a
simple head count of expected meeting attendance. Even dramatically
smaller meetings with large remote participation may be successful. In
addition to the IETF LLC\'s estimate, the IESG and the Chair of the IRTF
might consider:[¶](#section-3.2-2){.pilcrow}

-   [Are many working groups and research groups largely unaffected by
    the restrictions, so that they can operate
    effectively?[¶](#section-3.2-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.2-3.1}
-   [Is there a critical mass of key personnel at most working group
    meetings to leverage the advantages of in-person meetings, even if
    many participants are
    remote?[¶](#section-3.2-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.2-3.2}

::: {#remedies}
::: {#section-4 .section}
## [4.](#section-4){.section-number .selfRef} [Remedies](#name-remedies){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-remedies}

If a meeting cannot be held at the scheduled time and place, the IETF
LLC, IESG, and Chair of the IRTF have several options. The remedies in
this section should be considered in light of four principles (presented
in no particular order):[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

-   [Hold the scheduled sessions of a meeting in some
    format.[¶](#section-4-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-4-2.1}
-   [Provide benefits of in-person interactions when
    possible.[¶](#section-4-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-4-2.2}
-   [Avoid exorbitant additional travel expenses due to last-minute
    flight changes, etc.[¶](#section-4-2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-4-2.3}
-   [Ensure sufficient time and resources to adequately prepare an
    alternative.[¶](#section-4-2.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-4-2.4}

The following remedies are listed in approximate declining order of
preference.[¶](#section-4-3){.pilcrow}

::: {#relocation}
::: {#section-4.1 .section}
### [4.1.](#section-4.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Relocation](#name-relocation){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-relocation}

For attendees, the least disruptive response is to retain the meeting
week but move it to a more-accessible venue. To the maximum extent
possible, this will be geographically close to the original venue. In
particular, the IETF LLC [SHOULD]{.bcp14} meet the criteria in
\[[RFC8718](#RFC8718){.xref}\] and
\[[RFC8719](#RFC8719){.xref}\].[¶](#section-4.1-1){.pilcrow}

Relocation that requires new air travel arrangements for attendees
[SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} occur less than one month prior to the start of the
meeting.[¶](#section-4.1-2){.pilcrow}
:::
:::

::: {#virtualization}
::: {#section-4.2 .section}
### [4.2.](#section-4.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Virtualization](#name-virtualization){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-virtualization}

The second option, and one that has fewer issues with venue
availability, is to make a meeting fully online. This requires different
IETF processes and logistical operations that are outside the scope of
this document.[¶](#section-4.2-1){.pilcrow}
:::
:::

::: {#postponement}
::: {#section-4.3 .section}
### [4.3.](#section-4.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Postponement](#name-postponement){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-postponement}

Although it is more disruptive to the schedules of participants, the
next best option is to delay a meeting until a specific date, at the
same venue, at which conditions are expected to improve. The new end
date of a meeting must be at least 30 days before the beginning of the
following IETF meeting, and a meeting [MUST]{.bcp14} begin no earlier
than 30 days after the postponement
announcement.[¶](#section-4.3-1){.pilcrow}

Due to scheduling constraints at the venue, this will usually not be
feasible. However, it is more likely to allow attendees to recover at
least some of their travel expenses than other
options.[¶](#section-4.3-2){.pilcrow}

Note that it is possible to both postpone and relocate a meeting, though
this has the disadvantages of both.[¶](#section-4.3-3){.pilcrow}
:::
:::

::: {#cancellation}
::: {#section-4.4 .section}
### [4.4.](#section-4.4){.section-number .selfRef} [Cancellation](#name-cancellation){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-cancellation}

The IETF LLC, IESG, and Chair of the IRTF may cancel a meeting entirely
in the event that worldwide conditions make it difficult for attendees
to even attend online. Not holding a meeting at all can have wide
implications, such as effects on the nomination process and seating of
new officers.[¶](#section-4.4-1){.pilcrow}

Cancellation is likely the only practical alternative when emergencies
occur immediately before or during a meeting, so that there is no
opportunity to make other arrangements.[¶](#section-4.4-2){.pilcrow}

::: {#refunds}
::: {#section-5 .section}
## [5.](#section-5){.section-number .selfRef} [Refunds](#name-refunds){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-refunds}

The IETF [SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} reimburse registered attendees for
unrecoverable travel expenses (airfare, hotel deposits,
etc.).[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

However, there are several cases where full or partial refund of
registration fees are appropriate:[¶](#section-5-2){.pilcrow}

-   [Cancellation [SHOULD]{.bcp14} result in a full refund to all
    participants. It [MAY]{.bcp14} be prorated if some portion of the
    sessions completed without
    incident.[¶](#section-5-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-5-3.1}
-   [Upon postponement, the IETF LLC [SHOULD]{.bcp14} offer refunds to
    registered attendees who claim they cannot attend at the newly
    scheduled time. Attendees can opt out of receiving a
    refund.[¶](#section-5-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-5-3.2}
-   [When a meeting is virtualized, the IETF LLC [MUST]{.bcp14} offer to
    refund registered attendees the difference between their paid
    registration fee and the equivalent fee for an online meeting. The
    IETF LLC [SHOULD]{.bcp14} offer refunds to registered attendees who
    do not wish to attend an online
    meeting.[¶](#section-5-3.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-5-3.3}
-   [The IETF LLC [SHOULD]{.bcp14} offer refunds to attendees whose
    government forbids, or has issued a safety advisory against, visits
    to the host venue, even if the in-person meeting will continue. It
    [SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} refund cancellations due to employer policy or
    personal risk
    assessments.[¶](#section-5-3.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-5-3.4}

These provisions intend to maintain trust between the IETF and its
participants. However, under extraordinary threats to the solvency of
the organization, the IETF LLC may suspend
them.[¶](#section-5-4){.pilcrow}
