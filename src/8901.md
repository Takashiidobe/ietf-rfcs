# Multi-Signer DNSSEC Models {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

Many enterprises today employ the service of multiple DNS providers to
distribute their authoritative DNS service. Deploying DNSSEC in such an
environment may present some challenges, depending on the configuration
and feature set in use. In particular, when each DNS provider
independently signs zone data with their own keys, additional
key-management mechanisms are necessary. This document presents
deployment models that accommodate this scenario and describes these
key-management requirements. These models do not require any changes to
the behavior of validating resolvers, nor do they impose the new
key-management requirements on authoritative servers not involved in
multi-signer configurations.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

Many enterprises today employ the service of multiple Domain Name System
(DNS) \[[RFC1034](#RFC1034){.xref}\] \[[RFC1035](#RFC1035){.xref}\]
providers to distribute their authoritative DNS service. This is
primarily done for redundancy and availability, and it allows the DNS
service to survive a complete, catastrophic failure of any single
provider. Additionally, enterprises or providers occasionally have
requirements that preclude standard zone-transfer techniques
\[[RFC1995](#RFC1995){.xref}\]\[[RFC5936](#RFC5936){.xref}\]: either
nonstandardized DNS features are in use that are incompatible with zone
transfer, or operationally a provider must be able to (re-)sign DNS
records using their own keys. This document outlines some possible
models of DNSSEC \[[RFC4033](#RFC4033){.xref}\]
\[[RFC4034](#RFC4034){.xref}\] \[[RFC4035](#RFC4035){.xref}\] deployment
in such an environment.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

This document assumes a reasonable level of familiarity with DNS
operations and protocol terms. Much of the terminology is explained in
further detail in [\"DNS Terminology\"](#RFC8499){.xref}
\[[RFC8499](#RFC8499){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

::: {#models}
::: {#section-2 .section}
## [2.](#section-2){.section-number .selfRef} [Deployment Models](#name-deployment-models){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-deployment-models}

If a zone owner can use standard zone-transfer techniques, then the
presence of multiple providers does not require modifications to the
normal deployment models. In these deployments, there is a single
signing entity (which may be the zone owner, one of the providers, or a
separate entity), while the providers act as secondary authoritative
servers for the zone.[¶](#section-2-1){.pilcrow}

Occasionally, however, standard zone-transfer techniques cannot be used.
This could be due to the use of nonstandard DNS features or the
operational requirements of a given provider (e.g., a provider that only
supports \"online signing\"). In these scenarios, the multiple providers
each act like primary servers, independently signing data received from
the zone owner and serving it to DNS queriers. This configuration
presents some novel challenges and
requirements.[¶](#section-2-2){.pilcrow}

::: {#multi-sign}
::: {#section-2.1 .section}
### [2.1.](#section-2.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Multiple-Signer Models](#name-multiple-signer-models){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-multiple-signer-models}

In this category of models, multiple providers each independently sign
and serve the same zone. The zone owner typically uses provider-specific
APIs to update zone content identically at each of the providers and
relies on the provider to perform signing of the data. A key requirement
here is to manage the contents of the DNSKEY and Delegation Signer (DS)
RRsets in such a way that validating resolvers always have a viable path
to authenticate the DNSSEC signature chain, no matter which provider is
queried. This requirement is achieved by having each provider import the
public Zone Signing Keys (ZSKs) of all other providers into their DNSKEY
RRsets.[¶](#section-2.1-1){.pilcrow}

These models can support DNSSEC even for the nonstandard features
mentioned previously, if the DNS providers have the capability of
signing the response data generated by those features. Since these
responses are often generated dynamically at query time, one method is
for the provider to perform online signing (also known as on-the-fly
signing). However, another possible approach is to precompute all the
possible response sets and associated signatures and then
algorithmically determine at query time which response set and signature
need to be returned.[¶](#section-2.1-2){.pilcrow}

In the models presented, the function of coordinating the DNSKEY or DS
RRset does not involve the providers communicating directly with each
other. Feedback from several commercial managed-DNS providers indicates
that they may be unlikely to directly communicate, since they typically
have a contractual relationship only with the zone owner. However, if
the parties involved are agreeable, it may be possible to devise a
protocol mechanism by which the providers directly communicate to share
keys. Details of such a protocol are deferred to a future specification
document, should there be interest.[¶](#section-2.1-3){.pilcrow}

In the descriptions below, the Key Signing Key (KSK) and Zone Signing
Key (ZSK) correspond to the definitions in
\[[RFC8499](#RFC8499){.xref}\], with the caveat that the KSK not only
signs the zone apex DNSKEY RRset but also serves as the Secure Entry
Point (SEP) into the zone.[¶](#section-2.1-4){.pilcrow}

## [3.](#section-3){.section-number .selfRef} [Validating Resolver Behavior](#name-validating-resolver-behavio){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-validating-resolver-behavio}

The central requirement for both of the [multiple-signer
models](#multi-sign){.xref} ([Section 2.1](#multi-sign){.xref}) is to
ensure that the ZSKs from all providers are present in each provider\'s
apex DNSKEY RRset and vouched for by either the single KSK (in Model 1)
or each provider\'s KSK (in Model 2.) If this is not done, the following
situation can arise (assuming two providers, A and
B):[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

-   [The validating resolver follows a referral (i.e., secure
    delegation) to the zone in
    question.[¶](#section-3-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-2.1}
-   [It retrieves the zone\'s DNSKEY RRset from one of Provider A\'s
    nameservers, authenticates it against the parent DS RRset, and
    caches it.[¶](#section-3-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-2.2}
-   [At some point in time, the resolver attempts to resolve a name in
    the zone while the DNSKEY RRset received from Provider A is still
    viable in its cache.[¶](#section-3-2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-2.3}
-   [It queries one of Provider B\'s nameservers to resolve the name and
    obtains a response that is signed by Provider B\'s ZSK, which it
    cannot authenticate because this ZSK is not present in its cached
    DNSKEY RRset for the zone that it received from Provider
    A.[¶](#section-3-2.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-2.4}
-   [The resolver will not accept this response. It may still be able to
    ultimately authenticate the name by querying other nameservers for
    the zone until it elicits a response from one of Provider A\'s
    nameservers. But it has incurred the penalty of additional round
    trips with other nameservers, with the corresponding latency and
    processing costs. The exact number of additional round trips depends
    on details of the resolver\'s nameserver-selection algorithm and the
    number of nameservers configured at Provider
    B.[¶](#section-3-2.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-2.5}
-   [It may also be the case that a resolver is unable to provide an
    authenticated response, because it gave up after a certain number of
    retries or a certain amount of delay; or it is possible that
    downstream clients of the resolver that originated the query timed
    out waiting for a
    response.[¶](#section-3-2.6){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-2.6}

Hence, it is important that the DNSKEY RRset at each provider is
maintained with the active ZSKs of all participating providers. This
ensures that resolvers can validate a response no matter which
provider\'s nameservers it came from.[¶](#section-3-3){.pilcrow}

Details of how the DNSKEY RRset itself is validated differ. In [Model
1](#model1){.xref} ([Section 2.1.1](#model1){.xref}), one unique KSK
managed by the zone owner signs an identical DNSKEY RRset deployed at
each provider, and the signed DS record in the parent zone refers to
this KSK. In [Model 2](#model2){.xref} ([Section
2.1.2](#model2){.xref}), each provider has a distinct KSK and signs the
DNSKEY RRset with it. The zone owner deploys a DS RRset at the parent
zone that contains multiple DS records, each referring to a distinct
provider\'s KSK. Hence, it does not matter which provider\'s nameservers
the resolver obtains the DNSKEY RRset from; the signed DS record in each
model can authenticate the associated KSK.[¶](#section-3-4){.pilcrow}

## [4.](#section-4){.section-number .selfRef} [Signing-Algorithm Considerations](#name-signing-algorithm-considera){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-signing-algorithm-considera}

DNS providers participating in multi-signer models need to use a common
DNSSEC signing algorithm (or a common set of algorithms if several are
in use). This is because the current specifications require that if
there are multiple algorithms in the DNSKEY RRset, then RRsets in the
zone need to be signed with at least one DNSKEY of each algorithm, as
described in \[[RFC4035](#RFC4035){.xref}\], [Section
2.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4035#section-2.2){.relref}. If
providers employ distinct signing algorithms, then this requirement
cannot be satisfied.[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

## [5.](#section-5){.section-number .selfRef} [Authenticated-Denial Considerations](#name-authenticated-denial-consid){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-authenticated-denial-consid}

Authenticated denial of existence enables a resolver to validate that a
record does not exist. For this purpose, an authoritative server
presents, in a response to the resolver, signed NSEC ([Section
3.1.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4035#section-3.1.3){.relref} of
\[[RFC4035](#RFC4035){.xref}\]) or NSEC3 ([Section
7.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5155#section-7.2){.relref} of
\[[RFC5155](#RFC5155){.xref}\]) records that provide cryptographic proof
of this nonexistence. The NSEC3 method enhances NSEC by providing
opt-out for signing insecure delegations and also adds limited
protection against zone-enumeration attacks.[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

An authoritative server response carrying records for authenticated
denial is always self-contained, and the receiving resolver doesn\'t
need to send additional queries to complete the proof of denial. For
this reason, no rollover is needed when switching between NSEC and NSEC3
for a signed zone.[¶](#section-5-2){.pilcrow}

Since authenticated-denial responses are self-contained, NSEC and NSEC3
can be used by different providers to serve the same zone. Doing so,
however, defeats the protection against zone enumeration provided by
NSEC3 (because an adversary can trivially enumerate the zone by just
querying the providers that employ NSEC). A better configuration
involves multiple providers using different authenticated
denial-of-existence mechanisms that all provide zone-enumeration
defense, such as precomputed NSEC3, [NSEC3 white lies](#RFC7129){.xref}
\[[RFC7129](#RFC7129){.xref}\], [NSEC black
lies](#I-D.valsorda-dnsop-black-lies){.xref}
\[[BLACKLIES](#I-D.valsorda-dnsop-black-lies){.xref}\], etc. Note,
however, that having multiple providers offering different
authenticated-denial mechanisms may impact how effectively resolvers are
able to make use of the caching of negative
responses.[¶](#section-5-3){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-5.1 .section}
### [5.1.](#section-5.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Single Method](#name-single-method){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-single-method}

Usually, the NSEC and NSEC3 methods are used exclusively (i.e., the
methods are not used at the same time by different servers). This
configuration is preferred, because the behavior is well defined and
closest to current operational practice.[¶](#section-5.1-1){.pilcrow}
:::

::: {#section-5.2 .section}
### [5.2.](#section-5.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Mixing Methods](#name-mixing-methods){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-mixing-methods}

Compliant resolvers should be able to validate zone data when different
authoritative servers for the same zone respond with different
authenticated-denial methods, because this is normally observed when
NSEC and NSEC3 are being switched or when NSEC3PARAM is
updated.[¶](#section-5.2-1){.pilcrow}

Resolver software may, however, be designed to handle a single
transition between two authenticated denial configurations more
optimally than a permanent setup with mixed authenticated-denial
methods. This could make caching on the resolver side less efficient,
and the authoritative servers may observe a higher number of queries.
This aspect should be considered especially in the context of
[\"Aggressive Use of DNSSEC-Validated Cache\"](#RFC8198){.xref}
\[[RFC8198](#RFC8198){.xref}\].[¶](#section-5.2-2){.pilcrow}

In case all providers cannot be configured with the same
authenticated-denial mechanism, it is recommended to limit the distinct
configurations to the lowest number
feasible.[¶](#section-5.2-3){.pilcrow}

Note that NSEC3 configuration on all providers with different NSEC3PARAM
values is considered a mixed setup.[¶](#section-5.2-4){.pilcrow}

## [6.](#section-6){.section-number .selfRef} [Key Rollover Considerations](#name-key-rollover-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-key-rollover-considerations}

The [multiple-signer](#multi-sign){.xref} ([Section
2.1](#multi-sign){.xref}) models introduce some new requirements for
DNSSEC key rollovers. Since this process necessarily involves
coordinated actions on the part of providers and the zone owner, one
reasonable strategy is for the zone owner to initiate key-rollover
operations. But other operationally plausible models may also suit, such
as a DNS provider initiating a key rollover and signaling their intent
to the zone owner in some manner. The mechanism to communicate this
intent could be some secure out-of-band channel that has been agreed
upon, or the provider could offer an API function that could be
periodically polled by the zone owner.[¶](#section-6-1){.pilcrow}

For simplicity, the descriptions in this section assume two DNS
providers. They also assume that KSK rollovers employ the commonly used
Double-Signature KSK rollover method and that ZSK rollovers employ the
Pre-Publish ZSK rollover method, as described in detail in
\[[RFC6781](#RFC6781){.xref}\]. With minor modifications, they can be
easily adapted to other models, such as Double-DS KSK rollover or
Double-Signature ZSK rollover, if desired. Key-use timing should follow
the recommendations outlined in \[[RFC6781](#RFC6781){.xref}\], but
taking into account the additional operations needed by the multi-signer
models. For example, \"time to propagate data to all the authoritative
servers\" now includes the time to import the new ZSKs into each
provider.[¶](#section-6-2){.pilcrow}

-   [Key Signing Key Rollover: In this model, the two managed-DNS
    providers share a common KSK (public key) in their respective zones,
    and the zone owner has sole access to the private key portion of the
    KSK. To initiate the rollover, the zone owner generates a new KSK
    and obtains the DNSKEY RRset of each DNS provider using their
    respective APIs. The new KSK is added to each provider\'s DNSKEY
    RRset, and the RRset is re-signed with both the new and the old KSK.
    This new DNSKEY RRset is then transferred to each provider. The zone
    owner then updates the DS RRset in the parent zone to point to the
    new KSK and, after the necessary DS record TTL period has expired,
    proceeds with updating the DNSKEY RRset to remove the old
    KSK.[¶](#section-6.1-1.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.1-1.1}
-   [Zone Signing Key Rollover: In this model, each DNS provider has
    separate Zone Signing Keys. Each provider can choose to roll their
    ZSK independently by coordinating with the zone owner. Provider A
    would generate a new ZSK and communicate their intent to perform a
    rollover (note that Provider A cannot immediately insert this new
    ZSK into their DNSKEY RRset, because the RRset has to be signed by
    the zone owner). The zone owner obtains the new ZSK from Provider A.
    It then obtains the current DNSKEY RRset from each provider
    (including Provider A), inserts the new ZSK into each DNSKEY RRset,
    re-signs the DNSKEY RRset, and sends it back to each provider for
    deployment via their respective key-management APIs. Once the
    necessary time period has elapsed (i.e., all zone data has been
    re-signed by the new ZSK and propagated to all authoritative servers
    for the zone, plus the maximum zone-TTL value of any of the data in
    the zone that has been signed by the old ZSK), Provider A and the
    zone owner can initiate the next phase of removing the old ZSK and
    re-signing the resulting new DNSKEY
    RRset.[¶](#section-6.1-1.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.1-1.2}

-   [Key Signing Key Rollover: In Model 2, each managed-DNS provider has
    their own KSK. A KSK roll for Provider A does not require any change
    in the DNSKEY RRset of Provider B but does require co-ordination
    with the zone owner in order to get the DS record set in the parent
    zone updated. The KSK roll starts with Provider A generating a new
    KSK and including it in their DNSKEY RRSet. The DNSKey RRset would
    then be signed by both the new and old KSK. The new KSK is
    communicated to the zone owner, after which the zone owner updates
    the DS RRset to replace the DS record for the old KSK with a DS
    record for the new KSK. After the necessary DS RRset TTL period has
    elapsed, the old KSK can be removed from Provider A\'s DNSKEY
    RRset.[¶](#section-6.2-1.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.2-1.1}

    re-signing the new DNSKEY RRset with their KSK. The new ZSK of
    Provider A would then be communicated to the zone owner, who would
    initiate the process of importing this ZSK into the DNSKEY RRsets of
    the other providers, using their respective APIs. Before signing
    zone data with the new ZSK, Provider A should wait for the DNSKEY
    TTL plus the time to import the ZSK into Provider B, plus the time
    to propagate the DNSKEY RRset to all authoritative servers of both
    providers. Once the necessary Pre-Publish key-rollover time periods
    have elapsed, Provider A and the zone owner can initiate the process
    of removing the old ZSK from the DNSKEY RRsets of all

## [7.](#section-7){.section-number .selfRef} [Using Combined Signing Keys](#name-using-combined-signing-keys){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-using-combined-signing-keys}

A Combined Signing Key (CSK) is one in which the same key serves the
purposes of both being the secure entry point (SEP) key for the zone and
signing all the zone data, including the DNSKEY RRset (i.e., there is no
KSK/ZSK split).[¶](#section-7-1){.pilcrow}

Model 1 is not compatible with CSKs because the zone owner would then
hold the sole signing key, and providers would not be able to sign their
own zone data.[¶](#section-7-2){.pilcrow}

Model 2 can accommodate CSKs without issue. In this case, any or all of
the providers could employ a CSK. The DS record in the parent zone would
reference the provider\'s CSK instead of KSK, and the public CSK would
need to be imported into the DNSKEY RRsets of all of the other
providers. A CSK key rollover for such a provider would involve the
following: The provider generates a new CSK, installs the new CSK into
the DNSKEY RRset, and signs it with both the old and new CSKs. The new
CSK is communicated to the zone owner. The zone owner exports this CSK
into the other provider\'s DNSKEY RRsets and replaces the DS record
referencing the old CSK with one referencing the new one in the parent
DS RRset. Once all the zone data has been re-signed with the new CSK,
the old CSK is removed from the DNSKEY RRset, and the latter is
re-signed with only the new CSK. Finally, the old CSK is removed from
the DNSKEY RRsets of the other providers.[¶](#section-7-3){.pilcrow}

CDS and CDNSKEY records
\[[RFC7344](#RFC7344){.xref}\]\[[RFC8078](#RFC8078){.xref}\] are used to
facilitate automated updates of DNSSEC secure-entry-point keys between
parent and child zones. Multi-signer DNSSEC configurations can support
this, too. In Model 1, CDS/CDNSKEY changes are centralized at the zone
owner. However, the zone owner will still need to push down updated
signed CDNS/DNSKEY RRsets to the providers via the key-management
mechanism. In Model 2, the key-management mechanism needs to support
cross-importation of the CDS/CDNSKEY records, so that a common view of
the RRset can be constructed at each provider and is visible to the
parent zone attempting to update the DS
RRset.[¶](#section-8-1){.pilcrow}

Managed-DNS providers typically have their own proprietary zone
configuration and data-management APIs, commonly utilizing HTTPS and
Representational State Transfer (REST) interfaces. So, rather than
outlining a new API for key management here, we describe the specific
functions that the provider API needs to support in order to enable the
multi-signer models. The zone owner is expected to use these API
functions to perform key-management tasks. Other mechanisms that can
partly offer these functions, if supported by the providers, include the
[DNS UPDATE protocol](#RFC2136){.xref} \[[RFC2136](#RFC2136){.xref}\]
and [Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP)](#RFC5731){.xref}

In Model 2, once initially bootstrapped with each other\'s zone-signing
keys via these API mechanisms, providers could, if desired, periodically
query each other\'s DNSKEY RRsets, authenticate their signatures, and
automatically import or withdraw ZSKs in the keyset as key-rollover
events happen.[¶](#section-9-3){.pilcrow}

## [10.](#section-10){.section-number .selfRef} [DNS Response-Size Considerations](#name-dns-response-size-considera){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-dns-response-size-considera}

The multi-signer models result in larger DNSKEY RRsets, so the size of a
response to a query for the DNSKEY RRset will be larger. The actual size
increase depends on multiple factors: DNSKEY algorithm and keysize
choices, the number of providers, whether additional keys are
prepublished, how many simultaneous key rollovers are in progress, etc.
Newer elliptic-curve algorithms produce keys small enough that the
responses will typically be far below the common Internet-path MTU.
Thus, operational concerns related to IP fragmentation or truncation and
TCP fallback are unlikely to be encountered. In any case, DNS operators
need to ensure that they can emit and process large DNS UDP responses
when necessary, and a future migration to alternative transports like
[DNS over TLS](#RFC7858){.xref} \[[RFC7858](#RFC7858){.xref}\] or [DNS
over HTTPS](#RFC8484){.xref} \[[RFC8484](#RFC8484){.xref}\] may make

The multi-signer models necessarily involve third-party providers
holding the private keys that sign the zone-owner\'s data. Obviously,
this means that the zone owner has decided to place a great deal of
trust in these providers. By contrast, the more traditional model in
which the zone owner runs a hidden master and uses the zone-transfer
protocol with the providers is arguably more secure, because only the
zone owner holds the private signing keys, and the third-party providers
cannot serve bogus data without detection by validating
resolvers.[¶](#section-12-1){.pilcrow}

The zone-key import and export APIs required by these models need to be
strongly authenticated to prevent tampering of key material by malicious
third parties. Many providers today offer REST/HTTPS APIs that utilize a
number of client-authentication mechanisms (username/password, API keys
etc) and whose HTTPS layer provides transport security and server
authentication. Multifactor authentication could be used to further
strengthen security. If DNS protocol mechanisms like UPDATE are being
used for key insertion and deletion, they should similarly be strongly
authenticated \-- e.g., by employing [Transaction Signatures
(TSIG)](#RFC2845){.xref} \[[RFC2845](#RFC2845){.xref}\]. Key generation
and other general security-related operations should follow the guidance
specified in \[[RFC6781](#RFC6781){.xref}\].[¶](#section-12-2){.pilcrow}
