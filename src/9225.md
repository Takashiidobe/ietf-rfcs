# Software Defects Considered Harmful {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

This document discourages the practice of introducing software defects
in general and in network protocol implementations specifically.
Software defects are one of the largest cost drivers for the networking
industry. This document is intended to clarify the best current practice
in this regard.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

Software defects (informally known as \"bugs\") have been the cause and
effect of innumerable system degradations and failures over the years.
Bugs are errors, flaws, or faults in a computer program that cause the
program to produce an incorrect or unexpected
result.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

(Please note: unexpected results caused by bugs are not a valid
substitute for high-quality random number generators, though
high-quality random number generators are generally not considered to be
bugs.)[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

Endeavoring to reduce the number of degradations in the future,
implementers [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} introduce bugs when writing software.
This document outlines why bugs are considered harmful and proposes a
set of recommendations.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

## [3.](#section-3){.section-number .selfRef} [Examples of High-Impact Software Defects](#name-examples-of-high-impact-sof){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-examples-of-high-impact-sof}

In June 1996, the European Space Agency \[[ARIANE](#ARIANE){.xref}\]
launched an unmanned rocket \-- costing several billion dollars in
development \-- only to see it go \[[KABOOM](#KABOOM){.xref}\] 40
seconds after takeoff. A software exception had occurred during the
execution of a data conversion from 64-bit floating point to 16-bit
signed integer value. The floating point number that was converted had a
value greater than what could be represented by a 16-bit signed integer.
The vehicle probably would not have disintegrated if the defect had not
been written into the software.[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

As an example of the detrimental effects of bugs in physically hard to
reach systems: the \[[NASA](#NASA){.xref}\] Deep Impact spacecraft
\[[DEEPIMPACT](#DEEPIMPACT){.xref}\] was rendered inoperable due to a
fault in the fault-protection software, which in turn triggered endless
computer reboots. Mission control was unable to recover the system from
this error condition because no engineers were available on-site. The
commute was deemed infeasible due to a lack of reasonably priced
commercial transport options in that region of the solar
system.[¶](#section-3-2){.pilcrow}

In 1983, the Soviet Union\'s Early Warning Satellite System
\[[Serpukhov](#Serpukhov){.xref}\] announced it had detected a possible
missile launch originating in the US; fortunately, a human operator
recognized this as a likely system failure. Indeed, a retrospective
analysis suggested the software had misclassified reflections from cloud
cover as missile launch blooms. With this bug, the software held the
potential to trigger a cascading sequence of events that could\'ve led
to the start of a planetary-scale war. Seemingly innocuous software
defects can have outsized impact, and sometimes it pays off to simply do
nothing and wait.[¶](#section-3-3){.pilcrow}

The US Department of Commerce\'s National Institute of Standards and
Technology \[[NIST](#NIST){.xref}\] commissioned a study to develop a
deeper understanding of the prevalence of software defects and their
cost to society. The study estimated about 0.6 percent of the gross
domestic product is squandered due to programming bugs. Each person
works approximately one hour a week to compensate for this debt \-- an
hour that could\'ve been spent in leisure \-- in addition to any time
spent on the direct consequences of buggy
software.[¶](#section-3-4){.pilcrow}

The universal deployment of IP networks on [Avian
Carriers](#RFC1149){.xref} \[[RFC1149](#RFC1149){.xref}\] is facing a
multi-decade delay. After operators discovered that birds are not real
(now \[[confirmed](#confirmed){.xref}\] by the US Government), work
began to first understand the many \[[quirks](#quirks){.xref}\] of the
drones\' firmware before proceeding with wider-scale deployment. No
clear timelines exist at this point in time.[¶](#section-3-5){.pilcrow}

For more examples, consult the RISKS Digest \[[RISKS](#RISKS){.xref}\]:
it documents a multitude of examples of defects in technological
infrastructure and their risk to society. Unsupervised study of the
Digest archive may induce a sense of panic.[¶](#section-3-6){.pilcrow}

3.  [When implementing specifications that are broken by design, it is
    [RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14} to aggregate multiple smaller bugs into one
    larger bug. This will be easier to document: rather than having a
    lot of hard-to-track inconsequential bugs, there will be only a few
    easy-to-recognise significant

## [5.](#section-5){.section-number .selfRef} [Security Considerations](#name-security-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-security-considerations}

With the production of fewer bugs, there will necessarily be fewer
security impacts. To improve the collective security posture, a thorough
review of ALL existing software to find any remaining bugs is
[RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14}.[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

As it is assumed that there is an even distribution of bugs through all
software, it is safe to consider any piece of software to be bug free
once a certain number of bugs have been
found.[¶](#section-5-2){.pilcrow}

Some philosophers argue in defense of an obviously wrong contrary view
that bugs introduce a certain amount of unpredictable variance in
behaviour, which in turn could serve to increase security. Such heretics
might even go one step further and celebrate the existence of bugs,
shielding issues from public scrutiny. However, it
\[[ostensibly](#ostensibly){.xref}\] is in society\'s best interest to
fully disclose any and all bugs as soon as they are
discovered.[¶](#section-5-3){.pilcrow}

The existence of this very document of course begs the question: what
are software defects, truly? Do bugs happen for a purpose? Is what we
perceive as the concept of bugs an indication for a wider issue in the
natural world? Do mistakes happen in other domains? Are they evidence of
a superior software architect?[¶](#appendix-A-1){.pilcrow}

An interdisciplinary approach to understand mistakes might be an area of
further study for the \[[IRTF](#IRTF){.xref}\]. It may very well turn
out that mistakes are provably detrimental in all domains; however, the
authors do not feel qualified to make any statements in this regard.
Once made aware of the above thesis, research-oriented interest groups
could perhaps take on the task of disproving Goedel\'s [incompleteness
theorem](#incomplete){.xref} \[[incomplete](#incomplete){.xref}\], and
in doing so, put an end to all bugs.[¶](#appendix-A-2){.pilcrow}
