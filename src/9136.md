# RFC 9136 {#rfcnum}

# IP Prefix Advertisement in Ethernet VPN (EVPN) {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

The BGP MPLS-based Ethernet VPN (EVPN) (RFC 7432) mechanism provides a
flexible control plane that allows intra-subnet connectivity in an MPLS
and/or Network Virtualization Overlay (NVO) (RFC 7365) network. In some
networks, there is also a need for dynamic and efficient inter-subnet
connectivity across Tenant Systems and end devices that can be physical
or virtual and do not necessarily participate in dynamic routing
protocols. This document defines a new EVPN route type for the
advertisement of IP prefixes and explains some use-case examples where
this new route type is used.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC7365](#RFC7365){.xref}\] provides a framework for Data Center (DC)
Network Virtualization over Layer 3 and specifies that the Network
Virtualization Edge (NVE) devices must provide Layer 2 and Layer 3
virtualized network services in multi-tenant DCs.
\[[RFC8365](#RFC8365){.xref}\] discusses the use of EVPN as the
technology of choice to provide Layer 2 or intra-subnet services in
these DCs. This document, along with \[[RFC9135](#RFC9135){.xref}\],
specifies the use of EVPN for Layer 3 or inter-subnet connectivity
services.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC9135](#RFC9135){.xref}\] defines some fairly common inter-subnet
forwarding scenarios where Tenant Systems (TSs) can exchange packets
with TSs located in remote subnets. In order to achieve this,
\[[RFC9135](#RFC9135){.xref}\] describes how Media Access Control (MAC)
and IPs encoded in TS RT-2 routes are not only used to populate MAC
Virtual Routing and Forwarding (MAC-VRF) and overlay Address Resolution
Protocol (ARP) tables but also IP-VRF tables with the encoded TS host
routes (/32 or /128). In some cases, EVPN may advertise IP prefixes and
therefore provide aggregation in the IP-VRF tables, as opposed to
propagating individual host routes. This document complements the
scenarios described in \[[RFC9135](#RFC9135){.xref}\] and defines how
EVPN may be used to advertise IP prefixes. Interoperability between EVPN
and Layer 3 Virtual Private Network (VPN) \[[RFC4364](#RFC4364){.xref}\]
IP Prefix routes is out of the scope of this
document.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

[Section 2.1](#sect-2.1){.xref} describes the inter-subnet connectivity
requirements in DCs. [Section 2.2](#sect-2.2){.xref} explains why a new
EVPN route type is required for IP prefix advertisements. Sections
[3](#sect-3){.xref}, [4](#sect-4){.xref}, and [5](#sect-5){.xref} will
describe this route type and how it is used in some specific use
cases.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

The following considerations apply to TSs that are physical or virtual
systems identified by MAC (and possibly IP addresses) and are connected
to BDs by Attachment Circuits:[¶](#section-2.1-2){.pilcrow}

-   [The Tenant Systems may be VMs that generate traffic from their own
    MAC and IP.[¶](#section-2.1-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.1-3.1}

-   ::: {#section-2.1-3.2}
    The Tenant Systems may be VA entities that forward traffic to/from
    IP addresses of different end devices sitting behind
    them.[¶](#section-2.1-3.2.1){.pilcrow}

    -   [These VAs can be firewalls, load balancers, NAT devices, other
        appliances, or virtual gateways with virtual routing
        instances.[¶](#section-2.1-3.2.2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.1-3.2.2.1}
    -   [These VAs do not necessarily participate in dynamic routing
        protocols and hence rely on the EVPN NVEs to advertise the
        routes on their
        behalf.[¶](#section-2.1-3.2.2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.1-3.2.2.2}
    -   [In all these cases, the VA will forward traffic to other TSs
        using its own source MAC, but the source IP will be the one
        associated with the end device sitting behind the VA or a
        translated IP address (part of a public NAT pool) if the VA is
        performing
        NAT.[¶](#section-2.1-3.2.2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.1-3.2.2.3}
    -   [Note that the same IP address and endpoint could exist behind
        two of these TSs. One example of this would be certain appliance
        resiliency mechanisms, where a virtual IP or floating IP can be
        owned by one of the two VAs running the resiliency protocol (the
        Master VA). The Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP)
        \[[RFC5798](#RFC5798){.xref}\] is one particular example of
        this. Another example is multihomed subnets, i.e., the same
        subnet is connected to two
        VAs.[¶](#section-2.1-3.2.2.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.1-3.2.2.4}
    -   [Although these VAs provide IP connectivity to VMs and the
        subnets behind them, they do not always have their own IP
        interface connected to the EVPN NVE; Layer 2 firewalls are
        examples of VAs not supporting IP
        interfaces.[¶](#section-2.1-3.2.2.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.1-3.2.2.5}

Where:[¶](#section-2.1-6){.pilcrow}

NVE1, NVE2, NVE3, NVE4, NVE5, DGW1, and DGW2 share the same BD for a
particular tenant. BD-10 is comprised of the collection of BD instances
defined in all the NVEs. All the hosts connected to BD-10 belong to the
same IP subnet. The hosts connected to BD-10 are listed
below:[¶](#section-2.1-7){.pilcrow}

-   [TS1 is a VM that generates/receives traffic to/from IP1, where IP1
    belongs to the BD-10
    subnet.[¶](#section-2.1-8.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.1-8.1}
-   [TS2 and TS3 are VAs that send/receive traffic to/from the subnets
    and hosts sitting behind them (SN1, SN2, SN3, IP4, and IP5). Their
    IP addresses (IP2 and IP3) belong to the BD-10 subnet, and they can
    also generate/receive traffic. When these VAs receive packets
    destined to their own MAC addresses (M2 and M3), they will route the
    packets to the proper subnet or host. These VAs do not support
    routing protocols to advertise the subnets connected to them and can
    move to a different server and NVE when the cloud management system
    decides to do so. These VAs may also support redundancy mechanisms
    for some subnets, similar to VRRP, where a floating IP is owned by
    the Master VA and only the Master VA forwards traffic to a given
    subnet. For example, vIP23 in [Figure 1](#fig-1){.xref} is a
    floating IP that can be owned by TS2 or TS3 depending on which
    system is the Master. Only the Master will forward traffic to
    SN1.[¶](#section-2.1-8.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.1-8.2}
-   [Integrated Routing and Bridging interfaces IRB1, IRB2, and IRB3
    have their own IP addresses that belong to the BD-10 subnet too.
    These IRB interfaces connect the BD-10 subnet to Virtual Routing and
    Forwarding (IP-VRF) instances that can route the traffic to other
    subnets for the same tenant (within the DC or at the other end of
    the WAN).[¶](#section-2.1-8.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.1-8.3}
-   [TS4 is a Layer 2 VA that provides connectivity to subnets SN5, SN6,
    and SN7 but does not have an IP address itself in the BD-10. TS4 is
    connected to a port on NVE5 that is assigned to Ethernet Segment
    Identifier 4
    (ESI4).[¶](#section-2.1-8.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.1-8.4}

For a BD to which an ingress NVE is attached, \"Overlay Index\" is
defined as an identifier that the ingress EVPN NVE requires in order to
forward packets to a subnet or host in a remote subnet. As an example,
vIP23 ([Figure 1](#fig-1){.xref}) is an Overlay Index that any NVE
attached to BD-10 needs to know in order to forward packets to SN1. The
IRB3 IP address is an Overlay Index required to get to SN4, and ESI4 is
an Overlay Index needed to forward traffic to SN5. In other words, the
Overlay Index is a next hop in the overlay address space that can be an
IP address, a MAC address, or an ESI. When advertised along with an IP
prefix, the Overlay Index requires a recursive resolution to find out
the egress NVE to which the EVPN packets need to be
sent.[¶](#section-2.1-9){.pilcrow}

All the DC use cases in [Figure 1](#fig-1){.xref} require inter-subnet
forwarding; therefore, the individual host routes and
subnets:[¶](#section-2.1-10){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC7432](#RFC7432){.xref}\] defines a MAC/IP Advertisement route
(also referred to as \"RT-2\") where a MAC address can be advertised
together with an IP address length and IP address (IP). While a variable
IP address length might have been used to indicate the presence of an IP
prefix in a route type 2, there are several specific use cases in which
using this route type to deliver IP prefixes is not
suitable.[¶](#section-2.2-1){.pilcrow}

One example of such use cases is the \"floating IP\" example described
in [Section 2.1](#sect-2.1){.xref}. In this example, it is necessary to
decouple the advertisement of the prefixes from the advertisement of a
MAC address of either M2 or M3; otherwise, the solution gets highly
inefficient and does not scale.[¶](#section-2.2-2){.pilcrow}

For example, if 1,000 prefixes are advertised from M2 (using RT-2) and
the floating IP owner changes from M2 to M3, 1,000 routes would be
withdrawn by M2 and readvertised by M3. However, if a separate route
type is used, 1,000 routes can be advertised as associated with the
floating IP address (vIP23), and only one RT-2 can be used for
advertising the ownership of the floating IP, i.e., vIP23 and M2 in the
route type 2. When the floating IP owner changes from M2 to M3, a single
RT-2 withdrawal/update is required to indicate the change. The remote
DGW will not change any of the 1,000 prefixes associated with vIP23 but
will only update the ARP resolution entry for vIP23 (now pointing at
M3).[¶](#section-2.2-3){.pilcrow}

An EVPN route (type 5) for the advertisement of IP prefixes is described
in this document. This new route type has a differentiated role from the
RT-2 route and addresses the inter-subnet connectivity scenarios for DCs
(or NVO-based networks in general) described in this document. Using
this new RT-5, an IP prefix may be advertised along with an Overlay
Index, which can be a GW IP address, a MAC, or an ESI. The IP prefix may
also be advertised without an Overlay Index, in which case the BGP next
hop will point at the egress NVE, Area Border Router (ABR), or ASBR, and
the MAC in the EVPN Router\'s MAC Extended Community will provide the
inner MAC destination address to be used. As discussed throughout the
document, the EVPN RT-2 does not meet the requirements for all the DC
use cases; therefore, this EVPN route type 5 is
required.[¶](#section-2.2-4){.pilcrow}

The EVPN route type 5 decouples the IP prefix advertisements from the
MAC/IP Advertisement routes in EVPN. Hence:[¶](#section-2.2-5){.pilcrow}

Overlay Indexes as follows:[¶](#section-3.2-1){.pilcrow}

-   [An Overlay Index can be an ESI or IP address in the address space
    of the tenant or MAC address, and it is used by an NVE as the next
    hop for a given IP prefix. An Overlay Index always needs a recursive
    route resolution on the NVE/PE that installs the RT-5 into one of
    its IP-VRFs so that the NVE knows to which egress NVE/PE it needs to
    forward the packets. It is important to note that recursive
    resolution of the Overlay Index applies upon installation into an
    IP-VRF and not upon BGP propagation (for instance, on an ASBR).
    Also, as a result of the recursive resolution, the egress NVE/PE is
    not necessarily the same NVE that originated the
    RT-5.[¶](#section-3.2-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.2-2.1}

-   [The Overlay Index is indicated along with the RT-5 in the ESI
    field, GW IP field, or EVPN Router\'s MAC Extended Community,
    depending on whether the IP prefix next hop is an ESI, an IP
    address, or a MAC address in the tenant space. The Overlay Index for
    a given IP prefix is set by local policy at the NVE that originates

Case](#name-ts-ip-address-use-case){.selfRef}
:::

An example of inter-subnet forwarding between subnet SN1, which uses a
24-bit IP prefix (written as SN1/24 in the future), and a subnet sitting
in the WAN is described below. NVE2, NVE3, DGW1, and DGW2 are running
BGP EVPN. TS2 and TS3 do not participate in dynamic routing protocols,
and they only have a static route to forward the traffic to the WAN.
SN1/24 is dual-homed to NVE2 and NVE3.[¶](#section-4.1-3){.pilcrow}

In this case, a GW IP is used as an Overlay Index. Although a different
Overlay Index type could have been used, this use case assumes that the
operator knows the VA\'s IP addresses beforehand, whereas the VA\'s MAC
address is unknown and the VA\'s ESI is zero. Because of this, the GW IP
is the suitable Overlay Index to be used with the RT-5s. The NVEs know
the GW IP to be used for a given prefix by
policy.[¶](#section-4.1-4){.pilcrow}

Since TS2 and TS3 cannot participate in any dynamic routing protocol and
neither has an IP address assigned, there are two potential Overlay
Index types that can be used when advertising
SN1:[¶](#section-4.3-3){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

a\)
:   an ESI, i.e., ESI23, that can be provisioned on the attachment ports
    of NVE2 and NVE3, as shown in [Figure 7](#fig-4){.xref}
    or[¶](#section-4.3-4.1){.pilcrow}
:   

b\)
:   the VA\'s MAC address, which can be added to NVE2 and NVE3 by
    policy.[¶](#section-4.3-4.2){.pilcrow}
:   

The advantage of using an ESI as the Overlay Index as opposed to the
VA\'s MAC address is that the forwarding to the egress NVE can be done
purely based on the state of the AC in the Ethernet segment (notified by
the Ethernet A-D per EVI route), and all the EVPN multihoming redundancy
mechanisms can be reused. For instance, the mass withdrawal mechanism
described in \[[RFC7432](#RFC7432){.xref}\] for fast failure detection
and propagation can be used. It is assumed per this section that an ESI
Overlay Index is used in this use case, but this use case does not
preclude the use of the VA\'s MAC address as an Overlay Index. If a MAC
is used as the Overlay Index, the control plane must follow the
procedures described in [Section
4.4.3](#sect-4.4.3){.xref}.[¶](#section-4.3-5){.pilcrow}

The model supports VA redundancy in a similar way to the one described
in [Section 4.2](#sect-4.2){.xref} for the floating IP Overlay Index use
case, except that it uses the EVPN Ethernet A-D per EVI route instead of
the MAC advertisement route to advertise the location of the Overlay
Index. The procedure is explained below:[¶](#section-4.3-6){.pilcrow}

    :::

In order to provide connectivity for [(1)](#step1){.xref}, MAC/IP
Advertisement routes (RT-2) are needed so that IRB or TS MACs and IPs
can be distributed. Connectivity type [(2)](#step2){.xref} is
accomplished by the exchange of IP Prefix routes (RT-5) for IPs and
subnets sitting behind certain Overlay Indexes, e.g., GW IP, ESI, or TS
MAC.[¶](#section-4.4-4){.pilcrow}

In some cases, IP Prefix routes may be advertised for subnets and IPs
sitting behind an IRB. This use case is referred to as the
\"IP-VRF-to-IP-VRF\" model.[¶](#section-4.4-5){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC9135](#RFC9135){.xref}\] defines an asymmetric IRB model and a
symmetric IRB model based on the required lookups at the ingress and
egress NVE. The asymmetric model requires an IP lookup and a MAC lookup
at the ingress NVE, whereas only a MAC lookup is needed at the egress
NVE; the symmetric model requires IP and MAC lookups at both the ingress
and egress NVE. From that perspective, the IP-VRF-to-IP-VRF use case
described in this section is a symmetric IRB
model.[¶](#section-4.4-6){.pilcrow}

Note that in an IP-VRF-to-IP-VRF scenario, out of the many subnets that
a tenant may have, it may be the case that only a few are attached to a
given IP-VRF of the NVE/PE. In order to provide inter-subnet
connectivity among the set of NVE/PEs where the tenant is connected, a
new SBD is created on all of them if a recursive resolution is needed.
This SBD is instantiated as a regular BD (with no ACs) in each NVE/PE
and has an IRB interface that connects the SBD to the IP-VRF. The IRB
interface\'s IP or MAC address is used as the Overlay Index for a
recursive resolution.[¶](#section-4.4-7){.pilcrow}

Depending on the existence and characteristics of the SBD and IRB
interfaces for the IP-VRFs, there are three different IP-VRF-to-IP-VRF
scenarios identified and described in this

This document provides a set of procedures to achieve inter-subnet
forwarding across NVEs or PEs attached to a group of BDs that belong to
the same tenant (or VPN). The security considerations discussed in
\[[RFC7432](#RFC7432){.xref}\] apply to the intra-subnet forwarding or
communication within each of those BDs. In addition, the security
considerations in \[[RFC4364](#RFC4364){.xref}\] should also be
understood, since this document and \[[RFC4364](#RFC4364){.xref}\] may
be used in similar applications.[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

Contrary to \[[RFC4364](#RFC4364){.xref}\], this document does not
describe PE/CE route distribution techniques but rather considers the
CEs as TSs or VAs that do not run dynamic routing protocols. This can be
considered a security advantage, since dynamic routing protocols can be
blocked on the NVE/PE ACs, not allowing the tenant to interact with the
infrastructure\'s dynamic routing protocols.[¶](#section-5-2){.pilcrow}

In this document, the RT-5 may use a regular BGP next hop for its
resolution or an Overlay Index that requires a recursive resolution to a
different EVPN route (an RT-2 or an RT-1). In the latter case, it is
worth noting that any action that ends up filtering or modifying the
RT-2 or RT-1 routes used to convey the Overlay Indexes will modify the
resolution of the RT-5 and therefore the forwarding of packets to the
remote subnet.[¶](#section-5-3){.pilcrow}
