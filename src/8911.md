The IETF specifies and uses Performance Metrics of protocols and
applications transported over its protocols. Performance Metrics are an
important part of network operations using IETF protocols, and
\[[RFC6390](#RFC6390){.xref}\] specifies guidelines for their
development.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

The definition and use of Performance Metrics in the IETF have been
fostered in various working groups (WGs). Most
notably:[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

-   [The \"IP Performance Metrics\" (IPPM) WG is the WG primarily
    focusing on Performance Metrics definition at the
    IETF.[¶](#section-1-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-3.1}
-   [The \"Benchmarking Methodology\" WG (BMWG) defines many Performance
    Metrics for use in laboratory benchmarking of internetworking
    technologies.[¶](#section-1-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-3.2}
-   [The \"Metric Blocks for use with RTCP\'s Extended Report
    Framework\" (XRBLOCK) WG (concluded) specified many Performance
    Metrics related to \"RTP Control Protocol Extended Reports (RTCP
    XR)\" \[[RFC3611](#RFC3611){.xref}\], which establishes a framework
    to allow new information to be conveyed in RTCP, supplementing the
    original report blocks defined in \"RTP: A Transport Protocol for
    Real-Time Applications\"
    \[[RFC3550](#RFC3550){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-3.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-3.3}
-   [The \"IP Flow Information eXport\" (IPFIX) WG (concluded) specified
    an Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) process for new
    Information Elements. Some Information Elements related to
    Performance Metrics are proposed on a regular
    basis.[¶](#section-1-3.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-3.4}
-   [The \"Performance Metrics for Other Layers\" (PMOL) WG (concluded)
    defined some Performance Metrics related to Session Initiation
    Protocol (SIP) voice quality
    \[[RFC6035](#RFC6035){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-3.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-3.5}

It is expected that more Performance Metrics will be defined in the
future \-- not only IP-based metrics but also metrics that are protocol
specific and application specific.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

Despite the importance of Performance Metrics, there are two related
problems for the industry:[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}

-   [First, ensuring that when one party requests that another party
    measure (or report or in some way act on) a particular Performance
    Metric, both parties have exactly the same understanding of what
    Performance Metric is being referred
    to.[¶](#section-1-6.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-6.1}
-   [Second, discovering which Performance Metrics have been specified,
    to avoid developing a new Performance Metric that is very similar
    but not quite
    interoperable.[¶](#section-1-6.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-6.2}

These problems can be addressed by creating a Registry for Performance
Metrics with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). As such,
this document defines the new IANA Registry for Performance
Metrics.[¶](#section-1-7){.pilcrow}

Per this document, IANA has created and now maintains the Performance
Metrics Registry, according to the maintenance procedures and the format
defined in the sections below. The resulting Performance Metrics
Registry is for use by the IETF and others. Although the Registry
formatting specifications herein are primarily for Registry creation by
IANA, any other organization that wishes to create a Performance Metrics
Registry may use the same formatting specifications for their purposes.
The authors make no guarantee of the Registry format\'s applicability to
any possible set of Performance Metrics envisaged by other
organizations, but we encourage others to apply it. In the remainder of
this document, unless we explicitly say otherwise, we will refer to the
IANA-maintained Performance Metrics Registry as simply the Performance
Metrics Registry.[¶](#section-1-8){.pilcrow}

Performance Metric:
:   A quantitative measure of performance, targeted to an IETF-specified
    protocol or targeted to an application transported over an
    IETF-specified protocol. Examples of Performance Metrics are the FTP
    response time for a complete file download, the DNS Response time to
    resolve the IP address(es), a database logging time, etc. This
    definition is consistent with the definition of a metric in
    \[[RFC2330](#RFC2330){.xref}\] and broader than the definition of a
    Performance Metric in
    \[[RFC6390](#RFC6390){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2-2.2){.pilcrow}
:   

Registered Performance Metric:
:   A Performance Metric expressed as an entry in the Performance
    Metrics Registry, administered by IANA. Such a Performance Metric
    has met all of the Registry review criteria defined in this document
    in order to be included in the
    Registry.[¶](#section-2-2.4){.pilcrow}
:   

Performance Metrics Registry:
:   The IANA Registry containing Registered Performance
    Metrics.[¶](#section-2-2.6){.pilcrow}
:   

Proprietary Registry:
:   A set of metrics that are registered in a proprietary Registry, as
    opposed to the Performance Metrics
    Registry.[¶](#section-2-2.8){.pilcrow}
:   

Performance Metrics Experts:
:   A group of designated experts \[[RFC8126](#RFC8126){.xref}\]
    selected by the IESG to validate the Performance Metrics before
    updating the Performance Metrics Registry. The Performance Metrics
    Experts work closely with IANA.[¶](#section-2-2.10){.pilcrow}
:   

Parameter:
:   An input factor defined as a variable in the definition of a
    Performance Metric. A Parameter is a numerical or other specified
    factor forming one of a set that defines a metric or sets the
    conditions of its operation. All Parameters must be known in order
    to make a measurement using a metric and interpret the results.
    There are two types of Parameters: Fixed and Runtime. For the Fixed
    Parameters, the value of the variable is specified in the
    Performance Metrics Registry Entry and different Fixed Parameter
    values results in different Registered Performance Metrics. For the
    Runtime Parameters, the value of the variable is defined when the
    Metric Measurement Method is executed and a given Registered
    Performance Metric supports multiple values for the Parameter.
    Although Runtime Parameters do not change the fundamental nature of
    the Performance Metric\'s definition, some have substantial
    influence on the network property being assessed and interpretation
    of the results.[¶](#section-2-2.12){.pilcrow}
:   

Note: Consider the case of packet loss in the following two Active
Measurement Method cases. The first case is packet loss as background
loss where the Runtime Parameter set includes a very sparse Poisson
stream and only characterizes the times when packets were lost. Actual
user streams likely see much higher loss at these times, due to tail
drop or radio errors. The second case is packet loss ratio as the
complimentary probability of delivery ratio where the Runtime Parameter
set includes a very dense, bursty stream, and characterizes the loss
experienced by a stream that approximates a user stream. These are both
\"Loss metrics\", but the difference in interpretation of the results is
highly dependent on the Runtime Parameters (at least), to the extreme
where we are actually using loss ratio to infer its complimentary
probability: delivery ratio.[¶](#section-2-3.1){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

Active Measurement Methods:
:   Methods of Measurement conducted on traffic that serves only the
    purpose of measurement and is generated for that reason alone, and
    whose traffic characteristics are known a priori. The complete
    definition of Active Methods is specified in [Section
    3.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7799#section-3.4){.relref} of
    \[[RFC7799](#RFC7799){.xref}\]. Examples of Active Measurement
    Methods are the Measurement Methods for the one-way delay metric
    defined in \[[RFC7679](#RFC7679){.xref}\] and the round-trip delay
    metric defined in
    \[[RFC2681](#RFC2681){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2-4.2){.pilcrow}
:   

Passive Measurement Methods:
:   Methods of Measurement conducted on network traffic, generated by
    either (1) the end users or (2) network elements that would exist
    regardless of whether the measurement was being conducted or not.
    The complete definition of Passive Methods is specified in [Section
    3.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7799#section-3.6){.relref} of
    \[[RFC7799](#RFC7799){.xref}\]. One characteristic of Passive
    Measurement Methods is that sensitive information may be observed
    and, as a consequence, stored in the measurement
    system.[¶](#section-2-4.4){.pilcrow}
:   

Hybrid Measurement Methods:
:   Methods of Measurement that use a combination of Active Methods and
    Passive Methods, to assess Active Metrics, Passive Metrics, or new
    metrics derived from the a priori knowledge and observations of the
    stream of interest. The complete definition of Hybrid Methods is

Other organizations that standardize performance metrics are encouraged
to use the process defined in this memo to propose a candidate
Registered Performance Metric. In addition, this document may be useful
for other organizations who are defining a Performance Metrics Registry

Registry defined in this document.[¶](#section-3-3){.pilcrow}

This Performance Metrics Registry is applicable to Performance Metrics
derived from Active Measurement, Passive Measurement, and any other form
of Performance Metric. This Registry is designed to encompass
Performance Metrics developed throughout the IETF and especially for the
technologies specified in the following working groups: IPPM, XRBLOCK,
IPFIX, and BMWG. This document analyzes a prior attempt to set up a
Performance Metrics Registry and the reasons why this design was

### [4.1.](#section-4.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Interoperability](#name-interoperability){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-interoperability}

As with any IETF Registry, the primary intention is to manage the
registration of Identifiers for use within one or more protocols. In the
particular case of the Performance Metrics Registry, there are two types
of protocols that will use the Performance Metrics in the Performance
Metrics Registry during their operation (by referring to the index
values):[¶](#section-4.1-1){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

Control Protocol:
:   This type of protocol is used to allow one entity to request that
    another entity perform a measurement using a specific metric defined
    by the Performance Metrics Registry. One particular example is the
    Large-scale Measurement of Broadband Performance (LMAP) framework
    \[[RFC7594](#RFC7594){.xref}\]. Using the LMAP terminology, the
    Performance Metrics Registry is used in the LMAP Control Protocol to
    allow a Controller to schedule a Measurement Task for one or more
    Measurement Agents. In order to enable this use case, the entries in
    the Performance Metrics Registry must be sufficiently defined to
    allow a Measurement Agent implementation to trigger a specific
    Measurement Task upon the reception of a Control Protocol message.
    This requirement heavily constrains the types of entries that are
    acceptable for the Performance Metrics
    Registry.[¶](#section-4.1-2.2){.pilcrow}
:   

Report Protocol:
:   This type of protocol is used to allow an entity to report
    Measurement Results to another entity. By referencing to a specific
    Registered Performance Metric, it is possible to properly
    characterize the Measurement Result data being reported. Using the
    LMAP terminology, the Performance Metrics Registry is used in the
    LMAP Report Protocol to allow a Measurement Agent to report
    Measurement Results to a Collector.[¶](#section-4.1-2.4){.pilcrow}
:   

It should be noted that the LMAP framework explicitly allows for using
not only the IANA-maintained Performance Metrics Registry but also other
registries containing Performance Metrics, i.e., either (1) registries
defined by other organizations or (2) private registries. However,
others who are creating registries to be used in the context of an LMAP
framework are encouraged to use the Registry format defined in this
document, because this makes it easier for developers of LMAP
Measurement Agents to programmatically use information found in those
other registries\' entries.[¶](#section-4.1-3){.pilcrow}
:::

::: {#section-4.2 .section}
### [4.2.](#section-4.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Single Point of Reference for Performance Metrics](#name-single-point-of-reference-f){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-single-point-of-reference-f}

A Performance Metrics Registry serves as a single point of reference for
Performance Metrics defined in different working groups in the IETF. As
we mentioned earlier, there are several working groups that define
Performance Metrics in the IETF, and it is hard to keep track of all of
them. This results in multiple definitions of similar Performance
Metrics that attempt to measure the same phenomena but in slightly
different (and incompatible) ways. Having a Registry would allow the
IETF community and others to have a single list of relevant Performance
Metrics defined by the IETF (and others, where appropriate). The single
list is also an essential aspect of communication about Performance
Metrics, where different entities that request measurements, execute
measurements, and report the results can benefit from a common
understanding of the referenced Performance
Metric.[¶](#section-4.2-1){.pilcrow}
:::

::: {#section-4.3 .section}
### [4.3.](#section-4.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Side Benefits](#name-side-benefits){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-side-benefits}

There are a couple of side benefits of having such a Registry. First,
the Performance Metrics Registry could serve as an inventory of useful
and used Performance Metrics that are normally supported by different
implementations of Measurement Agents. Second, the results of
measurements using the Performance Metrics should be comparable even if
they are performed by different implementations and in different
networks, as the Performance Metric is properly defined. BCP 176
\[[RFC6576](#RFC6576){.xref}\] examines whether the results produced by
independent implementations are equivalent in the context of evaluating
the completeness and clarity of metric specifications.
\[[RFC6576](#RFC6576){.xref}\] is a BCP \[[RFC2026](#RFC2026){.xref}\]
that defines the Standards Track advancement testing for (Active) IPPM
Metrics, and the same process will likely suffice to determine whether
Registered Performance Metrics are sufficiently well specified to result
in comparable (or equivalent) results. If a Registered Performance
Metric has undergone such testing, this [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be noted in
\"Comments and Remarks\" (see [Section 7.6](#remarks){.xref}), with a
reference to the test results.[¶](#section-4.3-1){.pilcrow}

## [5.](#section-5){.section-number .selfRef} [Criteria for Performance Metrics Registration](#name-criteria-for-performance-me){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-criteria-for-performance-me}

It is neither possible nor desirable to populate the Performance Metrics
Registry with all combinations of Parameters of all Performance Metrics.
A Registered Performance Metric [SHOULD]{.bcp14}
be:[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

1.  [Interpretable by the human
    user.[¶](#section-5-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-5-2.1}
2.  [Implementable by the software or hardware
    designer.[¶](#section-5-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-5-2.2}
3.  [Deployable by network
    operators.[¶](#section-5-2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-5-2.3}
4.  [Accurate in terms of producing equivalent results, and for
    interoperability and deployment across
    vendors.[¶](#section-5-2.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-5-2.4}
5.  [Operationally useful, so that it has significant industry interest
    and/or has seen
    deployment.[¶](#section-5-2.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-5-2.5}
6.  [Sufficiently tightly defined, so that different values for the
    Runtime Parameters do not change the fundamental nature of the
    measurement or change the practicality of its
    implementation.[¶](#section-5-2.6){.pilcrow}]{#section-5-2.6}

In essence, there needs to be evidence that (1) a candidate Registered
Performance Metric has significant industry interest or has seen
deployment and (2) there is agreement that the candidate Registered
Performance Metric serves its intended
purpose.[¶](#section-5-3){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-6 .section}
## [6.](#section-6){.section-number .selfRef} [Performance Metrics Registry: Prior Attempt](#name-performance-metrics-registr){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-performance-metrics-registr}

There was a previous attempt to define a Metrics Registry
\[[RFC4148](#RFC4148){.xref}\]. However, it was obsoleted by
\[[RFC6248](#RFC6248){.xref}\] because it was \"found to be
insufficiently detailed to uniquely identify IPPM metrics\... \[there
was too much\] variability possible when characterizing a metric
exactly\", which led to the IPPM Metrics Registry defined in
\[[RFC4148](#RFC4148){.xref}\] having \"very few users, if
any.\"[¶](#section-6-1){.pilcrow}

Three interesting additional quotes from \[[RFC6248](#RFC6248){.xref}\]
might help to understand the issues related to that
registry.[¶](#section-6-2){.pilcrow}

1.  [\"It is not believed to be feasible or even useful to register
    every possible combination of Type P, metric parameters, and Stream
    parameters using the current structure of the IPPM Metrics
    Registry.\"[¶](#section-6-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-6-3.1}
2.  [\"The current registry structure has been found to be
    insufficiently detailed to uniquely identify IPPM
    metrics.\"[¶](#section-6-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-6-3.2}
3.  [\"Despite apparent efforts to find current or even future users, no
    one responded to the call for interest in the RFC 4148 registry
    during the second half of
    2010.\"[¶](#section-6-3.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-6-3.3}

The current approach learns from this by tightly defining each
Registered Performance Metric with only a few variable (Runtime)
Parameters to be specified by the measurement designer, if any. The idea
is that entries in the Performance Metrics Registry stem from different
Measurement Methods that require input (Runtime) Parameters to set
factors like Source and Destination addresses (which do not change the
fundamental nature of the measurement). The downside of this approach is
that it could result in a large number of entries in the Performance
Metrics Registry. There is agreement that less is more in this context
\-- it is better to have a reduced set of useful metrics rather than a
large set of metrics, some with questionable
usefulness.[¶](#section-6-4){.pilcrow}

### [6.1.](#section-6.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Why This Attempt Should Succeed](#name-why-this-attempt-should-suc){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-why-this-attempt-should-suc}

As mentioned in the previous section, one of the main issues with the
previous Registry was that the metrics contained in the Registry were
too generic to be useful. This document specifies stricter criteria for
Performance Metric registration (see [Section
5](#metrics-criteria){.xref}) and imposes a group of Performance Metrics
Experts that will provide guidelines to assess if a Performance Metric
is properly specified.[¶](#section-6.1-1){.pilcrow}

Another key difference between this attempt and the previous one is that
in this case there is at least one clear user for the Performance
Metrics Registry: the LMAP framework and protocol. Because the LMAP
protocol will use the Performance Metrics Registry values in its
operation, this actually helps to determine if a metric is properly
defined \-- in particular, since we expect that the LMAP Control
Protocol will enable a Controller to request that a Measurement Agent
perform a measurement using a given metric by embedding the Performance
Metrics Registry Identifier in the protocol. Such a metric and method
are properly specified if they are defined well enough so that it is
possible (and practical) to implement them in the Measurement Agent.
This was the failure of the previous attempt: a Registry Entry with an
undefined Type-P ([Section
13](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2330#section-13){.relref} of
\[[RFC2330](#RFC2330){.xref}\]) allows measurement results to vary
significantly.[¶](#section-6.1-2){.pilcrow}

This Performance Metrics Registry is applicable to Performance Metrics
used for Active Measurement, Passive Measurement, and any other form of
Performance Measurement. Each category of measurement has unique
properties, so some of the columns defined below are not applicable for
a given metric category. In this case, the column(s) [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be
populated with the \"N/A\" value (Not Applicable). However, the \"N/A\"
value [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be used by any metric in the following columns:
Identifier, Name, URI, Status, Requester, Revision, Revision Date,
Description. In the future, a new category of metrics could require
additional columns, and adding new columns is a recognized form of
Registry extension. The specification defining the new column(s)
[MUST]{.bcp14} give general guidelines for populating the new column(s)
for existing entries.[¶](#section-7-1){.pilcrow}

The columns of the Performance Metrics Registry are defined below. The
columns are grouped into \"Categories\" to facilitate the use of the
Registry. Categories are described at the \"Section 7.x\" heading level,
and columns are described at the \"Section 7.x.y\" heading level. The
figure below illustrates this organization. An entry (row) therefore
gives a complete description of a Registered Performance

There is a blank template of the Registry template provided in [Section
11](#blank-reg-template){.xref} of this memo.[¶](#section-7-7){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-7.1.1 .section}
#### [7.1.1.](#section-7.1.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Identifier](#name-identifier){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-identifier}

This column provides a numeric Identifier for the Registered Performance
Metric. The Identifier of each Registered Performance Metric
[MUST]{.bcp14} be unique. Note that revising a Metric according to the
process in [Section 8.2](#revise-reg-perf-metrics){.xref} creates a new
entry in the Performance Metrics Registry with the same
identifier.[¶](#section-7.1.1-1){.pilcrow}

The Registered Performance Metric unique Identifier is an unbounded
integer (range 0 to infinity).[¶](#section-7.1.1-2){.pilcrow}

The Identifier 0 should be Reserved. The Identifier values from 64512 to
65535 are reserved for private or experimental use, and the user may
encounter overlapping uses.[¶](#section-7.1.1-3){.pilcrow}

When adding new Registered Performance Metrics to the Performance
Metrics Registry, IANA [SHOULD]{.bcp14} assign the lowest available
Identifier to the new Registered Performance
Metric.[¶](#section-7.1.1-4){.pilcrow}

If a Performance Metrics Expert providing review determines that there
is a reason to assign a specific numeric Identifier, possibly leaving a
temporary gap in the numbering, then the Performance Metrics Expert
[SHALL]{.bcp14} inform IANA of this
decision.[¶](#section-7.1.1-5){.pilcrow}

As the Name of a Registered Performance Metric is the first thing a
potential human implementer will use when determining whether it is
suitable for their measurement study, it is important to be as precise
and descriptive as possible. In the future, users will review the Names
to determine if the metric they want to measure has already been
registered, or if a similar entry is available, as a basis for creating
a new entry.[¶](#section-7.1.2-1){.pilcrow}

Spec:
:   An immutable document Identifier combined with a document section
    Identifier. For RFCs, this consists of the RFC number and major
    section number that specifies this Registry Entry in the form
    \"RFCXXXXsecY\", e.g., RFC7799sec3. Note: The RFC number is not the
    primary reference specification for the metric definition (e.g.,
    \[[RFC7679](#RFC7679){.xref}\] as the primary reference
    specification for one-way delay metrics); it will contain the
    placeholder \"RFCXXXXsecY\" until the RFC number is assigned to the
    specifying document and would remain blank in Private Registry
    Entries without a corresponding RFC. Anticipating the \"RFC10K\"
    problem, the number of the RFC continues to replace \"RFCXXXX\",
    regardless of the number of digits in the RFC number. Anticipating
    Registry Entries from other standards bodies, the form of this Name

    uniqueness by the Expert Reviewer.[¶](#section-7.1.2-11.2){.pilcrow}

values of input factors, called \"Fixed Parameters\", which are left
open in the immutable document but have a particular value defined by
the Performance Metric.[¶](#section-7.2-1){.pilcrow}

#### [7.2.1.](#section-7.2.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Reference Definition](#name-reference-definition){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-reference-definition}

This entry provides a reference (or references) to the relevant sections
of the document or documents that define the metric, as well as any
supplemental information needed to ensure an unambiguous definition for
implementations. A given reference needs to be an immutable document,
such as an RFC; for other standards bodies, it is likely to be necessary
to reference a specific, dated version of a
specification.[¶](#section-7.2.1-1){.pilcrow}

#### [7.2.2.](#section-7.2.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Fixed Parameters](#name-fixed-parameters){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-fixed-parameters}

Fixed Parameters are Parameters whose values must be specified in the
Performance Metrics Registry. The measurement system uses these
values.[¶](#section-7.2.2-1){.pilcrow}

Where referenced metrics supply a list of Parameters as part of their
descriptive template, a subset of the Parameters will be designated as
Fixed Parameters. As an example for Active Metrics, Fixed Parameters
determine most or all of the IPPM framework convention \"packets of
Type-P\" as described in \[[RFC2330](#RFC2330){.xref}\], such as
transport protocol, payload length, TTL, etc. An example for Passive
Metrics is for an RTP packet loss calculation that relies on the
validation of a packet as RTP, which is a multi-packet validation
controlled by the MIN_SEQUENTIAL variable as defined by
\[[RFC3550](#RFC3550){.xref}\]. Varying MIN_SEQUENTIAL values can alter
the loss report, and this variable could be set as a Fixed
Parameter.[¶](#section-7.2.2-2){.pilcrow}

Parameters [MUST]{.bcp14} have well-defined names. For human readers,
the hanging-indent style is preferred, and any Parameter names and
definitions that do not appear in the Reference Method Specification
[MUST]{.bcp14} appear in this column (or the Runtime Parameters
column).[¶](#section-7.2.2-3){.pilcrow}

Parameters [MUST]{.bcp14} have a well-specified data
format.[¶](#section-7.2.2-4){.pilcrow}

A Parameter that is a Fixed Parameter for one Performance Metrics
Registry Entry may be designated as a Runtime Parameter for another
Performance Metrics Registry Entry.[¶](#section-7.2.2-5){.pilcrow}

#### [7.3.1.](#section-7.3.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Reference Method](#name-reference-method){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-reference-method}

This entry provides references to relevant sections of immutable
documents, such as RFC(s) (for other standards bodies, it is likely to
be necessary to reference a specific, dated version of a specification)
describing the Method of Measurement, as well as any supplemental
information needed to ensure unambiguous interpretation for
implementations referring to the immutable document
text.[¶](#section-7.3.1-1){.pilcrow}

Specifically, this section should include pointers to pseudocode or
actual code that could be used for an unambiguous
implementation.[¶](#section-7.3.1-2){.pilcrow}
:::

::: {#section-7.3.2 .section}
#### [7.3.2.](#section-7.3.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Packet Stream Generation](#name-packet-stream-generation){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-packet-stream-generation}

This column applies to Performance Metrics that generate traffic as part
of their Measurement Method, including, but not necessarily limited to,
Active Metrics. The generated traffic is referred to as a \"stream\",
and this column describes its
characteristics.[¶](#section-7.3.2-1){.pilcrow}

Each entry for this column contains the following
information:[¶](#section-7.3.2-2){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

Value:
:   The name of the packet stream scheduling
    discipline[¶](#section-7.3.2-3.2){.pilcrow}
:   

Reference:
:   The specification where the Parameters of the stream are
    defined[¶](#section-7.3.2-3.4){.pilcrow}
:   

The packet generation stream may require Parameters such as the average
packet rate and distribution truncation value for streams with
Poisson-distributed inter-packet sending times. If such Parameters are
needed, they should be included in either the Fixed Parameters column or
the Runtime Parameters column, depending on whether they will be fixed
or will be an input for the metric.[¶](#section-7.3.2-4){.pilcrow}

The simplest example of stream specification is singleton scheduling
(see \[[RFC2330](#RFC2330){.xref}\]), where a single atomic measurement
is conducted. Each atomic measurement could consist of sending a single
packet (such as a DNS request) or sending several packets (for example,
to request a web page). Other streams support a series of atomic
measurements using pairs of packets, where the packet stream follows a
schedule defining the timing between transmitted packets, and an atomic
measurement assesses the reception time between successive packets
(e.g., a measurement of Inter-Packet Delay Variation). More complex
streams and measurement relationships are possible. Principally, two
different streams are used in IPPM Metrics: (1) Poisson, distributed as
described in \[[RFC2330](#RFC2330){.xref}\] and (2) periodic, as
described in \[[RFC3432](#RFC3432){.xref}\]. Both Poisson and periodic
have their own unique Parameters, and the relevant set of Parameter
names and values should be included in either the Fixed Parameters
column or the Runtime Parameters column.[¶](#section-7.3.2-5){.pilcrow}
:::

::: {#section-7.3.3 .section}
#### [7.3.3.](#section-7.3.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Traffic Filter](#name-traffic-filter){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-traffic-filter}

This column applies to Performance Metrics that observe packets flowing
through (the device with) the Measurement Agent, i.e., packets that are
not necessarily addressed to the Measurement Agent. This includes, but
is not limited to, Passive Metrics. The filter specifies the traffic
that is measured. This includes protocol field values/ranges, such as
address ranges, and flow or session
Identifiers.[¶](#section-7.3.3-1){.pilcrow}

The Traffic Filter itself depends on the needs of the metric itself and
a balance of an operator\'s measurement needs and a user\'s need for
privacy. Mechanics for conveying the filter criteria might be the BPF
(Berkeley Packet Filter) or PSAMP (Packet Sampling)
\[[RFC5475](#RFC5475){.xref}\] Property Match Filtering, which reuses
IPFIX \[[RFC7012](#RFC7012){.xref}\]. An example BPF string for matching
TCP/80 traffic to remote Destination net 192.0.2.0/24 would be \"dst net
192.0.2.0/24 and tcp dst port 80\". More complex filter engines may
allow for matching using Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)
technology.[¶](#section-7.3.3-2){.pilcrow}

The Traffic Filter includes the following
information:[¶](#section-7.3.3-3){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

Type:

#### [7.3.4.](#section-7.3.4){.section-number .selfRef} [Sampling Distribution](#name-sampling-distribution){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-sampling-distribution}

The sampling distribution defines, out of all of the packets that match
the Traffic Filter, which one or more of those packets are actually used
for the measurement. One possibility is \"all\", which implies that all
packets matching the Traffic Filter are considered, but there may be
other sampling strategies. It includes the following
information:[¶](#section-7.3.4-1){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

Value:
:   The name of the sampling
    distribution[¶](#section-7.3.4-2.2){.pilcrow}
:   

Reference definition:
:   Pointer to the specification where the sampling distribution is
    properly defined[¶](#section-7.3.4-2.4){.pilcrow}
:   

The sampling distribution may require Parameters. If such Parameters are
needed, they should be included in either the Fixed Parameters column or
the Runtime Parameters column, depending on whether they will be fixed
or will be an input for the metric.[¶](#section-7.3.4-3){.pilcrow}

PSAMP is documented in \"Sampling and Filtering Techniques for IP Packet
Selection\" \[[RFC5475](#RFC5475){.xref}\], while \"A Framework for
Packet Selection and Reporting\" \[[RFC5474](#RFC5474){.xref}\] provides
more background information. The sampling distribution Parameters might
be expressed in terms of the model described in \"Information Model for
Packet Sampling Exports\" \[[RFC5477](#RFC5477){.xref}\] and the process
provided in \"Flow Selection Techniques\"

#### [7.3.5.](#section-7.3.5){.section-number .selfRef} [Runtime Parameters](#name-runtime-parameters){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-runtime-parameters}

In contrast to the Fixed Parameters, Runtime Parameters are Parameters
that do not change the fundamental nature of the measurement and their
values are not specified in the Performance Metrics Registry. They are
left as variables in the Registry, as an aid to the measurement system
implementer or user. Their values are supplied on execution, configured
into the measurement system, and reported with the Measurement Results
(so that the context is complete).[¶](#section-7.3.5-1){.pilcrow}

Where metrics supply a list of Parameters as part of their descriptive
template, a subset of the Parameters will be designated as Runtime
Parameters.[¶](#section-7.3.5-2){.pilcrow}

Parameters [MUST]{.bcp14} have well-defined names. For human readers,
the hanging-indent style is preferred, and the names and definitions
that do not appear in the Reference Method Specification [MUST]{.bcp14}
appear in this column.[¶](#section-7.3.5-3){.pilcrow}

A data format for each Runtime Parameter [MUST]{.bcp14} be specified in
this column, to simplify the control and implementation of measurement
devices. For example, Parameters that include an IPv4 address can be
encoded as a 32-bit integer (i.e., a binary base64-encoded value) or
\"ip‑address\" as defined in \[[RFC6991](#RFC6991){.xref}\]. The actual
encoding(s) used must be explicitly defined for each Runtime Parameter.
IPv6 addresses and options [MUST]{.bcp14} be accommodated, allowing
Registered Performance Metrics to be used in that address family. Other
address families are permissible.[¶](#section-7.3.5-4){.pilcrow}

Examples of Runtime Parameters include IP addresses, measurement point
designations, start times and end times for measurement, and other
information essential to the Method of
Measurement.[¶](#section-7.3.5-5){.pilcrow}

#### [7.3.6.](#section-7.3.6){.section-number .selfRef} [Role](#name-role){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-role}

In some Methods of Measurement, there may be several Roles defined,
e.g., for a one-way packet delay Active Measurement, there is one
Measurement Agent that generates the packets and another Agent that
receives the packets. This column contains the name of the Role(s) for
this particular entry. In the one-way delay example above, there should
be two entries in the Registry\'s Role column, one for each Role (Source
and Destination). When a Measurement Agent is instructed to perform the
\"Source\" Role for the one-way delay metric, the Agent knows that it is
required to generate packets. The values for this field are defined in
the Reference Method of Measurement (and this frequently results in
abbreviated Role names such as \"Src\").[¶](#section-7.3.6-1){.pilcrow}

When the Role column of a Registry Entry defines more than one Role, the
Role [SHALL]{.bcp14} be treated as a Runtime Parameter and supplied for
execution. It should be noted that the LMAP framework
\[[RFC7594](#RFC7594){.xref}\] distinguishes the Role from other Runtime
Parameters.[¶](#section-7.3.6-2){.pilcrow}

statistic may be specified in this column to summarize the results to a
single value. If the complete set of measured singletons is output, this
will be specified here.[¶](#section-7.4-1){.pilcrow}

Some metrics embed one specific statistic in the reference metric
definition, while others allow several output types or
statistics.[¶](#section-7.4-2){.pilcrow}

#### [7.4.1.](#section-7.4.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Type](#name-type){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-type}

This column contains the name of the output type. The output type
defines a single type of result that the metric produces. It can be the
raw results (packet send times and singleton metrics), or it can be a
summary statistic. The specification of the output type [MUST]{.bcp14}
define the format of the output. In some systems, format specifications
will simplify both measurement implementation and collection/storage
tasks. Note that if two different statistics are required from a single
measurement (for example, both \"Xth percentile mean\" and \"Raw\"),
then a new output type must be defined (\"Xth percentile mean AND
Raw\"). See [Section 7.1.2](#name-sec7-1-2){.xref} above for a list of

Some specifications for Methods of Measurement include the ability to
perform an error calibration. [Section
3.7.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7679#section-3.7.3){.relref} of
\[[RFC7679](#RFC7679){.xref}\] is one example. In the Registry Entry,
this field will identify a method of calibration for the metric, and,
when available, the measurement system [SHOULD]{.bcp14} perform the
calibration when requested and produce the output with an indication
that it is the result of a calibration method. In-situ calibration could
be enabled with an internal loopback that includes as much of the
measurement system as possible, performs address manipulation as needed,
and provides some form of isolation (e.g., deterministic delay) to avoid
send-receive interface contention. Some portion of the random and
systematic error can be characterized in this
way.[¶](#section-7.4.4-1){.pilcrow}

For one-way delay measurements, the error calibration must include an
assessment of the internal clock synchronization with its external
reference (this internal clock is supplying timestamps for measurement).
In practice, the time offsets of clocks at both the Source and
Destination are needed to estimate the systematic error due to imperfect
clock synchronization (the time offsets are smoothed; thus, the random
variation is not usually represented in the
results).[¶](#section-7.4.4-2){.pilcrow}

Both internal loopback calibration and clock synchronization can be used
to estimate the \*available accuracy\* of the Output Metric Units. For
example, repeated loopback delay measurements will reveal the portion of
the output result resolution that is the result of system noise and is
thus inaccurate.[¶](#section-7.4.4-3){.pilcrow}

Once a Performance Metric or set of Performance Metrics has been
identified for a given application, candidate Performance Metrics
Registry Entry specifications prepared in accordance with [Section
7](#columns){.xref} should be submitted to IANA to follow the process
for review by the Performance Metrics Experts, as defined below. This
process is also used for other changes to a Performance Metrics Registry
Entry, such as deprecation or revision, as described later in this
section.[¶](#section-8-1){.pilcrow}

It is desirable that the author(s) of a candidate Performance Metrics
Registry Entry seek review in the relevant IETF working group or offer
the opportunity for review on the working group mailing
list.[¶](#section-8-2){.pilcrow}

### [8.1.](#section-8.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Adding New Performance Metrics to the Performance Metrics Registry](#name-adding-new-performance-metr){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-adding-new-performance-metr}

Requests to add Registered Performance Metrics in the Performance
Metrics Registry [SHALL]{.bcp14} be submitted to IANA, which forwards
the request to a designated group of experts (Performance Metrics
Experts) appointed by the IESG; these are the reviewers called for by
the Specification Required policy \[[RFC8126](#RFC8126){.xref}\] defined
for the Performance Metrics Registry. The Performance Metrics Experts
review the request for such things as compliance with this document,
compliance with other applicable Performance Metrics-related RFCs, and
consistency with the currently defined set of Registered Performance
Metrics. The most efficient path for submission begins with preparation
of an Internet-Draft containing the proposed Performance Metrics
Registry Entry using the template in [Section
11](#blank-reg-template){.xref}, so that the submission formatting will
benefit from the normal IETF Internet-Draft submission processing
(including HTMLization).[¶](#section-8.1-1){.pilcrow}

Submission to IANA may be during IESG review (leading to IETF Standards
Action), where an Internet-Draft proposes one or more Registered
Performance Metrics to be added to the Performance Metrics Registry,
including the text of the proposed Registered Performance
Metric⁠(s).[¶](#section-8.1-2){.pilcrow}

If an RFC-to-be includes a Performance Metric and a proposed Performance
Metrics Registry Entry but the Performance Metrics Expert\'s review
determines that one or more of the criteria listed in [Section
5](#metrics-criteria){.xref} have not been met, then the proposed
Performance Metrics Registry Entry [MUST]{.bcp14} be removed from the
text. Once evidence exists that the Performance Metric meets the
criteria in [Section 5](#metrics-criteria){.xref}, the proposed
Performance Metrics Registry Entry [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be submitted to IANA
to be evaluated in consultation with the Performance Metrics Experts for
registration at that time.[¶](#section-8.1-3){.pilcrow}

Authors of proposed Registered Performance Metrics [SHOULD]{.bcp14}
review compliance with the specifications in this document to check
their submissions before sending them to
IANA.[¶](#section-8.1-4){.pilcrow}

At least one Performance Metrics Expert should endeavor to complete
referred reviews in a timely manner. If the request is acceptable, the
Performance Metrics Experts signify their approval to IANA, and IANA
updates the Performance Metrics Registry. If the request is not
acceptable, the Performance Metrics Experts [MAY]{.bcp14} coordinate
with the requester to change the request so that it is compliant;
otherwise, IANA [SHALL]{.bcp14} coordinate resolution of issues on
behalf of the expert. The Performance Metrics Experts [MAY]{.bcp14}
choose to reject clearly frivolous or inappropriate change requests
outright, but such exceptional circumstances should be
rare.[¶](#section-8.1-5){.pilcrow}

If the proposed Metric is unique in a significant way, in order to
properly describe the Metric, it may be necessary to propose a new Name
Element Registry, or (more likely) a new Entry in an existing Name
Element Registry. This proposal is part of the request for the new
Metric, so that it undergoes the same IANA review and approval
process.[¶](#section-8.1-6){.pilcrow}

Decisions by the Performance Metrics Experts may be appealed per
[Section 10](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8126#section-10){.relref}

### [8.2.](#section-8.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Backward-Compatible Revision of Registered Performance Metrics](#name-backward-compatible-revisio){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-backward-compatible-revisio}

A request for revision is only permitted when the requested changes
maintain backward compatibility with implementations of the prior
Performance Metrics Registry Entry describing a Registered Performance
Metric (entries with lower revision numbers but having the same
Identifier and Name).[¶](#section-8.2-1){.pilcrow}

The purpose of the Status field in the Performance Metrics Registry is
to indicate whether the entry for a Registered Performance Metric is
\'Current\', \'Deprecated\', or \'Obsolete\'. The term \'deprecated\' is
used when an entry is replaced, either with a backwards-compatible
revision (this sub-section) or with a non-backwards-compatible revision
(in [Section
8.3](#deprecating-metrics){.xref}).[¶](#section-8.2-2){.pilcrow}

In addition, no policy is defined for revising the Performance Metric
Entries in the IANA Registry or addressing errors therein. To be clear,
changes and deprecations within the Performance Metrics Registry are not
encouraged and should be avoided to the extent possible. However, in
recognition that change is inevitable, the provisions of this section
address the need for revisions.[¶](#section-8.2-3){.pilcrow}

Revisions are initiated by sending a candidate Registered Performance
Metric definition to IANA, per [Section
8.1](#add-new-perf-metrics){.xref}, identifying the existing Performance
Metrics Registry Entry, and explaining how and why the existing entry
should be revised.[¶](#section-8.2-4){.pilcrow}

The primary requirement in the definition of procedures for managing
changes to existing Registered Performance Metrics is avoidance of
measurement interoperability problems; the Performance Metrics Experts
must work to maintain interoperability above all else. Changes to
Registered Performance Metrics may only be done in an interoperable way;
necessary changes that cannot be done in a way that allows
interoperability with unchanged implementations [MUST]{.bcp14} result in
the creation of a new Registered Performance Metric (with a new Name,
replacing the RFCXXXXsecY portion of the Name) and possibly the
deprecation of the earlier metric.[¶](#section-8.2-5){.pilcrow}

A change to a Registered Performance Metric [SHALL]{.bcp14} be
determined to be backward compatible when:[¶](#section-8.2-6){.pilcrow}

1.  [it involves the correction of an error that is obviously only
    editorial, or[¶](#section-8.2-7.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-8.2-7.1}
2.  [it corrects an ambiguity in the Registered Performance Metric\'s
    definition, which itself leads to issues severe enough to prevent
    the Registered Performance Metric\'s usage as originally defined,
    or[¶](#section-8.2-7.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-8.2-7.2}
3.  [it corrects missing information in the metric definition without
    changing its meaning (e.g., the explicit definition of \'quantity\'
    semantics for numeric fields without a Data Type Semantics value),
    or[¶](#section-8.2-7.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-8.2-7.3}
4.  [it harmonizes with an external reference that was itself corrected,
    or[¶](#section-8.2-7.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-8.2-7.4}
5.  [if the current Registry format has been revised by adding a new
    column that is not relevant to an existing Registered Performance
    Metric (i.e., the new column can be safely filled in with \"Not
    Applicable\").[¶](#section-8.2-7.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-8.2-7.5}

If a Performance Metric revision is deemed permissible and backward
compatible by the Performance Metrics Experts, according to the rules in
this document, IANA [SHOULD]{.bcp14} execute the change(s) in the
Performance Metrics Registry. The requester of the change is appended to
the original requester in the Performance Metrics Registry. The Name of
the revised Registered Performance Metric, including the RFCXXXXsecY
portion of the Name, [SHALL]{.bcp14} remain unchanged even when the
change is the result of IETF Standards Action. The revised Registry
Entry [SHOULD]{.bcp14} reference the new immutable document, such as an
RFC. For other standards bodies, it is likely to be necessary to
reference a specific, dated version of a specification, in an
appropriate category and column.[¶](#section-8.2-8){.pilcrow}

Each Registered Performance Metric in the Performance Metrics Registry
has a revision number, starting at zero. Each change to a Registered
Performance Metric following this process increments the revision number
by one.[¶](#section-8.2-9){.pilcrow}

When a revised Registered Performance Metric is accepted into the
Performance Metrics Registry, the date of acceptance of the most recent
revision is placed into the Revision Date column of the Registry for
that Registered Performance Metric.[¶](#section-8.2-10){.pilcrow}

Where applicable, additions to Registered Performance Metrics in the
form of text in the Comments or Remarks column should include the date,
but such additions may not constitute a revision according to this
process.[¶](#section-8.2-11){.pilcrow}

Older versions of the updated Metric Entries are kept in the Registry
for archival purposes. The older entries are kept with all fields
unmodified (including Revision Date) except for the Status field, which
[SHALL]{.bcp14} be changed to
\'Deprecated\'.[¶](#section-8.2-12){.pilcrow}

This process should not in any way be construed as allowing the
Performance Metrics Experts to overrule IETF consensus. Specifically,
any Registered Performance Metrics that were added to the Performance
Metrics Registry with IETF consensus require IETF consensus for revision
or deprecation.[¶](#section-8.2-13){.pilcrow}

A request for deprecation is sent to IANA, which passes it to the
Performance Metrics Experts for review. When deprecating a Performance
Metric, the Performance Metric Description in the Performance Metrics
Registry [MUST]{.bcp14} be updated to explain the deprecation, as well
as to refer to the new Performance Metric created to replace the
deprecated Performance Metric.[¶](#section-8.3-3){.pilcrow}

When a new, non-backward-compatible Performance Metric replaces a (now)
deprecated metric, the revision number of the new Registered Performance
Metric is incremented over the value in the deprecated version, and the
current date is entered as the Revision Date of the new Registered
Performance Metric.[¶](#section-8.3-4){.pilcrow}

[Section 7.1.2](#name-sec7-1-2){.xref}. The Name Elements in each
Registry are case sensitive.[¶](#section-10.2-3){.pilcrow}

When preparing a Metric Entry for registration, the developer

Descriptions of these columns and additional information found in the
template for Registry Entries (categories and columns) are further

The Identifier 0 should be Reserved. The Registered Performance Metric
unique Identifier is an unbounded integer (range 0 to infinity). The
Identifier values from 64512 to 65535 are reserved for private or
experimental use, and the user may encounter overlapping uses. When
adding new Registered Performance Metrics to the Performance Metrics
Registry, IANA [SHOULD]{.bcp14} assign the lowest available Identifier
to the new Registered Performance Metric. If a Performance Metrics
Expert providing review determines that there is a reason to assign a
specific numeric Identifier, possibly leaving a temporary gap in the
numbering, then the Performance Metrics Expert [SHALL]{.bcp14} inform
IANA of this decision.[¶](#section-10.3-4){.pilcrow}

Names starting with the prefix \"Priv\_\" are reserved for private use
and are not considered for registration. The Name column entries are
further defined in [Section

perform the function), with links to referenced section(s) of an RFC or
another immutable document.[¶](#section-10.3-6){.pilcrow}

The Reference column will include an RFC number, an approved
specification designator from another standards body, or some other
immutable document.[¶](#section-10.3-7){.pilcrow}

New assignments for the Performance Metrics Registry will be
administered by IANA through the Specification Required policy

Extensions to the Performance Metrics Registry require IETF Standards
Action. Only one form of Registry extension is
envisaged:[¶](#section-10.3-9){.pilcrow}

-   [Adding columns, or both categories and columns, to accommodate
    unanticipated aspects of new measurements and metric
    categories.[¶](#section-10.3-10.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-10.3-10.1}

If the Performance Metrics Registry is extended in this way, the version
number of future entries complying with the extension [SHALL]{.bcp14} be
incremented (in either the unit or the tenths digit, depending on the
degree of extension).[¶](#section-10.3-11){.pilcrow}
