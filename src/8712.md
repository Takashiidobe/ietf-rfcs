# RFC 8712 {#rfcnum}

# The IETF-ISOC Relationship {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

This document summarizes the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) -
Internet Society (ISOC) relationship, following a major revision to the
structure of the IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA) in 2018.
The IASA was revised under a new \"IASA 2.0\" structure by the IASA2
Working Group, which changed the IETF\'s administrative, legal, and
financial structure. As a result, it also changed the relationship
between the IETF and ISOC, which made it necessary to revise RFC
2031.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

## [1.](#section-1){.section-number .selfRef} [Introduction and History](#name-introduction-and-history){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-introduction-and-history}

The Internet Society provides a corporate home for the administrative
entity that supports the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), the
Internet Architecture Board (IAB), and the Internet Research Task Force
(IRTF), and supports the work of these groups through a variety of
programs.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is the body that is
responsible for the development and maintenance of the Internet
Standards. The IETF is primarily a volunteer organization. Its driving
force is a group of dedicated, high-quality engineers from all over the
world. In a structure of working groups, these engineers exchange ideas
and experience, and through discussion and collaboration (both
electronically and face-to-face), they strive to achieve rough consensus
and implement the standards through running
code.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

The growth of the Internet over several decades has also led to the
growth of the IETF. More and more people, organizations, and companies
rely on Internet Standards. Nontechnical issues, such as legal,
administrative, and financial issues had long been an undesirable but
unavoidable part of the IETF. To address these issues, the IETF
established the Poised95 Working Group in 1995. Its goal was to
structure and document the IETF processes in order to maximize the
flexibility and freedom of IETF engineers so that they could work in the
way the IETF had always been most successful and to honor the IETF
credo: \"Rough consensus and running code\".[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

The Poised95 Working Group concluded that the Internet Society (ISOC),
which was formed in 1992, was the best organization to handle all of
these legal, administrative, and financial tasks on behalf of, and in
close cooperation with, the IETF. This led to documenting things such as
the IETF standards process \[[RFC2026](#RFC2026){.xref}\], the IETF
organizational structure \[[RFC2028](#RFC2028){.xref}\], the IETF
Nominating Committee (NomCom) procedures \[[RFC2027](#RFC2027){.xref}\],
and the IETF-ISOC relationship
\[[RFC2031](#RFC2031){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

As time passed and operational experience accumulated, additional
structure was necessary. As a result, the Internet Administrative
Support Activity (IASA) was defined in 2005 and documented in
\[[RFC4071](#RFC4071){.xref}\] and
\[[RFC4371](#RFC4371){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}

In 2018, the IASA was revised under a new \"IASA 2.0\" structure by the
IASA2 Working Group, which made significant revisions to the IETF\'s
administrative, legal, and financial structure. One critical outcome was
the formation, in close cooperation between the IETF and ISOC, of the
IETF Administration Limited Liability Company (IETF LLC) as a subsidiary
of ISOC.[¶](#section-1-6){.pilcrow}

As a result of the IASA 2.0 structure \[[RFC8711](#RFC8711){.xref}\] and
formation of the IETF LLC, the relationship between the IETF and ISOC
has changed. This document summarizes the current state of the IETF-ISOC
relationship at a high level and replaces
\[[RFC2031](#RFC2031){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-7){.pilcrow}
:::

::: {#section-2 .section}
## [2.](#section-2){.section-number .selfRef} [Philosophical Relationship with ISOC](#name-philosophical-relationship-){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-philosophical-relationship-}

ISOC and the IETF have historically been philosophically aligned.
ISOC\'s connection with the IETF community has always played an
important role in its policy work, which has not changed. ISOC has
always been and continues to be an advocate for multistakeholder
processes, which includes the technical community. Open standards are an
explicit part of one of the focus areas in ISOC\'s mission: advancing
the development and application of Internet infrastructure,
technologies, and open standards
\[[ISOC-Mission](#ISOC-Mission){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2-1){.pilcrow}

## [3.](#section-3){.section-number .selfRef} [Main Division of Responsibilities between IETF and ISOC](#name-main-division-of-responsibi){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-main-division-of-responsibi}

The IETF remains responsible for the development and quality of the
Internet Standards. Apart from the roles described below, the IETF and
ISOC acknowledge that ISOC as an organization has no direct influence
whatsoever on the technical content of Internet Standards (though ISOC
employees may independently continue to make technical contributions as
individuals).[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

## [4.](#section-4){.section-number .selfRef} [ISOC\'s Role in the IETF Standards Process](#name-isocs-role-in-the-ietf-stan){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-isocs-role-in-the-ietf-stan}

ISOC plays a small role in the IETF standards process. In particular,
ISOC assists the standards process by appointing the IETF NomCom chair
and by confirming IAB candidates who are put forward by the IETF NomCom,
as described in \[[RFC8713](#RFC8713){.xref}\], and by acting as the
last resort in the appeals process, as described in
\[[RFC2026](#RFC2026){.xref}\].[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

ISOC maintains liaison relationships and memberships in other Standards
Development Organizations (SDOs) and related organizations, which
directly benefits the IETF. For example, ISOC is a Sector Member of the
ITU-T. As a result, ISOC delegates are afforded the same rights as other
ITU-T Sector Members
\[[RFC6756](#RFC6756){.xref}\].[¶](#section-4-2){.pilcrow}

ISOC also supports the IETF standards process indirectly (e.g., by
promoting it in relevant communities) through several programs. For
example, ISOC\'s Policymakers Programme to the IETF (usually referred to
simply as ISOC\'s IETF Policy Program) gives policy experts an
opportunity to interact directly with the IETF technical community. ISOC
also performs technical work using the standards developed in the IETF
as its basis. An example of that is ISOC\'s work in encouraging and
supporting the deployment of IETF standards.[¶](#section-4-3){.pilcrow}

Otherwise, the involvement of ISOC\'s employees in the IETF standards
process (e.g., as document editors or in leadership positions) is as
individual contributors rather than on institutional
grounds.[¶](#section-4-4){.pilcrow}

The IETF plays a role in the governance of ISOC. Per ISOC\'s bylaws, the
IETF appoints a set of trustees to the ISOC Board. The process by which
the IETF makes those appointments is defined in
\[[RFC3677](#RFC3677){.xref}\].[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

The charter of the IAB (Internet Architecture Board)
\[[RFC2850](#RFC2850){.xref}\] states that \"the IAB acts as a source of
advice and guidance to the Board of Trustees and Officers of the
Internet Society concerning technical, architectural, procedural, and
(where appropriate) policy matters pertaining to the Internet and its
enabling technologies\". This connection between the IAB and ISOC
ensures that ISOC\'s proposals in the policy area are based on a sound
understanding of the relevant technologies and architectures. ISOC\'s
strong connection to the Internet technical community has always been
one of its main strengths.[¶](#section-5-2){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-6 .section}
## [6.](#section-6){.section-number .selfRef} [Legal Relationship with ISOC](#name-legal-relationship-with-iso){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-legal-relationship-with-iso}

The IETF LLC is a disregarded Limited Liability Company (LLC) of the
Internet Society that was established to provide a corporate legal
framework for facilitating current and future activities related to the
IETF, IAB, and IRTF. It was established by the ISOC / IETF LLC Agreement
\[[OpAgreement](#OpAgreement){.xref}\] on August 27, 2018, and governs
the relationship between the IETF LLC and
ISOC.[¶](#section-6-1){.pilcrow}

The IETF Trust, documented in \[[RFC5378](#RFC5378){.xref}\], and
updated in \[[RFC8714](#RFC8714){.xref}\] and
\[[RFC8715](#RFC8715){.xref}\], provides legal protection for the RFC
Series of documents and other aspects of the IETF. This includes things
such as protection for trademarks, copyrights, and intellectual property
rights. As part of the IETF Trust arrangement, IETF standards documents
can be freely downloaded, copied, and distributed without financial or
other distribution restrictions, though all rights to change these
documents lie with the IETF. The IETF Trust also provides legal
protection in case of disputes over intellectual property rights and
other rights. The creation of the IETF LLC has changed the way that the
IETF Trust\'s trustees are selected but did not change the purpose or
operation of the Trust. One of the IETF Trust\'s trustees is appointed
by the ISOC\'s Board of Trustees.[¶](#section-6-2){.pilcrow}

## [7.](#section-7){.section-number .selfRef} [Financial and Administrative Relationship with ISOC](#name-financial-and-administrativ){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-financial-and-administrativ}

Under the terms of the Operating Agreement
\[[OpAgreement](#OpAgreement){.xref}\] between ISOC and the IETF, ISOC
has agreed to provide significant funding support for the IETF. In
addition, the IETF LLC is responsible for creating and managing an
annual operating budget for the IETF; for negotiating, signing, and
overseeing contracts; for fundraising; for maintaining bank accounts;
and for liability insurance. The IETF LLC is managed by a Board of
Directors, one of whom is appointed by the ISOC\'s Board of Trustees.
The intention is that ISOC and the IETF LLC operate at arm\'s
length.[¶](#section-7-1){.pilcrow}

The IETF LLC establishes contracts with third parties to provide
different types of services to the IETF. Note that it is possible that
some of those services may be provided by ISOC or involve ISOC
staff.[¶](#section-7-2){.pilcrow}

Under the new IASA 2.0 structure, the IETF LLC is solely responsible for
its administration, including the IETF Trust, IAB, IESG, IETF working
groups, and other IETF processes. A further exploration of this can be
found in [Section
4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8711#section-4){.relref} of
