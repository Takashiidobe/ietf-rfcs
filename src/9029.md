# RFC 9029 {#rfcnum}

# Updates to the Allocation Policy for the Border Gateway Protocol - Link State (BGP-LS) Parameters Registries {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

RFC 7752 defines the Border Gateway Protocol - Link State (BGP-LS). IANA
created a registry consistent with that document called \"Border Gateway
Protocol - Link State (BGP-LS) Parameters\" with a number of
subregistries. The allocation policy applied by IANA for those
registries is \"Specification Required\", as defined in RFC
8126.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

This document updates RFC 7752 by changing the allocation policy for all
of the registries to \"Expert Review\" and by updating the guidance to
the designated experts.[¶](#section-abstract-2){.pilcrow}

\"North-Bound Distribution of Link-State and Traffic Engineering (TE)
Information Using BGP\" \[[RFC7752](#RFC7752){.xref}\] requested IANA to
create a registry called \"Border Gateway Protocol - Link State (BGP-LS)
Parameters\" with a number of subregistries. The allocation policy
applied by IANA for those registries is \"Specification Required\", as
defined in \[[RFC8126](#RFC8126){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

The \"Specification Required\" policy requires evaluation of any
assignment request by a \"designated expert\", and guidelines for any
such experts are given in [Section
5.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7752#section-5.1){.relref} of
\[[RFC7752](#RFC7752){.xref}\]. In addition, this policy requires that
\"the values and their meanings must be documented in a permanent and
readily available public specification, in sufficient detail so that
interoperability between independent implementations is possible\"
\[[RFC8126](#RFC8126){.xref}\]. Further, the intention behind
\"permanent and readily available\" is that \"a document can reasonably
be expected to be findable and retrievable long after IANA assignment of
the requested value\"
\[[RFC8126](#RFC8126){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

Another allocation policy called \"Expert Review\" is defined in
\[[RFC8126](#RFC8126){.xref}\]. This policy also requires Expert Review
but has no requirement for a formal document.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

All reviews by designated experts are guided by advice given in the
document that defined the registry and set the allocation
policy.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

This document updates \[[RFC7752](#RFC7752){.xref}\] by changing the
allocation policy for all of the registries to \"Expert Review\" and
updating the guidance to the designated
experts.[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}

IANA maintains a registry called \"Border Gateway Protocol - Link State
(BGP-LS) Parameters\". This registry contains four
subregistries:[¶](#section-2-1){.pilcrow}

-   [BGP-LS NLRI-Types[¶](#section-2-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-2-2.1}
-   [BGP-LS Protocol-IDs[¶](#section-2-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-2-2.2}

-   [BGP-LS Node Descriptor, Link Descriptor, Prefix Descriptor, and
    Attribute TLVs[¶](#section-2-2.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-2-2.4}

IANA has changed the assignment policy for each of these registries to
\"Expert Review\".[¶](#section-2-3){.pilcrow}

IANA has also added this document as a reference for the registries
mentioned above.[¶](#section-2-4){.pilcrow}

### [2.1.](#section-2.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Guidance for Designated Experts](#name-guidance-for-designated-exp){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-guidance-for-designated-exp}

[Section
5.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7752#section-5.1){.relref} of
\[[RFC7752](#RFC7752){.xref}\] gives guidance to designated experts.
This section replaces that guidance.[¶](#section-2.1-1){.pilcrow}

In all cases of review by the designated expert described here, the
designated expert is expected to check the clarity of purpose and use of
the requested code points. The following points apply to the registries
discussed in this document:[¶](#section-2.1-2){.pilcrow}

1.  [Application for a code point allocation may be made to the
    designated experts at any time and [MUST]{.bcp14} be accompanied by
    technical documentation explaining the use of the code point. Such
    documentation [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be presented in the form of an
    Internet-Draft but [MAY]{.bcp14} arrive in any form that can be
    reviewed and exchanged amongst
    reviewers.[¶](#section-2.1-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.1-3.1}
2.  [The designated experts [SHOULD]{.bcp14} only consider requests that
    arise from Internet-Drafts that have already been accepted as
    working group documents or that are planned for progression as
    AD-Sponsored documents in the absence of a suitably chartered
    working group.[¶](#section-2.1-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.1-3.2}
3.  [In the case of working group documents, the designated experts
    [MUST]{.bcp14} check with the working group chairs that there is
    consensus within the working group to make the allocation at this
    time. In the case of AD-Sponsored documents, the designated experts
    [MUST]{.bcp14} check with the AD for approval to make the allocation
    at this time.[¶](#section-2.1-3.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.1-3.3}
4.  [If the document is not adopted by the IDR Working Group (or its
    successor), the designated expert [MUST]{.bcp14} notify the IDR
    mailing list (or its successor) of the request and [MUST]{.bcp14}
    provide access to the document. The designated expert [MUST]{.bcp14}
    allow two weeks for any response. Any comments received
    [MUST]{.bcp14} be considered by the designated expert as part of the
    subsequent step.[¶](#section-2.1-3.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.1-3.4}
5.  [The designated experts [MUST]{.bcp14} then review the assignment
    requests on their technical merit. The designated experts
    [MAY]{.bcp14} raise issues related to the allocation request with
    the authors and on the IDR (or successor) mailing list for further
    consideration before the assignments are
    made.[¶](#section-2.1-3.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.1-3.5}
6.  [The designated expert [MUST]{.bcp14} ensure that any request for a
    code point does not conflict with work that is active or already
    published within the
    IETF.[¶](#section-2.1-3.6){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.1-3.6}
7.  [Once the designated experts have granted approval, IANA will update
    the registry by marking the allocated code points with a reference
    to the associated
    document.[¶](#section-2.1-3.7){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.1-3.7}
8.  [In the event that the document is a working group document or is AD
    Sponsored, and that document fails to progress to publication as an
    RFC, the working group chairs or AD [SHOULD]{.bcp14} contact IANA to
    coordinate about marking the code points as deprecated. A deprecated
    code point is not marked as allocated for use and is not available
    for allocation in a future document. The WG chairs may inform IANA
    that a deprecated code point can be completely deallocated (i.e.,
    made available for new allocations) at any time after it has been
    deprecated if there is a shortage of unallocated code points in the
    registry.[¶](#section-2.1-3.8){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.1-3.8}

## [3.](#section-3){.section-number .selfRef} [Security Considerations](#name-security-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-security-considerations}

The security considerations described in [Section
8](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7752#section-8){.relref} of
\[[RFC7752](#RFC7752){.xref}\] still apply.[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

Note that the change to the Expert Review guidelines makes the registry
and the designated experts slightly more vulnerable to denial-of-service
attacks through excessive and bogus requests for code points. It is
expected that the registry cannot be effectively attacked because the
designated experts would, themselves, fall to any such attack first.
Designated experts are expected to report to the IDR Working Group
chairs and responsible Area Director if they believe an attack to be in
progress and should immediately halt all requests for allocation. This
may temporarily block all legitimate requests until mitigations have
been put in place.[¶](#section-3-2){.pilcrow}
