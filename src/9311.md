# Running an IETF Hackathon {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

IETF Hackathons encourage the IETF community to collaborate on running
code related to existing and evolving Internet standards. This document
provides a set of practices that have been used for running IETF
Hackathons. These practices apply to Hackathons in which both in-person
and remote participation are possible, with adaptations for Hackathons
that are online only.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

IETF Hackathons encourage the IETF community to collaborate on running
code related to existing and evolving Internet standards. IETF
Hackathons aim to:[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

-   [advance the pace and relevance of IETF standards activities by
    bringing the speed and collaborative spirit of open source
    development into the
    IETF[¶](#section-1-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-2.1}
-   [bring developers and early career professionals into the IETF and
    get them exposed to and interested in the
    IETF[¶](#section-1-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-2.2}

IETF Hackathons are free to attend and open to everyone. Software
developers are the primary audience, but participation by subject-matter
experts who are not necessarily developers is encouraged and very
important as well. Similarly, while the Hackathon is meant to attract
newcomers and people who do not typically attend standards meetings,
long-time IETF contributors, including Internet-Draft authors, working
group chairs, and subject-matter experts, are key participants as well.
Collaboration and blending of skill sets and perspectives are extremely
valuable aspects of IETF Hackathons.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

In addition to the running code created and improved as a result of each
Hackathon, the exchange of ideas, extensions of human networks, and
establishment of trust, respect, and friendships are some of the most
valuable outputs of each Hackathon. Code written in a programming
language is often more illustrative and constructive than opinions
expressed during a meeting or in an email. Working together to find
common understanding of proposals, concerns, and solutions that result
in improvements to evolving Internet standards is as important as the
development of running code that implements or validates the correctness
of these same proposals.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

Consequently, IETF Hackathons are collaborative events, not
competitions. Any competitiveness among participants is friendly and in
the spirit of advancing the pace and relevance of new and evolving
Internet standards. IETF Hackathons are inclusive, not only in terms of
who can participate but also in terms of the projects included in each
Hackathon. All projects should be related to existing or proposed
Internet standards in some way. Examples include, but are not limited
to, interoperability of implementations, proof of concepts, and tools
that help implement, monitor, or deploy network
protocols.[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}

IETF Hackathons foster an open environment, with much of the code being
open source and results of projects typically shared publicly. The
Hackathon operates under the \[[NOTE-WELL](#NOTE-WELL){.xref}\];
however, the rules and terms around code are those of the license
associated with the code. Although code is often and preferably open
source, it may be proprietary as well.[¶](#section-1-6){.pilcrow}

This document provides a set of practices that have been used for
running IETF Hackathons.[¶](#section-1-7){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-2 .section}
## [2.](#section-2){.section-number .selfRef} [Timing](#name-timing){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-timing}

The first IETF Hackathon was held the weekend before the start of the
IETF 92 meeting. The rationale was to avoid conflicts yet make it
relatively convenient for those attending the IETF meeting to
participate in the Hackathon as well. Holding the Hackathon on the
weekend was also viewed as making it more accessible to those who are
not IETF meeting participants, including students and working
professionals who would have other commitments during the week. The
weekend before was viewed as better than the weekend after so that
things learned during the Hackathon could be shared and discussed with
the rest of the IETF community during working group sessions and the
like. This worked well at IETF 92, was repeated at IETF 93, and quickly
became an established norm with the IETF meeting being officially
extended to include the Hackathon at the start. An additional benefit of
this timing noted and appreciated by participants is that it serves as a
more informal and social way to physically and mentally acclimate to
changes in time zones and surroundings.[¶](#section-2-1){.pilcrow}

::: {#agenda}
::: {#section-2.1 .section}
### [2.1.](#section-2.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Agenda](#name-agenda){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-agenda}

The IETF Hackathon is a strenuous event. Though not a competition,
participants want to make the most of their time together, much as with
the IETF meeting in general. Competitive Hackathons typically run
nonstop for on the order of 40 hours. There is a strict deadline, teams
are judged, and winners are declared at the end. Afterward, participants
are wiped out and head off to briefly celebrate or commiserate but
mainly to recuperate. As the IETF Hackathon serves as the start of the
overall IETF meeting, we aim to strike a compromise that provides time
to get valuable work accomplished without exhausting everyone before the
main IETF meeting even starts. While some people participate in the
Hackathon only, the majority of people remain and plan to be actively
engaged in the rest of the IETF meeting.[¶](#section-2.1-1){.pilcrow}

The typical agenda is as follows:[¶](#section-2.1-2){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-2.1-3 .alignLeft .art-text .artwork}
    Saturday before IETF meeting week
        08:30: Room open for setup by project champions
        09:00: Room open for all - pastries and coffee provided
        09:30: Hackathon kickoff
        09:45: Form teams
        12:30: Lunch provided
        15:30: Afternoon break - snacks provided
        19:00: Dinner provided
        22:00: Room closes

    Sunday before IETF meeting week
        08:30: Room opens - pastries and coffee provided
        12:30: Lunch provided
        13:30: Hacking stops; prepare brief presentation of project
               results
        14:00: Present project results to other participants
        15:45: Closing remarks and opportunities for next time
        16:00: Hackathon ends
        17:00: Tear down complete

[¶](#section-2.1-3){.pilcrow}
:::

The time on Saturday morning provides the opportunity for team champions
to set up and participants to socialize and learn more about projects
and teams they might want to join. The kickoff presentation and
formalities are kept to a minimum to leave as much time as possible for
teams to work together on their projects. The proximity of teams fosters
communication and collaboration between them as
well.[¶](#section-2.1-4){.pilcrow}

Lunch and dinner are provided as a convenience and an incentive to
remain at the Hackathon. Participants are free to come and go as they
like. It is well understood and accepted that there are other things
vying for time and that meeting with friends and colleagues outside of
the Hackathon is an entirely reasonable thing to
do.[¶](#section-2.1-5){.pilcrow}

The room closes Saturday evening to give hotel staff unfettered access
to the room and to encourage people to pace and take care of themselves.
There are no rules against continuing work on projects outside of the
Hackathon room. Similarly, working on projects long before and after the
Hackathon is allowed and encouraged.[¶](#section-2.1-6){.pilcrow}

The end of the Hackathon on Sunday is driven by other IETF meeting
events. Typically, there are Newcomer events that start at 16:00. The
IETF Hackathon typically includes many newcomers in its list of
participants, and it is important to provide them time to participate in
the Newcomer events. The opening reception for the IETF typically starts
at 17:00, and we want to make it easy for all Hackathon participants to
join that as well.[¶](#section-2.1-7){.pilcrow}

[Hackdemo Happy Hour](#hackdemo-happy-hour){.xref} ([Section
2.2](#hackdemo-happy-hour){.xref}) and the [Code
Lounge](#code-lounge){.xref} ([Section 2.3](#code-lounge){.xref}) exist
to facilitate ongoing discussion and work on projects beyond the
official end of the Hackathon weekend.[¶](#section-2.1-8){.pilcrow}

### [2.2.](#section-2.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Hackdemo Happy Hour](#name-hackdemo-happy-hour){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-hackdemo-happy-hour}

Hackdemo Happy Hour provides an opportunity for more in-depth sharing
and discussion than is possible within the time constraints of the
results presentations that occur at the end of the Hackathon. This
opportunity is made available to all teams. As with the results
presentations, participation is optional.[¶](#section-2.2-1){.pilcrow}

Initially, something similar was done as part of
\[[BITS-N-BITES](#BITS-N-BITES){.xref}\]. This worked well for the
Hackathon, but the Bits-N-Bites event was eventually abandoned for other
reasons. Hackdemo Happy Hour was created as a low-cost, informal event
to provide a venue for the IETF community to engage with the Hackathon
teams in more in-depth discussions related to their
projects.[¶](#section-2.2-2){.pilcrow}

Hackdemo Happy Hour is typically Monday evening, roughly from 18:00 -

The Code Lounge provides space for groups to gather and continue to

IETF Lounge and open the same hours as the IETF Lounge. Champions are
encouraged to look at the final agenda and determine which time slots
are best suited to ensure attendance of Code Lounge sessions, as well as
any related working group sessions. It is okay for multiple teams to
sign up for the same time slots. This is in fact encouraged for work
that spans multiple working groups or

The \[[CODE-SPRINT](#CODE-SPRINT){.xref}\] develops tools that support
the work of the IETF. The Code Sprint existed long before the Hackathon
and benefited from being a focused event in a quiet space with few
interruptions. However, there is a great deal of synergy between the
Code Sprint and the Hackathon, and they attract some of the same
participants. For example, some Hackathon projects, such as those
related to YANG model validation, involve the creation or modification
of IETF tools. It is therefore advantageous to co-locate these two
events when practical and, when separate space is deemed helpful, to
allocate spaces that are physically close to each other to make it easy
for participants to switch back and forth between the two
events.[¶](#section-2.4-1){.pilcrow}

The IETF 107 Hackathon was originally scheduled to be the weekend at the
start of the IETF meeting in Vancouver. When COVID-19 hit and it became
clear the IETF meeting could not occur in person, the Hackathon already
had 23 projects and 176 registrations. With only 10 days until the
anticipated start of the Hackathon, a \[[SURVEY](#SURVEY){.xref}\] went
out to the Hackathon community, including all project champions and
registered participants, to see if they wanted to participate in the
Hackathon exactly as planned except with everyone participating remotely
rather than in person. A relatively small number of people expressed
interest in participating, with even fewer wanting to continue to
champion their projects. The fact that the Hackathon was planned for the
weekend before the IETF meeting and in the local time zone, both of
which were historically very convenient and attractive to Hackathon
participants, suddenly became huge obstacles. Consequently, the IETF 107
Hackathon was canceled.[¶](#section-2.5-1){.pilcrow}

We knew more in advance that IETF 108 would be an online-only meeting.
We moved and expanded the schedule to run the entire work week before
the rest of the IETF meeting. The Hackathon kickoff was set for Monday
and the closing set for Friday, with all the time in between left for
individual project teams to arrange to meet how and when was most
convenient for them. The kickoff and closing sessions were scheduled to
align with the time frame established for the IETF 108 meeting. All of
this was, of course, not ideal, and it worked much better for some
people than for others, but at least everyone knew the plan and
corresponding time commitment well in advance and had the ability to
plan accordingly.[¶](#section-2.5-2){.pilcrow}

We ultimately had 19 projects and almost 300 registrations. It is hard
to say how many people actually participated and for how long, but many
were able to get substantial work done on their projects. For the
closing, 10 teams produced and shared presentations summarizing their
findings and achievements. All results presentations, as well as the
agenda and a recording of the closing session, are available via the
\[[IETF-108-HACKATHON-WIKI](#IETF-108-HACKATHON-WIKI){.xref}\]. This
level of participation was strong enough to be considered a success and
justifies including the Hackathon in future online-only IETF
meetings.[¶](#section-2.5-3){.pilcrow}

The initial funding model was to have Hackathon sponsors sign up to
sponsor and fund the Hackathon for one year. As part of starting the
Hackathon, Cisco volunteered to sponsor and fund it for the first year
(i.e., three Hackathons, one at each IETF meeting during a calendar
year). This sponsorship was to rotate. Huawei volunteered to sponsor the
second year of the Hackathon. After the second year, a sponsor for the
third year was not found. However, the Hackathon had become a proven
success. Consequently, the IETF decided to fund the Hackathon as part of
the IETF meeting, with Hackathon sponsorship being on a best-effort
basis.[¶](#section-3.1-1){.pilcrow}

Online-only Hackathons in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and
increased remote participating in general result in increased cloud
infrastructure requirements that make Hackathon sponsorship more
attractive to cloud infrastructure
providers.[¶](#section-3.1-2){.pilcrow}

The primary expenses associated with the Hackathon are those for hosting
an in-person event, e.g., meeting space, food and beverage, etc. It is
often challenging to quantify what portions of this are associated with
the Hackathon versus what is incurred for the IETF meeting
overall.[¶](#section-3.2-1){.pilcrow}

The meeting space for the Hackathon is sometimes included as part of the
overall contract for the IETF meeting. Other times, an additional
expense is incurred to secure a large enough space earlier than would
otherwise have been required. Typically, the space is needed for setup
from Friday afternoon before the start of the IETF meeting until Sunday
afternoon. After the Hackathon, the space is typically repurposed for
the IETF Lounge. If the size of the Hackathon continues to increase, it
might be necessary to use the same space as is later used for the IETF
plenary.[¶](#section-3.2.1.1-1){.pilcrow}

Project presentations are an important mechanism for capturing what each

and sharing the results and findings with the IETF

For the first few Hackathons, we had two very distinct types of
presentations:[¶](#section-4-2){.pilcrow}

1.  [presentations that served as project pitches at the start of the

### [4.1.](#section-4.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Project Pitches](#name-project-pitches){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-project-pitches}

The project pitches were 5-10 minute presentations by a champion of a
project describing what they wanted to do and how they proposed to
accomplish it. This gave everyone in the room a better understanding of
all the projects and helped participants match themselves with
appropriate projects. This worked well when we had few projects, but it
became unwieldy as the number of projects increased. As knowledge of the
Hackathon grew and advanced planning became more common, many
participants knew exactly which team they planned to join and wanted to
get to work as quickly as possible rather than spend time listening to
presentations. Project pitches were dropped from the Hackathon.
Champions are encouraged to share this type of information in advance
via the [IETF Meeting Wiki](#meeting-wiki){.xref} ([Section

The project results presentations were brief presentations by each team
of what problem they tried to solve, what they achieved, and highlights
that included lessons learned, feedback to associated working groups,
and collaboration with open source communities and other standards
organizations. They also highlight individuals who participated in their
first IETF Hackathon or first IETF event, which helps facilitate the
introduction of such individuals to the IETF community. The production
and presentation of summaries of results is optional. Fortunately,
despite the lack of awards and prizes, most teams
participate.[¶](#section-4.2-1){.pilcrow}

As with the project pitches, project results presentations can become
unwieldy as the number of projects increases. With this in mind, the
total time for all results presentations is limited to 2 hours. The
maximum duration of each presentation is calculated based on the number
of teams that indicate the desire to present. This maximum is strictly
enforced to ensure all teams have the opportunity to present their
results. Maximum durations of 3-5 minutes are
typical.[¶](#section-4.2-2){.pilcrow}

### [5.8.](#section-5.8){.section-number .selfRef} [Network](#name-network){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-network}

Access to the IETF network is an important aspect of the Hackathon. The
IETF network provides unfettered Internet access that is not typical
within many residential, corporate, and university environments. For
many IETF participants and projects, access to the Internet and each
other via wireless access to the IETF network is sufficient. However,
due to the nature of the work done in the IETF, wired access and special
networking capabilities are often required.[¶](#section-5.8-1){.pilcrow}

The Network Operations Center (NOC) has graciously met the needs of the
Hackathon since its inception and continues to add more capabilities
over time. In advance, champions are able to request wired access and
special networking functionality, including static IPv4 and IPv6
addresses, IPv6-only networking, a closed user group, Network Address
and Protocol Translation from IPv6 Clients to IPv4 Servers (NAT64), and
IPv6 Prefix Delegation. All of this, and the IETF network in general, is
made available by the start of the Hackathon and in advance for setup to
the extent possible.[¶](#section-5.8-2){.pilcrow}

#### [5.8.1.](#section-5.8.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Remote Networking](#name-remote-networking){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-remote-networking}

Online-only meetings present both a personal-networking challenge and a
computer-networking challenge. The NOC came to the rescue for the latter
with an experimental mechanism that was used to join the IETF network
while attending a meeting remotely. This evolved into what is now known
as \"HackNet\" \[[HACKNET](#HACKNET){.xref}\], a global Layer 2 VPN
designed to support IETF protocol development across teams within the
IETF Hackathon. A limited set of devices for connecting to HackNet are
supported. In addition to Layer 2 connectivity, a subset of the
networking capabilities available at in-person meetings are available.
Both the set of devices and the set of networking capabilities are
expected to expand and evolve over time. However, it is important to
note that HackNet is still an experiment and not a production service.
Best-effort support is available via email to
\<support\@ietf.org>.[¶](#section-5.8.1-1){.pilcrow}

Champions can request a \[[WEBEX-ACCOUNT](#WEBEX-ACCOUNT){.xref}\] they

Webex accounts that are allocated to and used by the working group
chairs for virtual interim meetings. An account can be requested by a
team champion at any time. Accounts remain active and available

meeting. A project name may be used in place of \"Working Group Name\"
in the request form.[¶](#section-5.9-1){.pilcrow}

\[[GATHER](#GATHER){.xref}\] facilitates virtual hallway interaction
during IETF meetings. A dedicated area within the overall space is
created by the Secretariat for the Hackathon. The area includes tables,
identified by letters of the alphabet, that teams are free to
self-assign and use as and when they like. Eight to ten seats around
each table facilitate group discussions within the team. A dry erase
board or shared notes tablet, e.g., \[[HEDGEDOC](#HEDGEDOC){.xref}\], at
tables facilitates sharing of information within the team. The tables
also facilitate collaboration across teams. One cautionary note: Gather
has relative high-network bandwidth and CPU requirements and, as such,
may not be well suited for some Hackathon
participants.[¶](#section-5.10-1){.pilcrow}

The Gather space remains available between IETF meetings, with
incremental improvements and additions made during this time. The space
is cleaned about a month prior to the start of the next meeting,
removing anything left over from the previous meeting. Hackathon teams
are encouraged to make a copy of anything they want to retain within a
week of the end of the IETF meeting.[¶](#section-5.10-2){.pilcrow}

## [6.](#section-6){.section-number .selfRef} [Statistics and Metrics](#name-statistics-and-metrics){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-statistics-and-metrics}

Statistics for the Hackathon have been gathered informally from the
first Hackathon, at IETF 92, and more formally since IETF 101.
Registration is required, but it is also free, which can lead to
misleading statistics. Starting with IETF 101, an effort has been made
by the Secretariat to validate registrations for all in-person
participants by checking registrations at the main entrance to the
Hackathon room. Badges similar to those issued for the rest of the IETF
meeting are now issued for the Hackathon as well. There is still no good
mechanism for determining the number of remote
participants.[¶](#section-6-1){.pilcrow}

Hackathon participation has grown from 45 participants at IETF 92 to a
maximum of 406 participants at IETF 104. Participation tends to be
slightly higher when the IETF meeting is located in Europe. Recent
in-person Hackathons have had roughly 30-40% as many participants as the
corresponding IETF meeting. For roughly 20-30% of Hackathon
participants, the Hackathon is their first experience at any IETF
event.[¶](#section-6-2){.pilcrow}

### [7.6.](#section-7.6){.section-number .selfRef} [Judges](#name-judges){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-judges}

The first several Hackathons involved judges who listened to project
results presentations by teams at the closing of each Hackathon and
identified winning teams for an arbitrary number of project categories.
Prizes were made available to members of winning teams. This was done as
an incentive to participate in the Hackathon and present results and to
provide a fun yet informative end to the Hackathon that could be
appreciated by the entire IETF community. Judging and the awarding of
prizes led to confusion regarding the nature of the Hackathon, making it
appear overly competitive to some. Procurement of appropriate prizes was
financially and logistically challenging. The arrangement of judges,
determination of winners, and awarding of prizes all became more time
consuming, especially as the number of projects and participants grew.
Ultimately, it was deemed best to eliminate judging, awards, and prizes
entirely. Apparently, the IETF community has an innate incentive to
participate and present results in the
Hackathon.[¶](#section-7.6-1){.pilcrow}

[HackNet](#remote-networking){.xref} ([Section
5.8.1](#remote-networking){.xref}) enables Hackathon participants to
join the IETF network while attending a meeting remotely. The intent is
for those connecting remotely to have as open a network as possible,
just like those connecting to the IETF network at an in-person meeting.
A user must have a Datatracker account to access HackNet and is expected
to respect it, just as they are expected to respect the IETF network at
an in-person meeting. If HackNet is exploited, it is addressed in the
same manner as an exploitation of the IETF network would be at an
in-person meeting.[¶](#section-9-1){.pilcrow}

The Hackathon complies with the IETF/IRTF/IAB
\[[PRIVACY-STATEMENT](#PRIVACY-STATEMENT){.xref}\].[¶](#section-9.1-1){.pilcrow}

Participant names are displayed publicly in the [Participant
List](#participant-list){.xref} ([Section
5.3.1](#participant-list){.xref}). As part of their registration,
participants may opt in to display their email address as
well.[¶](#section-9.1-2){.pilcrow}

The email addresses of individual champions are often shared publicly by
the champions on the wiki. This is done voluntarily by individual
champions to make it easier for others to contact
them.[¶](#section-9.1-3){.pilcrow}

Photos taken during the Hackathon, and during the IETF meeting in
general, are sometimes included in blog posts or on social media. Red
lanyards are made available to Hackathon participants to wear to
indicate that they do not wish to be photographed individually or in
small groups.[¶](#section-9.1-4){.pilcrow}

The IETF Secretariat, notably [Alexa Morris]{.contact-name} and
[Stephanie McCammon]{.contact-name}, contributed significantly to the
creation of the IETF Hackathon and the practices in this document. Among
other things, [Alexa]{.contact-name} drafted the initial breakdown of
[\"Roles and Responsibilities\"](#roles-and-responsibilities){.xref}
([Section 7](#roles-and-responsibilities){.xref}), and
[Stephanie]{.contact-name} created the initial Hackathon website and
wiki. These have evolved over time and are used to run each
Hackathon.[¶](#appendix-A-1){.pilcrow}
