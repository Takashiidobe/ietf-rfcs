# RFC 9110 {#rfcnum}

# HTTP Semantics {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a stateless application-level
protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information systems.
This document describes the overall architecture of HTTP, establishes
common terminology, and defines aspects of the protocol that are shared
by all versions. In this definition are core protocol elements,
extensibility mechanisms, and the \"http\" and \"https\" Uniform
Resource Identifier (URI) schemes.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

This document updates RFC 3864 and obsoletes RFCs 2818, 7231, 7232,
7233, 7235, 7538, 7615, 7694, and portions of
7230.[¶](#section-abstract-2){.pilcrow}

### [1.1.](#section-1.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Purpose](#name-purpose){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-purpose}

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a family of stateless,
application-level, request/response protocols that share a generic
interface, extensible semantics, and self-descriptive messages to enable
flexible interaction with network-based hypertext information
systems.[¶](#section-1.1-1){.pilcrow}

HTTP hides the details of how a service is implemented by presenting a
uniform interface to clients that is independent of the types of
resources provided. Likewise, servers do not need to be aware of each
client\'s purpose: a request can be considered in isolation rather than
being associated with a specific type of client or a predetermined
sequence of application steps. This allows general-purpose
implementations to be used effectively in many different contexts,
reduces interaction complexity, and enables independent evolution over
time.[¶](#section-1.1-2){.pilcrow}

HTTP is also designed for use as an intermediation protocol, wherein
proxies and gateways can translate non-HTTP information systems into a
more generic interface.[¶](#section-1.1-3){.pilcrow}

One consequence of this flexibility is that the protocol cannot be
defined in terms of what occurs behind the interface. Instead, we are
limited to defining the syntax of communication, the intent of received
communication, and the expected behavior of recipients. If the
communication is considered in isolation, then successful actions ought
to be reflected in corresponding changes to the observable interface
provided by servers. However, since multiple clients might act in
parallel and perhaps at cross-purposes, we cannot require that such
changes be observable beyond the scope of a single
response.[¶](#section-1.1-4){.pilcrow}

HTTP has been the primary information transfer protocol for the World
Wide Web since its introduction in 1990. It began as a trivial mechanism
for low-latency requests, with a single method (GET) to request transfer
of a presumed hypertext document identified by a given pathname. As the
Web grew, HTTP was extended to enclose requests and responses within
messages, transfer arbitrary data formats using MIME-like media types,
and route requests through intermediaries. These protocols were
eventually defined as HTTP/0.9 and HTTP/1.0 (see
\[[HTTP/1.0](#HTTP10){.xref}\]).[¶](#section-1.2-1){.pilcrow}

HTTP/1.1 was designed to refine the protocol\'s features while retaining
compatibility with the existing text-based messaging syntax, improving
its interoperability, scalability, and robustness across the Internet.
This included length-based data delimiters for both fixed and dynamic
(chunked) content, a consistent framework for content negotiation,
opaque validators for conditional requests, cache controls for better
cache consistency, range requests for partial updates, and default
persistent connections. HTTP/1.1 was introduced in 1995 and published on
the Standards Track in 1997 \[[RFC2068](#RFC2068){.xref}\], revised in
1999 \[[RFC2616](#RFC2616){.xref}\], and revised again in 2014
(\[[RFC7230](#RFC7230){.xref}\] through
\[[RFC7235](#RFC7235){.xref}\]).[¶](#section-1.2-2){.pilcrow}

HTTP/2 (\[[HTTP/2](#HTTP2){.xref}\]) introduced a multiplexed session
layer on top of the existing TLS and TCP protocols for exchanging
concurrent HTTP messages with efficient field compression and server
push. HTTP/3 (\[[HTTP/3](#HTTP3){.xref}\]) provides greater independence
for concurrent messages by using QUIC as a secure multiplexed transport
over UDP instead of TCP.[¶](#section-1.2-3){.pilcrow}

All three major versions of HTTP rely on the semantics defined by this
document. They have not obsoleted each other because each one has
specific benefits and limitations depending on the context of use.
Implementations are expected to choose the most appropriate transport
and messaging syntax for their particular
context.[¶](#section-1.2-4){.pilcrow}

This revision of HTTP separates the definition of semantics (this
document) and caching (\[[CACHING](#CACHING){.xref}\]) from the current
HTTP/1.1 messaging syntax (\[[HTTP/1.1](#HTTP11){.xref}\]) to allow each
major protocol version to progress independently while referring to the
same core semantics.[¶](#section-1.2-5){.pilcrow}

HTTP provides a uniform interface for interacting with a resource
([Section 3.1](#resources){.xref}) \-- regardless of its type, nature,
or implementation \-- by sending messages that manipulate or transfer
representations ([Section
3.2](#representations){.xref}).[¶](#section-1.3-1){.pilcrow}

Each message is either a request or a response. A client constructs
request messages that communicate its intentions and routes those
messages toward an identified origin server. A server listens for
requests, parses each message received, interprets the message semantics
in relation to the identified target resource, and responds to that
request with one or more response messages. The client examines received
responses to see if its intentions were carried out, determining what to
do next based on the status codes and content
received.[¶](#section-1.3-2){.pilcrow}

HTTP semantics include the intentions defined by each request method
([Section 9](#methods){.xref}), extensions to those semantics that might
be described in request header fields, status codes that describe the
response ([Section 15](#status.codes){.xref}), and other control data
and resource metadata that might be given in response
fields.[¶](#section-1.3-3){.pilcrow}

[]{#iref-content-negotiation-1 .iref} Semantics also include
representation metadata that describe how content is intended to be
interpreted by a recipient, request header fields that might influence
content selection, and the various selection algorithms that are
collectively referred to as \"content negotiation\" ([Section
12](#content.negotiation){.xref}).[¶](#section-1.3-4){.pilcrow}

This specification targets conformance criteria according to the role of
a participant in HTTP communication. Hence, requirements are placed on
senders, recipients, clients, servers, user agents, intermediaries,
origin servers, proxies, gateways, or caches, depending on what behavior
is being constrained by the requirement. Additional requirements are
placed on implementations, resource owners, and protocol element
registrations when they apply beyond the scope of a single
communication.[¶](#section-2.2-2){.pilcrow}

The verb \"generate\" is used instead of \"send\" where a requirement
applies only to implementations that create the protocol element, rather
than an implementation that forwards a received element
downstream.[¶](#section-2.2-3){.pilcrow}

An implementation is considered conformant if it complies with all of
the requirements associated with the roles it partakes in
HTTP.[¶](#section-2.2-4){.pilcrow}

A sender [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} generate protocol elements that do not match
the grammar defined by the corresponding ABNF rules. Within a given
message, a sender [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} generate protocol elements or
syntax alternatives that are only allowed to be generated by
participants in other roles (i.e., a role that the sender does not have
for that message).[¶](#section-2.2-5){.pilcrow}

Conformance to HTTP includes both conformance to the particular
messaging syntax of the protocol version in use and conformance to the
semantics of protocol elements sent. For example, a client that claims
conformance to HTTP/1.1 but fails to recognize the features required of
HTTP/1.1 recipients will fail to interoperate with servers that adjust
their responses in accordance with those claims. Features that reflect
user choices, such as content negotiation and user-selected extensions,
can impact application behavior beyond the protocol stream; sending
protocol elements that inaccurately reflect a user\'s choices will
confuse the user and inhibit choice.[¶](#section-2.2-6){.pilcrow}

When an implementation fails semantic conformance, recipients of that
implementation\'s messages will eventually develop workarounds to adjust
their behavior accordingly. A recipient [MAY]{.bcp14} employ such
workarounds while remaining conformant to this protocol if the
workarounds are limited to the implementations at fault. For example,
servers often scan portions of the User-Agent field value, and user
agents often scan the Server field value, to adjust their own behavior
with respect to known bugs or poorly chosen
defaults.[¶](#section-2.2-7){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-2.3 .section}
### [2.3.](#section-2.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Length Requirements](#name-length-requirements){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-length-requirements}

A recipient [SHOULD]{.bcp14} parse a received protocol element
defensively, with only marginal expectations that the element will
conform to its ABNF grammar and fit within a reasonable buffer
size.[¶](#section-2.3-1){.pilcrow}

HTTP does not have specific length limitations for many of its protocol
elements because the lengths that might be appropriate will vary widely,
depending on the deployment context and purpose of the implementation.
Hence, interoperability between senders and recipients depends on shared
expectations regarding what is a reasonable length for each protocol
element. Furthermore, what is commonly understood to be a reasonable
length for some protocol elements has changed over the course of the
past three decades of HTTP use and is expected to continue changing in
the future.[¶](#section-2.3-2){.pilcrow}

At a minimum, a recipient [MUST]{.bcp14} be able to parse and process
protocol element lengths that are at least as long as the values that it
generates for those same protocol elements in other messages. For
example, an origin server that publishes very long URI references to its
own resources needs to be able to parse and process those same
references when received as a target URI.[¶](#section-2.3-3){.pilcrow}

Many received protocol elements are only parsed to the extent necessary
to identify and forward that element downstream. For example, an
intermediary might parse a received field into its field name and field
value components, but then forward the field without further parsing
inside the field value.[¶](#section-2.3-4){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-2.4 .section}
### [2.4.](#section-2.4){.section-number .selfRef} [Error Handling](#name-error-handling){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-error-handling}

A recipient [MUST]{.bcp14} interpret a received protocol element
according to the semantics defined for it by this specification,
including extensions to this specification, unless the recipient has
determined (through experience or configuration) that the sender
incorrectly implements what is implied by those semantics. For example,
an origin server might disregard the contents of a received
[Accept-Encoding](#field.accept-encoding){.xref} header field if
inspection of the [User-Agent](#field.user-agent){.xref} header field
indicates a specific implementation version that is known to fail on
receipt of certain content codings.[¶](#section-2.4-1){.pilcrow}

Unless noted otherwise, a recipient [MAY]{.bcp14} attempt to recover a
usable protocol element from an invalid construct. HTTP does not define
specific error handling mechanisms except when they have a direct impact
on security, since different applications of the protocol require
different error handling strategies. For example, a Web browser might
wish to transparently recover from a response where the
[Location](#field.location){.xref} header field doesn\'t parse according
to the ABNF, whereas a systems control client might consider any form of
error recovery to be dangerous.[¶](#section-2.4-2){.pilcrow}

an underlying connection failure, as described in [Section

### [2.5.](#section-2.5){.section-number .selfRef} [Protocol Version](#name-protocol-version){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-protocol-version}

HTTP\'s version number consists of two decimal digits separated by a
\".\" (period or decimal point). The first digit (major version)
indicates the messaging syntax, whereas the second digit (minor version)
indicates the highest minor version within that major version to which
the sender is conformant (able to understand for future
communication).[¶](#section-2.5-1){.pilcrow}

While HTTP\'s core semantics don\'t change between protocol versions,
their expression \"on the wire\" can change, and so the HTTP version
number changes when incompatible changes are made to the wire format.
Additionally, HTTP allows incremental, backwards-compatible changes to
be made to the protocol without changing its version through the use of
defined extension points ([Section
16](#extending){.xref}).[¶](#section-2.5-2){.pilcrow}

The protocol version as a whole indicates the sender\'s conformance with
the set of requirements laid out in that version\'s corresponding
specification(s). For example, the version \"HTTP/1.1\" is defined by
the combined specifications of this document, \"HTTP Caching\"
\[[CACHING](#CACHING){.xref}\], and \"HTTP/1.1\"
\[[HTTP/1.1](#HTTP11){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2.5-3){.pilcrow}

HTTP\'s major version number is incremented when an incompatible message
syntax is introduced. The minor number is incremented when changes made
to the protocol have the effect of adding to the message semantics or
implying additional capabilities of the
sender.[¶](#section-2.5-4){.pilcrow}

The minor version advertises the sender\'s communication capabilities
even when the sender is only using a backwards-compatible subset of the
protocol, thereby letting the recipient know that more advanced features
can be used in response (by servers) or in future requests (by
clients).[¶](#section-2.5-5){.pilcrow}

When a major version of HTTP does not define any minor versions, the
minor version \"0\" is implied. The \"0\" is used when referring to that
protocol within elements that require a minor version
identifier.[¶](#section-2.5-6){.pilcrow}

HTTP was created for the World Wide Web (WWW) architecture and has

hypertext system. Much of that architecture is reflected in the
terminology used to define HTTP.[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

[]{#iref-resource-14 .iref}

The target of an HTTP request is called a \"resource\". HTTP does not
limit the nature of a resource; it merely defines an interface that
might be used to interact with resources. Most resources are identified
by a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), as described in [Section
4](#uri){.xref}.[¶](#section-3.1-1){.pilcrow}

One design goal of HTTP is to separate resource identification from
request semantics, which is made possible by vesting the request
semantics in the request method ([Section 9](#methods){.xref}) and a few
request-modifying header fields. A resource cannot treat a request in a
manner inconsistent with the semantics of the method of the request. For
example, though the URI of a resource might imply semantics that are not
safe, a client can expect the resource to avoid actions that are unsafe
when processing a request with a safe method (see [Section
9.2.1](#safe.methods){.xref}).[¶](#section-3.1-2){.pilcrow}

HTTP relies upon the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) standard
\[[URI](#URI){.xref}\] to indicate the target resource ([Section
7.1](#target.resource){.xref}) and relationships between
resources.[¶](#section-3.1-3){.pilcrow}

### [3.2.](#section-3.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Representations](#name-representations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-representations}

[]{#iref-representation-15 .iref}

A \"representation\" is information that is intended to reflect a past,
current, or desired state of a given resource, in a format that can be
readily communicated via the protocol. A representation consists of a
set of representation metadata and a potentially unbounded stream of
representation data ([Section
8](#representation.data.and.metadata){.xref}).[¶](#section-3.2-1){.pilcrow}

HTTP allows \"information hiding\" behind its uniform interface by
defining communication with respect to a transferable representation of
the resource state, rather than transferring the resource itself. This
allows the resource identified by a URI to be anything, including
temporal functions like \"the current weather in Laguna Beach\", while
potentially providing information that represents that resource at the
time a message is generated
\[[REST](#REST){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3.2-2){.pilcrow}

The uniform interface is similar to a window through which one can
observe and act upon a thing only through the communication of messages
to an independent actor on the other side. A shared abstraction is
needed to represent (\"take the place of\") the current or desired state
of that thing in our communications. When a representation is hypertext,
it can provide both a representation of the resource state and
processing instructions that help guide the recipient\'s future
interactions.[¶](#section-3.2-3){.pilcrow}

::: {#selected.representation}
[]{#iref-selected-representation-16 .iref} A [target
resource](#target.resource){.xref} might be provided with, or be capable
of generating, multiple representations that are each intended to
reflect the resource\'s current state. An algorithm, usually based on
[content negotiation](#content.negotiation){.xref} ([Section
12](#content.negotiation){.xref}), would be used to select one of those
representations as being most applicable to a given request. This
\"selected representation\" provides the data and metadata for
evaluating conditional requests ([Section
13](#conditional.requests){.xref}) and constructing the content for [200
(OK)](#status.200){.xref}, [206 (Partial Content)](#status.206){.xref},

[]{#iref-client-17 .iref} []{#iref-server-18 .iref}

HTTP is a client/server protocol that operates over a reliable
transport- or session-layer \"connection\".[¶](#section-3.3-1){.pilcrow}

An HTTP \"client\" is a program that establishes a connection to a
server for the purpose of sending one or more HTTP requests. An HTTP
\"server\" is a program that accepts connections in order to service
HTTP requests by sending HTTP responses.[¶](#section-3.3-2){.pilcrow}

The terms client and server refer only to the roles that these programs
perform for a particular connection. The same program might act as a
client on some connections and a server on
others.[¶](#section-3.3-3){.pilcrow}

HTTP is defined as a stateless protocol, meaning that each request
message\'s semantics can be understood in isolation, and that the
relationship between connections and messages on them has no impact on
the interpretation of those messages. For example, a CONNECT request
([Section 9.3.6](#CONNECT){.xref}) or a request with the Upgrade header
field ([Section 7.8](#field.upgrade){.xref}) can occur at any time, not
just in the first message on a connection. Many implementations depend
on HTTP\'s stateless design in order to reuse proxied connections or
dynamically load balance requests across multiple
servers.[¶](#section-3.3-4){.pilcrow}

As a result, a server [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} assume that two requests on the
same connection are from the same user agent unless the connection is
secured and specific to that agent. Some non-standard HTTP extensions
(e.g., \[[RFC4559](#RFC4559){.xref}\]) have been known to violate this
requirement, resulting in security and interoperability
problems.[¶](#section-3.3-5){.pilcrow}

HTTP is a stateless request/response protocol for exchanging
\"messages\" across a [connection](#connections){.xref}. The terms
\"sender\" and \"recipient\" refer to any implementation that sends or
receives a given message, respectively.[¶](#section-3.4-1){.pilcrow}

A client sends requests to a server in the form of a \"request\" message
with a method ([Section 9](#methods){.xref}) and request target
([Section 7.1](#target.resource){.xref}). The request might also contain
header fields ([Section 6.3](#header.fields){.xref}) for request
modifiers, client information, and representation metadata, content
([Section 6.4](#content){.xref}) intended for processing in accordance
with the method, and trailer fields ([Section
6.5](#trailer.fields){.xref}) to communicate information collected while
sending the content.[¶](#section-3.4-2){.pilcrow}

A server responds to a client\'s request by sending one or more
\"response\" messages, each including a status code ([Section
15](#status.codes){.xref}). The response might also contain header
fields for server information, resource metadata, and representation
metadata, content to be interpreted in accordance with the status code,
and trailer fields to communicate information collected while sending
the content.[¶](#section-3.4-3){.pilcrow}

[]{#iref-spider-28 .iref}

The term \"user agent\" refers to any of the various client programs
that initiate a request.[¶](#section-3.5-1){.pilcrow}

The most familiar form of user agent is the general-purpose Web browser,
but that\'s only a small percentage of implementations. Other common
user agents include spiders (web-traversing robots), command-line tools,
billboard screens, household appliances, scales, light bulbs, firmware
update scripts, mobile apps, and communication devices in a multitude of
shapes and sizes.[¶](#section-3.5-2){.pilcrow}

Being a user agent does not imply that there is a human user directly
interacting with the software agent at the time of a request. In many
cases, a user agent is installed or configured to run in the background
and save its results for later inspection (or save only a subset of
those results that might be interesting or erroneous). Spiders, for
example, are typically given a start URI and configured to follow
certain behavior while crawling the Web as a hypertext
graph.[¶](#section-3.5-3){.pilcrow}

Many user agents cannot, or choose not to, make interactive suggestions
to their user or provide adequate warning for security or privacy
concerns. In the few cases where this specification requires reporting
of errors to the user, it is acceptable for such reporting to only be
observable in an error console or log file. Likewise, requirements that
an automated action be confirmed by the user before proceeding might be
met via advance configuration choices, run-time options, or simple
avoidance of the unsafe action; confirmation does not imply any specific
user interface or interruption of normal processing if the user has
already made that choice.[¶](#section-3.5-4){.pilcrow}

The figure above shows three intermediaries (A, B, and C) between the
user agent and origin server. A request or response message that travels
the whole chain will pass through four separate connections. Some HTTP
communication options might apply only to the connection with the
nearest, non-tunnel neighbor, only to the endpoints of the chain, or to
all connections along the chain. Although the diagram is linear, each
participant might be engaged in multiple, simultaneous communications.
For example, B might be receiving requests from many clients other than
A, and/or forwarding requests to servers other than C, at the same time
that it is handling A\'s request. Likewise, later requests might be sent

[]{#iref-proxy-35 .iref} A \"proxy\" is a message-forwarding agent that
is chosen by the client, usually via local configuration rules, to
receive requests for some type(s) of absolute URI and attempt to satisfy
those requests via translation through the HTTP interface. Some
translations are minimal, such as for proxy requests for \"http\" URIs,
whereas other requests might require translation to and from entirely
different application-level protocols. Proxies are often used to group
an organization\'s HTTP requests through a common intermediary for the
sake of security services, annotation services, or shared caching. Some
proxies are designed to apply transformations to selected messages or
content while they are being forwarded, as described in [Section
7.7](#message.transformations){.xref}.[¶](#section-3.7-5){.pilcrow}

[]{#iref-gateway-36 .iref} []{#iref-reverse-proxy-37 .iref}
[]{#iref-accelerator-38 .iref} A \"gateway\" (a.k.a. \"reverse proxy\")
is an intermediary that acts as an origin server for the outbound
connection but translates received requests and forwards them inbound to
another server or servers. Gateways are often used to encapsulate legacy
or untrusted information services, to improve server performance through
\"accelerator\" caching, and to enable partitioning or load balancing of
HTTP services across multiple machines.[¶](#section-3.7-6){.pilcrow}

All HTTP requirements applicable to an origin server also apply to the
outbound communication of a gateway. A gateway communicates with inbound
servers using any protocol that it desires, including private extensions
to HTTP that are outside the scope of this specification. However, an
HTTP-to-HTTP gateway that wishes to interoperate with third-party HTTP
servers needs to conform to user agent requirements on the gateway\'s
inbound connection.[¶](#section-3.7-7){.pilcrow}

[]{#iref-tunnel-39 .iref} A \"tunnel\" acts as a blind relay between two
connections without changing the messages. Once active, a tunnel is not
considered a party to the HTTP communication, though the tunnel might
have been initiated by an HTTP request. A tunnel ceases to exist when
both ends of the relayed connection are closed. Tunnels are used to
extend a virtual connection through an intermediary, such as when
Transport Layer Security (TLS, \[[TLS13](#TLS13){.xref}\]) is used to
establish confidential communication through a shared firewall
proxy.[¶](#section-3.7-8){.pilcrow}

The above categories for intermediary only consider those acting as
participants in the HTTP communication. There are also intermediaries
that can act on lower layers of the network protocol stack, filtering or
redirecting HTTP traffic without the knowledge or permission of message
senders. Network intermediaries are indistinguishable (at a protocol
level) from an on-path attacker, often introducing security flaws or
interoperability problems due to mistakenly violating HTTP
semantics.[¶](#section-3.7-9){.pilcrow}

[]{#iref-interception-proxy-40 .iref} []{#iref-transparent-proxy-41
.iref} For example, an \"interception proxy\"
\[[RFC3040](#RFC3040){.xref}\] (also commonly known as a \"transparent
proxy\" \[[RFC1919](#RFC1919){.xref}\]) differs from an HTTP proxy
because it is not chosen by the client. Instead, an interception proxy
filters or redirects outgoing TCP port 80 packets (and occasionally
other common port traffic). Interception proxies are commonly found on
public network access points, as a means of enforcing account
subscription prior to allowing use of non-local Internet services, and
within corporate firewalls to enforce network usage
policies.[¶](#section-3.7-10){.pilcrow}

A \"cache\" is a local store of previous response messages and the
subsystem that controls its message storage, retrieval, and deletion. A
cache stores cacheable responses in order to reduce the response time
and network bandwidth consumption on future, equivalent requests. Any
client or server [MAY]{.bcp14} employ a cache, though a cache cannot be
used while acting as a tunnel.[¶](#section-3.8-1){.pilcrow}

The effect of a cache is that the request/response chain is shortened if
one of the participants along the chain has a cached response applicable
to that request. The following illustrates the resulting chain if B has
a cached copy of an earlier response from O (via C) for a request that
has not been cached by UA or A.[¶](#section-3.8-2){.pilcrow}

[]{#iref-cacheable-43 .iref} A response is \"cacheable\" if a cache is
allowed to store a copy of the response message for use in answering
subsequent requests. Even when a response is cacheable, there might be
additional constraints placed by the client or by the origin server on
when that cached response can be used for a particular request. HTTP
requirements for cache behavior and cacheable responses are defined in
\[[CACHING](#CACHING){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3.8-4){.pilcrow}

There is a wide variety of architectures and configurations of caches
deployed across the World Wide Web and inside large organizations. These
include national hierarchies of proxy caches to save bandwidth and
reduce latency, content delivery networks that use gateway caching to
optimize regional and global distribution of popular sites,
collaborative systems that broadcast or multicast cache entries,
archives of pre-fetched cache entries for use in off-line or

scheme ([Section 4.2.1](#http.uri){.xref}) is specific to associating
authority with whomever controls the origin server listening for TCP
connections on the indicated port of whatever host is identified within
the authority component. This is a very weak sense of authority because
it depends on both client-specific name resolution mechanisms and
communication that might not be secured from an on-path attacker.
Nevertheless, it is a sufficient minimum for binding \"http\"
identifiers to an origin server for consistent resolution within a
trusted environment.[¶](#section-4.3.2-1){.pilcrow}

If the host identifier is provided as an IP address, the origin server
is the listener (if any) on the indicated TCP port at that IP address.
If host is a registered name, the registered name is an indirect
identifier for use with a name resolution service, such as DNS, to find
an address for an appropriate origin
server.[¶](#section-4.3.2-2){.pilcrow}

When an \"http\" URI is used within a context that calls for access to
the indicated resource, a client [MAY]{.bcp14} attempt access by
resolving the host identifier to an IP address, establishing a TCP
connection to that address on the indicated port, and sending over that
connection an HTTP request message containing a request target that
matches the client\'s target URI ([Section
7.1](#target.resource){.xref}).[¶](#section-4.3.2-3){.pilcrow}

If the server responds to such a request with a non-interim HTTP
response message, as described in [Section 15](#status.codes){.xref},
then that response is considered an authoritative answer to the
client\'s request.[¶](#section-4.3.2-4){.pilcrow}

Note, however, that the above is not the only means for obtaining an
authoritative response, nor does it imply that an authoritative response
is always necessary (see \[[CACHING](#CACHING){.xref}\]). For example,
the Alt-Svc header field \[[ALTSVC](#ALTSVC){.xref}\] allows an origin
server to identify other services that are also authoritative for that
origin. Access to \"http\" identified resources might also be provided
by protocols outside the scope of this
document.[¶](#section-4.3.2-5){.pilcrow}

#### [4.3.3.](#section-4.3.3){.section-number .selfRef} [https Origins](#name-https-origins){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-https-origins}

The \"https\" scheme ([Section 4.2.2](#https.uri){.xref}) associates
authority based on the ability of a server to use the private key
corresponding to a certificate that the client considers to be
trustworthy for the identified origin server. The client usually relies
upon a chain of trust, conveyed from some prearranged or configured
trust anchor, to deem a certificate trustworthy ([Section
4.3.4](#https.verify){.xref}).[¶](#section-4.3.3-1){.pilcrow}

In HTTP/1.1 and earlier, a client will only attribute authority to a
server when they are communicating over a successfully established and
secured connection specifically to that URI origin\'s host. The
connection establishment and certificate verification are used as proof
of authority.[¶](#section-4.3.3-2){.pilcrow}

In HTTP/2 and HTTP/3, a client will attribute authority to a server when
they are communicating over a successfully established and secured
connection if the URI origin\'s host matches any of the hosts present in
the server\'s certificate and the client believes that it could open a
connection to that host for that URI. In practice, a client will make a
DNS query to check that the origin\'s host contains the same server IP
address as the established connection. This restriction can be removed
by the origin server sending an equivalent ORIGIN frame
\[[RFC8336](#RFC8336){.xref}\].[¶](#section-4.3.3-3){.pilcrow}

The request target\'s host and port value are passed within each HTTP
request, identifying the origin and distinguishing it from other
namespaces that might be controlled by the same server ([Section
7.2](#field.host){.xref}). It is the origin\'s responsibility to ensure
that any services provided with control over its certificate\'s private
key are equally responsible for managing the corresponding \"https\"
namespaces or at least prepared to reject requests that appear to have
been misdirected ([Section
7.4](#routing.reject){.xref}).[¶](#section-4.3.3-4){.pilcrow}

An origin server might be unwilling to process requests for certain
target URIs even when they have the authority to do so. For example,
when a host operates distinct services on different ports (e.g., 443 and
8000), checking the target URI at the origin server is necessary (even
after the connection has been secured) because a network attacker might
cause connections for one port to be received at some other port.
Failing to check the target URI might allow such an attacker to replace
a response to one target URI (e.g., \"https://example.com/foo\") with a
seemingly authoritative response from the other port (e.g.,
\"https://example.com:8000/foo\").[¶](#section-4.3.3-5){.pilcrow}

Note that the \"https\" scheme does not rely on TCP and the connected
port number for associating authority, since both are outside the
secured communication and thus cannot be trusted as definitive. Hence,
the HTTP communication might take place over any channel that has been
secured, as defined in [Section 4.2.2](#https.uri){.xref}, including
protocols that don\'t use TCP.[¶](#section-4.3.3-6){.pilcrow}

When an \"https\" URI is used within a context that calls for access to
the indicated resource, a client [MAY]{.bcp14} attempt access by
resolving the host identifier to an IP address, establishing a TCP
connection to that address on the indicated port, securing the
connection end-to-end by successfully initiating TLS over TCP with
confidentiality and integrity protection, and sending over that
connection an HTTP request message containing a request target that
matches the client\'s target URI ([Section
7.1](#target.resource){.xref}).[¶](#section-4.3.3-7){.pilcrow}

If the server responds to such a request with a non-interim HTTP
response message, as described in [Section 15](#status.codes){.xref},
then that response is considered an authoritative answer to the
client\'s request.[¶](#section-4.3.3-8){.pilcrow}

Note, however, that the above is not the only means for obtaining an
authoritative response, nor does it imply that an authoritative response
is always necessary (see

#### [4.3.4.](#section-4.3.4){.section-number .selfRef} [https Certificate Verification](#name-https-certificate-verificat){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-https-certificate-verificat}

To establish a [secured](#https.uri){.xref} connection to dereference a
URI, a client [MUST]{.bcp14} verify that the service\'s identity is an
acceptable match for the URI\'s origin server. Certificate verification
is used to prevent server impersonation by an on-path attacker or by an
attacker that controls name resolution. This process requires that a
client be configured with a set of trust
anchors.[¶](#section-4.3.4-1){.pilcrow}

In general, a client [MUST]{.bcp14} verify the service identity using
the verification process defined in [Section
6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6125#section-6){.relref} of
\[[RFC6125](#RFC6125){.xref}\]. The client [MUST]{.bcp14} construct a
reference identity from the service\'s host: if the host is a literal IP
address ([Section 4.3.5](#https.ip-id){.xref}), the reference identity
is an IP-ID, otherwise the host is a name and the reference identity is
a DNS-ID.[¶](#section-4.3.4-2){.pilcrow}

A reference identity of type CN-ID [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be used by
clients. As noted in [Section
6.2.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6125#section-6.2.1){.relref} of
\[[RFC6125](#RFC6125){.xref}\], a reference identity of type CN-ID might
be used by older clients.[¶](#section-4.3.4-3){.pilcrow}

A client might be specially configured to accept an alternative form of
server identity verification. For example, a client might be connecting
to a server whose address and hostname are dynamic, with an expectation
that the service will present a specific certificate (or a certificate
matching some externally defined reference identity) rather than one
matching the target URI\'s origin.[¶](#section-4.3.4-4){.pilcrow}

In special cases, it might be appropriate for a client to simply ignore
the server\'s identity, but it must be understood that this leaves a
connection open to active attack.[¶](#section-4.3.4-5){.pilcrow}

If the certificate is not valid for the target URI\'s origin, a user
agent [MUST]{.bcp14} either obtain confirmation from the user before
proceeding (see [Section 3.5](#user.agent){.xref}) or terminate the
connection with a bad certificate error. Automated clients
[MUST]{.bcp14} log the error to an appropriate audit log (if available)
and [SHOULD]{.bcp14} terminate the connection (with a bad certificate
error). Automated clients [MAY]{.bcp14} provide a configuration setting
that disables this check, but [MUST]{.bcp14} provide a setting which
enables it.[¶](#section-4.3.4-6){.pilcrow}

A server that is identified using an IP address literal in the \"host\"
field of an \"https\" URI has a reference identity of type IP-ID. An IP
version 4 address uses the \"IPv4address\" ABNF rule, and an IP version
6 address uses the \"IP-literal\" production with the \"IPv6address\"
option; see [Section
3.2.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986#section-3.2.2){.relref} of
\[[URI](#URI){.xref}\]. A reference identity of IP-ID contains the
decoded bytes of the IP address.[¶](#section-4.3.5-1){.pilcrow}

An IP version 4 address is 4 octets, and an IP version 6 address is 16
octets. Use of IP-ID is not defined for any other IP version. The
iPAddress choice in the certificate subjectAltName extension does not
explicitly include the IP version and so relies on the length of the
address to distinguish versions; see [Section
4.2.1.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5280#section-4.2.1.6){.relref}
of \[[RFC5280](#RFC5280){.xref}\].[¶](#section-4.3.5-2){.pilcrow}

HTTP uses \"fields\" to provide data in the form of extensible

A field name labels the corresponding field value as having the
semantics defined by that name. For example, the
[Date](#field.date){.xref} header field is defined in [Section
6.6.1](#field.date){.xref} as containing the origination timestamp for
the message in which it appears.[¶](#section-5.1-1){.pilcrow}

Field names are case-insensitive and ought to be registered within the
\"Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Field Name Registry\"; see [Section
16.3.1](#fields.registry){.xref}.[¶](#section-5.1-3){.pilcrow}

The interpretation of a field does not change between minor versions of
the same major HTTP version, though the default behavior of a recipient
in the absence of such a field can change. Unless specified otherwise,
fields are defined for all versions of HTTP. In particular, the
[Host](#field.host){.xref} and [Connection](#field.connection){.xref}
fields ought to be recognized by all HTTP implementations whether or not
they advertise conformance with HTTP/1.1.[¶](#section-5.1-4){.pilcrow}

New fields can be introduced without changing the protocol version if
their defined semantics allow them to be safely ignored by recipients
that do not recognize them; see [Section
16.3](#fields.extensibility){.xref}.[¶](#section-5.1-5){.pilcrow}

A proxy [MUST]{.bcp14} forward unrecognized header fields unless the
field name is listed in the [Connection](#field.connection){.xref}
header field ([Section 7.6.1](#field.connection){.xref}) or the proxy is
specifically configured to block, or otherwise transform, such fields.
Other recipients [SHOULD]{.bcp14} ignore unrecognized header and trailer
fields. Adhering to these requirements allows HTTP\'s functionality to

[]{#iref-field-line-68 .iref} []{#iref-field-name-69 .iref}
[]{#iref-field-line-value-70 .iref} Field sections are composed of any
number of \"field lines\", each with a \"field name\" (see [Section

field.[¶](#section-5.2-1){.pilcrow}

[]{#iref-field-value-71 .iref} When a field name is only present once in
a section, the combined \"field value\" for that field consists of the
corresponding field line value. When a field name is repeated within a
section, its combined field value consists of the list of corresponding
field line values within that section, concatenated in order, with each
field line value separated by a comma.[¶](#section-5.2-2){.pilcrow}

For example, this section:[¶](#section-5.2-3){.pilcrow}

A recipient [MAY]{.bcp14} combine multiple field lines within a field
section that have the same field name into one field line, without
changing the semantics of the message, by appending each subsequent
field line value to the initial field line value in order, separated by
a comma (\",\") and optional whitespace ([OWS](#whitespace){.xref},
defined in [Section 5.6.3](#whitespace){.xref}). For consistency, use
comma SP.[¶](#section-5.3-1){.pilcrow}

The order in which field lines with the same name are received is
therefore significant to the interpretation of the field value; a proxy
[MUST NOT]{.bcp14} change the order of these field line values when
forwarding a message.[¶](#section-5.3-2){.pilcrow}

This means that, aside from the well-known exception noted below, a
sender [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} generate multiple field lines with the same
name in a message (whether in the headers or trailers) or append a field
line when a field line of the same name already exists in the message,
unless that field\'s definition allows multiple field line values to be
recombined as a comma-separated list (i.e., at least one alternative of
the field\'s definition allows a comma-separated list, such as an ABNF
rule of #(values) defined in [Section
5.6.1](#abnf.extension){.xref}).[¶](#section-5.3-3){.pilcrow}

**Note:** In practice, the \"Set-Cookie\" header field
(\[[COOKIE](#COOKIE){.xref}\]) often appears in a response message
across multiple field lines and does not use the list syntax, violating
the above requirements on multiple field lines with the same field name.
Since it cannot be combined into a single field value, recipients ought
to handle \"Set-Cookie\" as a special case while processing fields. (See
Appendix A.2.3 of \[[Kri2001](#Kri2001){.xref}\] for
details.)[¶](#section-5.3-4.1){.pilcrow}

The order in which field lines with differing field names are received
in a section is not significant. However, it is good practice to send
header fields that contain additional control data first, such as
[Host](#field.host){.xref} on requests and [Date](#field.date){.xref} on
responses, so that implementations can decide when not to handle a
message as early as possible.[¶](#section-5.3-5){.pilcrow}

A server [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} apply a request to the target resource until
it receives the entire request header section, since later header field
lines might include conditionals, authentication credentials, or
deliberately misleading duplicate header fields that could impact
request processing.[¶](#section-5.3-6){.pilcrow}

HTTP does not place a predefined limit on the length of each field line,
field value, or on the length of a header or trailer section as a whole,
as described in [Section 2](#conformance){.xref}. Various ad hoc
limitations on individual lengths are found in practice, often depending
on the specific field\'s semantics.[¶](#section-5.4-1){.pilcrow}

A server that receives a request header field line, field value, or set
of fields larger than it wishes to process [MUST]{.bcp14} respond with
an appropriate [4xx (Client Error)](#status.4xx){.xref} status code.
Ignoring such header fields would increase the server\'s vulnerability
to request smuggling attacks ([Section

\[[HTTP/1.1](#HTTP11){.xref}\]).[¶](#section-5.4-2){.pilcrow}

A field value does not include leading or trailing whitespace. When a
specific version of HTTP allows such whitespace to appear in a message,
a field parsing implementation [MUST]{.bcp14} exclude such whitespace
prior to evaluating the field value.[¶](#section-5.5-3){.pilcrow}

Field values are usually constrained to the range of US-ASCII characters
\[[USASCII](#USASCII){.xref}\]. Fields needing a greater range of
characters can use an encoding, such as the one defined in
\[[RFC8187](#RFC8187){.xref}\]. Historically, HTTP allowed field content
with text in the ISO-8859-1 charset
\[[ISO-8859-1](#ISO-8859-1){.xref}\], supporting other charsets only
through use of \[[RFC2047](#RFC2047){.xref}\] encoding. Specifications
for newly defined fields [SHOULD]{.bcp14} limit their values to visible
US-ASCII octets (VCHAR), SP, and HTAB. A recipient [SHOULD]{.bcp14}
treat other allowed octets in field content (i.e.,
[obs-text](#fields.values){.xref}) as opaque
data.[¶](#section-5.5-4){.pilcrow}

Field values containing CR, LF, or NUL characters are invalid and
dangerous, due to the varying ways that implementations might parse and
interpret those characters; a recipient of CR, LF, or NUL within a field
value [MUST]{.bcp14} either reject the message or replace each of those
characters with SP before further processing or forwarding of that
message. Field values containing other CTL characters are also invalid;
however, recipients [MAY]{.bcp14} retain such characters for the sake of
robustness when they appear within a safe context (e.g., an
application-specific quoted string that will not be processed by any
downstream HTTP parser).[¶](#section-5.5-5){.pilcrow}

[]{#iref-singleton-field-76 .iref} Fields that only anticipate a single
member as the field value are referred to as \"singleton
fields\".[¶](#section-5.5-6){.pilcrow}

[]{#iref-list-based-field-77 .iref} Fields that allow multiple members
as the field value are referred to as \"list-based fields\". The list
operator extension of [Section 5.6.1](#abnf.extension){.xref} is used as
a common notation for defining field values that can contain multiple
members.[¶](#section-5.5-7){.pilcrow}

Because commas (\",\") are used as the delimiter between members, they
need to be treated with care if they are allowed as data within a
member. This is true for both list-based and singleton fields, since a
singleton field might be erroneously sent with multiple members and
detecting such errors improves interoperability. Fields that expect to
contain a comma within a member, such as within an
[HTTP-date](#http.date){.xref} or
[URI-reference](#uri.references){.xref} element, ought to be defined
with delimiters around that element to distinguish any comma within that
data from potential list separators.[¶](#section-5.5-8){.pilcrow}

For example, a textual date and a URI (either of which might contain a
comma) could be safely carried in list-based field values like
these:[¶](#section-5.5-9){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-5.5-10}
``` {.lang-http-message .sourcecode}
Example-URIs: "http://example.com/a.html,foo",

:::

Note that double-quote delimiters are almost always used with the
quoted-string production ([Section 5.6.4](#quoted.strings){.xref});
using a different syntax inside double-quotes will likely cause
unnecessary confusion.[¶](#section-5.5-11){.pilcrow}

Many fields (such as [Content-Type](#field.content-type){.xref}, defined
in [Section 8.3](#field.content-type){.xref}) use a common syntax for
parameters that allows both unquoted (token) and quoted (quoted-string)
syntax for a parameter value ([Section 5.6.6](#parameter){.xref}). Use
of common syntax allows recipients to reuse existing parser components.
When allowing both forms, the meaning of a parameter value ought to be
the same whether it was received as a token or a quoted
string.[¶](#section-5.5-12){.pilcrow}

**Note:** For defining field value syntax, this specification uses an
ABNF rule named after the field name to define the allowed grammar for

list elements: enough to handle common mistakes by senders that merge
values, but not so much that they could be used as a denial-of-service
mechanism. In other words, a recipient [MUST]{.bcp14} accept lists that
satisfy the following syntax:[¶](#section-5.6.1.2-1){.pilcrow}

RFC 5234 ABNF cannot enforce the cardinality of list elements, and
consequently all cases are mapped as if there was no cardinality
specified.[¶](#section-5.6.1.2-3){.pilcrow}

[]{#iref-self-descriptive-112 .iref}

Each major version of HTTP defines its own syntax for communicating
messages. This section defines an abstract data type for HTTP messages
based on a generalization of those message characteristics, common
structure, and capacity for conveying semantics. This abstraction is
used to define requirements on senders and recipients that are
independent of the HTTP version, such that a message in one version can
be relayed through other versions without changing its
meaning.[¶](#section-6-1){.pilcrow}

A \"message\" consists of the following:[¶](#section-6-2){.pilcrow}

-   [control data to describe and route the
    message,[¶](#section-6-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-6-3.1}
-   [a headers lookup table of name/value pairs for extending that
    control data and conveying additional information about the sender,
    message, content, or
    context,[¶](#section-6-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-6-3.2}
-   [a potentially unbounded stream of content,
    and[¶](#section-6-3.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-6-3.3}
-   [a trailers lookup table of name/value pairs for communicating
    information obtained while sending the
    content.[¶](#section-6-3.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-6-3.4}

Framing and control data is sent first, followed by a header section
containing fields for the headers table. When a message includes
content, the content is sent after the header section, potentially
followed by a trailer section that might contain fields for the trailers
table.[¶](#section-6-4){.pilcrow}

Messages are expected to be processed as a stream, wherein the purpose
of that stream and its continued processing is revealed while being
read. Hence, control data describes what the recipient needs to know
immediately, header fields describe what needs to be known before
receiving content, the content (when present) presumably contains what
the recipient wants or needs to fulfill the message semantics, and
trailer fields provide optional metadata that was unknown prior to
sending the content.[¶](#section-6-5){.pilcrow}

Messages are intended to be \"self-descriptive\": everything a recipient
needs to know about the message can be determined by looking at the
message itself, after decoding or reconstituting parts that have been
compressed or elided in transit, without requiring an understanding of
the sender\'s current application state (established via prior
messages). However, a client [MUST]{.bcp14} retain knowledge of the
request when parsing, interpreting, or caching a corresponding response.
For example, responses to the [HEAD](#HEAD){.xref} method look just like
the beginning of a response to [GET](#GET){.xref} but cannot be parsed
in the same manner.[¶](#section-6-6){.pilcrow}

Note that this message abstraction is a generalization across many
versions of HTTP, including features that might not be found in some
versions. For example, trailers were introduced within the HTTP/1.1
chunked transfer coding as a trailer section after the content. An
equivalent feature is present in HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 within the header
block that terminates each stream.[¶](#section-6-7){.pilcrow}

[]{#iref-complete-113 .iref} []{#iref-incomplete-114 .iref}

Message framing indicates how each message begins and ends, such that
each message can be distinguished from other messages or noise on the
same connection. Each major version of HTTP defines its own framing
mechanism.[¶](#section-6.1-1){.pilcrow}

HTTP/0.9 and early deployments of HTTP/1.0 used closure of the
underlying connection to end a response. For backwards compatibility,
this implicit framing is also allowed in HTTP/1.1. However, implicit
framing can fail to distinguish an incomplete response if the connection
closes early. For that reason, almost all modern implementations use
explicit framing in the form of length-delimited sequences of message
data.[¶](#section-6.1-2){.pilcrow}

A message is considered \"complete\" when all of the octets indicated by
its framing are available. Note that, when no explicit framing is used,
a response message that is ended by the underlying connection\'s close
is considered complete even though it might be indistinguishable from an
incomplete response, unless a transport-level error indicates that it is
not complete.[¶](#section-6.1-3){.pilcrow}

[]{#iref-control-data-115 .iref}

Messages start with control data that describe its primary purpose.
Request message control data includes a request method ([Section
9](#methods){.xref}), request target ([Section
7.1](#target.resource){.xref}), and protocol version ([Section
2.5](#protocol.version){.xref}). Response message control data includes
a status code ([Section 15](#status.codes){.xref}), optional reason
phrase, and protocol version.[¶](#section-6.2-1){.pilcrow}

In HTTP/1.1 (\[[HTTP/1.1](#HTTP11){.xref}\]) and earlier, control data
is sent as the first line of a message. In HTTP/2
(\[[HTTP/2](#HTTP2){.xref}\]) and HTTP/3 (\[[HTTP/3](#HTTP3){.xref}\]),
control data is sent as pseudo-header fields with a reserved name prefix
(e.g., \":authority\").[¶](#section-6.2-2){.pilcrow}

Every HTTP message has a protocol version. Depending on the version in
use, it might be identified within the message explicitly or inferred by
the connection over which the message is received. Recipients use that
version information to determine limitations or potential for later
communication with that sender.[¶](#section-6.2-3){.pilcrow}

When a message is forwarded by an intermediary, the protocol version is
updated to reflect the version used by that intermediary. The
[Via](#field.via){.xref} header field ([Section
7.6.3](#field.via){.xref}) is used to communicate upstream protocol
information within a forwarded message.[¶](#section-6.2-4){.pilcrow}

A client [SHOULD]{.bcp14} send a request version equal to the highest
version to which the client is conformant and whose major version is no
higher than the highest version supported by the server, if this is
known. A client [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} send a version to which it is not
conformant.[¶](#section-6.2-5){.pilcrow}

A client [MAY]{.bcp14} send a lower request version if it is known that
the server incorrectly implements the HTTP specification, but only after
the client has attempted at least one normal request and determined from
the response status code or header fields (e.g.,
[Server](#field.server){.xref}) that the server improperly handles
higher request versions.[¶](#section-6.2-6){.pilcrow}

A server [SHOULD]{.bcp14} send a response version equal to the highest
version to which the server is conformant that has a major version less
than or equal to the one received in the request. A server [MUST
NOT]{.bcp14} send a version to which it is not conformant. A server can
send a [505 (HTTP Version Not Supported)](#status.505){.xref} response
if it wishes, for any reason, to refuse service of the client\'s major
protocol version.[¶](#section-6.2-7){.pilcrow}

A recipient that receives a message with a major version number that it
implements and a minor version number higher than what it implements
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} process the message as if it were in the highest minor

colloquially).[¶](#section-6.3-1){.pilcrow}

The \"header section\" of a message consists of a sequence of header
field lines. Each header field might modify or extend message semantics,
describe the sender, define the content, or provide additional
context.[¶](#section-6.3-2){.pilcrow}

HTTP messages often transfer a complete or partial representation as the
message \"content\": a stream of octets sent after the header section,
as delineated by the message framing.[¶](#section-6.4-1){.pilcrow}

This abstract definition of content reflects the data after it has been
extracted from the message framing. For example, an HTTP/1.1 message
body ([Section
6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9112#section-6){.relref} of
\[[HTTP/1.1](#HTTP11){.xref}\]) might consist of a stream of data
encoded with the chunked transfer coding \-- a sequence of data chunks,
one zero-length chunk, and a trailer section \-- whereas the content of
that same message includes only the data stream after the transfer
coding has been decoded; it does not include the chunk lengths, chunked
framing syntax, nor the trailer fields ([Section
6.5](#trailer.fields){.xref}).[¶](#section-6.4-2){.pilcrow}

**Note:** Some field names have a \"Content-\" prefix. This is an
informal convention; while some of these fields refer to the content of
the message, as defined above, others are scoped to the selected
representation ([Section 3.2](#representations){.xref}). See the
individual field\'s definition to

The purpose of content in a request is defined by the method semantics
([Section 9](#methods){.xref}).[¶](#section-6.4.1-1){.pilcrow}

For example, a representation in the content of a PUT request ([Section
9.3.4](#PUT){.xref}) represents the desired state of the [target
resource](#target.resource){.xref} after the request is successfully
applied, whereas a representation in the content of a POST request
([Section 9.3.3](#POST){.xref}) represents information to be processed
by the target resource.[¶](#section-6.4.1-2){.pilcrow}

In a response, the content\'s purpose is defined by the request method,
response status code ([Section 15](#status.codes){.xref}), and response
fields describing that content. For example, the content of a [200
(OK)](#status.200){.xref} response to GET ([Section 9.3.1](#GET){.xref})
represents the current state of the [target
resource](#target.resource){.xref}, as observed at the time of the
message origination date ([Section 6.6.1](#field.date){.xref}), whereas
the content of the same status code in a response to POST might
represent either the processing result or the new state of the target
resource after applying the processing.[¶](#section-6.4.1-3){.pilcrow}

The content of a [206 (Partial Content)](#status.206){.xref} response to
GET contains either a single part of the selected representation or a
multipart message body containing multiple parts of that representation,
as described in [Section
15.3.7](#status.206){.xref}.[¶](#section-6.4.1-4){.pilcrow}

Response messages with an error status code usually contain content that
represents the error condition, such that the content describes the
error state and what steps are suggested for resolving
it.[¶](#section-6.4.1-5){.pilcrow}

Responses to the HEAD request method ([Section 9.3.2](#HEAD){.xref})
never include content; the associated response header fields indicate
only what their values would have been if the request method had been
GET ([Section 9.3.1](#GET){.xref}).[¶](#section-6.4.1-6){.pilcrow}

[2xx (Successful)](#status.2xx){.xref} responses to a CONNECT request
method ([Section 9.3.6](#CONNECT){.xref}) switch the connection to
tunnel mode instead of having content.[¶](#section-6.4.1-7){.pilcrow}

When a complete or partial representation is transferred as message
content, it is often desirable for the sender to supply, or the
recipient to determine, an identifier for a resource corresponding to
that specific representation. For example, a client making a GET request
on a resource for \"the current weather report\" might want an
identifier specific to the content returned (e.g., \"weather report for
Laguna Beach at 20210720T1711\"). This can be useful for sharing or
bookmarking content from resources that are expected to have changing
representations over time.[¶](#section-6.4.2-1){.pilcrow}

For a request message:[¶](#section-6.4.2-2){.pilcrow}

-   [If the request has a

Fields ([Section 5](#fields){.xref}) that are located within a \"trailer

colloquially). Trailer fields can be useful for supplying message
integrity checks, digital signatures, delivery metrics, or
post-processing status information.[¶](#section-6.5-1){.pilcrow}

Trailer fields ought to be processed and stored separately from the
fields in the header section to avoid contradicting message semantics
known at the time the header section was complete. The presence or
absence of certain header fields might impact choices made for the
routing or processing of the message as a whole before the trailers are
received; those choices cannot be unmade by the later discovery of
trailer fields.[¶](#section-6.5-2){.pilcrow}

A trailer section is only possible when supported by the version of HTTP
in use and enabled by an explicit framing mechanism. For example, the
chunked transfer coding in HTTP/1.1 allows a trailer section to be sent
after the content ([Section
7.1.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9112#section-7.1.2){.relref} of
\[[HTTP/1.1](#HTTP11){.xref}\]).[¶](#section-6.5.1-1){.pilcrow}

Many fields cannot be processed outside the header section because their
evaluation is necessary prior to receiving the content, such as those
that describe message framing, routing, authentication, request
modifiers, response controls, or content format. A sender [MUST
NOT]{.bcp14} generate a trailer field unless the sender knows the
corresponding header field name\'s definition permits the field to be
sent in trailers.[¶](#section-6.5.1-2){.pilcrow}

Trailer fields can be difficult to process by intermediaries that
forward messages from one protocol version to another. If the entire
message can be buffered in transit, some intermediaries could merge
trailer fields into the header section (as appropriate) before it is
forwarded. However, in most cases, the trailers are simply discarded. A
recipient [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} merge a trailer field into a header section
unless the recipient understands the corresponding header field
definition and that definition explicitly permits and defines how
trailer field values can be safely
merged.[¶](#section-6.5.1-3){.pilcrow}

The presence of the keyword \"trailers\" in the TE header field
([Section 10.1.4](#field.te){.xref}) of a request indicates that the
client is willing to accept trailer fields, on behalf of itself and any
downstream clients. For requests from an intermediary, this implies that
all downstream clients are willing to accept trailer fields in the
forwarded response. Note that the presence of \"trailers\" does not mean
that the client(s) will process any particular trailer field in the
response; only that the trailer section(s) will not be dropped by any of
the clients.[¶](#section-6.5.1-4){.pilcrow}

Because of the potential for trailer fields to be discarded in transit,
a server [SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} generate trailer fields that it believes
are necessary for the user agent to
receive.[¶](#section-6.5.1-5){.pilcrow}

The \"Trailer\" header field ([Section 6.6.2](#field.trailer){.xref})
can be sent to indicate fields likely to be sent in the trailer section,
which allows recipients to prepare for their receipt before processing
the content. For example, this could be useful if a field name indicates
that a dynamic checksum should be calculated as the content is received
and then immediately checked upon receipt of the trailer field
value.[¶](#section-6.5.2-1){.pilcrow}

Like header fields, trailer fields with the same name are processed in
the order received; multiple trailer field lines with the same name have
the equivalent semantics as appending the multiple values as a list of
members. Trailer fields that might be generated more than once during a
message [MUST]{.bcp14} be defined as a list-based field even if each
member value is only processed once per field line
received.[¶](#section-6.5.2-2){.pilcrow}

received trailer fields as a data structure of name/value pairs, similar
to (but separate from) the header fields. Additional processing

Although HTTP is used in a wide variety of applications, most clients
rely on the same resource identification mechanism and configuration
techniques as general-purpose Web browsers. Even when communication
options are hard-coded in a client\'s configuration, we can think of
their combined effect as a URI reference ([Section
4.1](#uri.references){.xref}).[¶](#section-7.1-1){.pilcrow}

A URI reference is resolved to its absolute form in order to obtain the
\"target URI\". The target URI excludes the reference\'s fragment
component, if any, since fragment identifiers are reserved for
client-side processing (\[[URI](#URI){.xref}\], [Section
3.5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986#section-3.5){.relref}).[¶](#section-7.1-2){.pilcrow}

To perform an action on a \"target resource\", the client sends a
request message containing enough components of its parsed target URI to
enable recipients to identify that same resource. For historical
reasons, the parsed target URI components, collectively referred to as
the \"request target\", are sent within the message control data and the
[Host](#field.host){.xref} header field ([Section
7.2](#field.host){.xref}).[¶](#section-7.1-3){.pilcrow}

There are two unusual cases for which the request target components are
in a method-specific form:[¶](#section-7.1-4){.pilcrow}

-   [For CONNECT ([Section 9.3.6](#CONNECT){.xref}), the request target
    is the host name and port number of the tunnel destination,
    separated by a
    colon.[¶](#section-7.1-5.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-7.1-5.1}
-   [For OPTIONS ([Section 9.3.7](#OPTIONS){.xref}), the request target
    can be a single asterisk
    (\"\*\").[¶](#section-7.1-5.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-7.1-5.2}

See the respective method definitions for details. These forms [MUST
NOT]{.bcp14} be used with other methods.[¶](#section-7.1-6){.pilcrow}

Upon receipt of a client\'s request, a server reconstructs the target
URI from the received components in accordance with their local
configuration and incoming connection context. This reconstruction is
specific to each major protocol version. For example, [Section
3.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9112#section-3.3){.relref} of
\[[HTTP/1.1](#HTTP11){.xref}\] defines how a server determines the

In HTTP/2 \[[HTTP/2](#HTTP2){.xref}\] and HTTP/3

satisfy the request. Proxy configuration is implementation-dependent,
but is often based on URI prefix matching, selective authority matching,
or both, and the proxy itself is usually identified by an \"http\" or
\"https\" URI.[¶](#section-7.3.2-1){.pilcrow}

If an \"http\" or \"https\" proxy is applicable, the client connects
inbound by establishing (or reusing) a connection to that proxy and then
sending it an HTTP request message containing a request target that
matches the client\'s target URI.[¶](#section-7.3.2-2){.pilcrow}

If no proxy is applicable, a typical client will invoke a handler
routine (specific to the target URI\'s scheme) to obtain access to the
identified resource. How that is accomplished is dependent on the target
URI scheme and defined by its associated
specification.[¶](#section-7.3.3-1){.pilcrow}

Once a request is received by a server and parsed sufficiently to
determine its target URI, the server decides whether to process the
request itself, forward the request to another server, redirect the
client to a different resource, respond with an error, or drop the
connection. This decision can be influenced by anything about the
request or connection context, but is specifically directed at whether
the server has been configured to process requests for that target URI
and whether the connection context is appropriate for that
request.[¶](#section-7.4-1){.pilcrow}

For example, a request might have been misdirected, deliberately or
accidentally, such that the information within a received
[Host](#field.host){.xref} header field differs from the connection\'s
host or port. If the connection is from a trusted gateway, such
inconsistency might be expected; otherwise, it might indicate an attempt
to bypass security filters, trick the server into delivering non-public
content, or poison a cache. See [Section
17](#security.considerations){.xref} for security considerations
regarding message routing.[¶](#section-7.4-2){.pilcrow}

Unless the connection is from a trusted gateway, an origin server
[MUST]{.bcp14} reject a request if any scheme-specific requirements for
the target URI are not met. In particular, a request for an \"https\"
resource [MUST]{.bcp14} be rejected unless it has been received over a
connection that has been secured via a certificate valid for that target
URI\'s origin, as defined by [Section
4.2.2](#https.uri){.xref}.[¶](#section-7.4-3){.pilcrow}

The [421 (Misdirected Request)](#status.421){.xref} status code in a
response indicates that the origin server has rejected the request
because it appears to have been misdirected ([Section
15.5.20](#status.421){.xref}).[¶](#section-7.4-4){.pilcrow}

A connection might be used for multiple request/response exchanges. The
mechanism used to correlate between request and response messages is
version dependent; some versions of HTTP use implicit ordering of
messages, while others use an explicit
identifier.[¶](#section-7.5-1){.pilcrow}

All responses, regardless of the status code (including
[interim](#final.interim){.xref} responses) can be sent at any time
after a request is received, even if the request is not yet complete. A
response can complete before its corresponding request is complete
([Section 6.1](#message.framing){.xref}). Likewise, clients are not
expected to wait any specific amount of time for a response. Clients
(including intermediaries) might abandon a request if the response is
not received within a reasonable period of
time.[¶](#section-7.5-2){.pilcrow}

A client that receives a response while it is still sending the
associated request [SHOULD]{.bcp14} continue sending that request unless
it receives an explicit indication to the contrary (see, e.g., [Section

As described in [Section 3.7](#intermediaries){.xref}, intermediaries
can serve a variety of roles in the processing of HTTP requests and
responses. Some intermediaries are used to improve performance or
availability. Others are used for access control or to filter content.
Since an HTTP stream has characteristics similar to a pipe-and-filter
architecture, there are no inherent limits to the extent an intermediary
can enhance (or interfere) with either direction of the
stream.[¶](#section-7.6-1){.pilcrow}

Intermediaries are expected to forward messages even when protocol
elements are not recognized (e.g., new methods, status codes, or field
names) since that preserves extensibility for downstream
recipients.[¶](#section-7.6-2){.pilcrow}

An intermediary not acting as a tunnel [MUST]{.bcp14} implement the
[Connection](#field.connection){.xref} header field, as specified in
[Section 7.6.1](#field.connection){.xref}, and exclude fields from being
forwarded that are only intended for the incoming
connection.[¶](#section-7.6-3){.pilcrow}

An intermediary [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} forward a message to itself unless it
is protected from an infinite request loop. In general, an intermediary
ought to recognize its own server names, including any aliases, local
variations, or literal IP addresses, and respond to such requests
directly.[¶](#section-7.6-4){.pilcrow}

An HTTP message can be parsed as a stream for incremental processing or
forwarding downstream. However, senders and recipients cannot rely on
incremental delivery of partial messages, since some implementations
will buffer or delay message forwarding for the sake of network
efficiency, security checks, or content
transformations.[¶](#section-7.6-5){.pilcrow}

[¶](#section-7.6.1-2){.pilcrow}
:::

Connection options are case-insensitive.[¶](#section-7.6.1-3){.pilcrow}

When a field aside from Connection is used to supply control information
for or about the current connection, the sender [MUST]{.bcp14} list the
corresponding field name within the Connection header field. Note that
some versions of HTTP prohibit the use of fields for such information,
and therefore do not allow the Connection
field.[¶](#section-7.6.1-4){.pilcrow}

Intermediaries [MUST]{.bcp14} parse a received Connection header field
before a message is forwarded and, for each connection-option in this
field, remove any header or trailer field(s) from the message with the
same name as the connection-option, and then remove the Connection
header field itself (or replace it with the intermediary\'s own control
options for the forwarded message).[¶](#section-7.6.1-5){.pilcrow}

Hence, the Connection header field provides a declarative way of
distinguishing fields that are only intended for the immediate recipient
(\"hop-by-hop\") from those fields that are intended for all recipients
on the chain (\"end-to-end\"), enabling the message to be
self-descriptive and allowing future connection-specific extensions to
be deployed without fear that they will be blindly forwarded by older
intermediaries.[¶](#section-7.6.1-6){.pilcrow}

Furthermore, intermediaries [SHOULD]{.bcp14} remove or replace fields
that are known to require removal before forwarding, whether or not they
appear as a connection-option, after applying those fields\' semantics.

Connection options do not always correspond to a field present in the

are no parameters associated with a connection option. In contrast, a
connection-specific field received without a corresponding connection
option usually indicates that the field has been improperly forwarded by
an intermediary and ought to be ignored by the

Each member of the Via field value represents a proxy or gateway that
has forwarded the message. Each intermediary appends its own information
about how the message was received, such that the end result is ordered
according to the sequence of forwarding
recipients.[¶](#section-7.6.3-3){.pilcrow}

A proxy [MUST]{.bcp14} send an appropriate Via header field, as

forwarded response messages.[¶](#section-7.6.3-4){.pilcrow}

For each intermediary, the received-protocol indicates the protocol and
protocol version used by the upstream sender of the message. Hence, the
Via field value records the advertised protocol capabilities of the
request/response chain such that they remain visible to downstream
recipients; this can be useful for determining what
backwards-incompatible features might be safe to use in response, or
within a later request, as described in [Section

The received-by portion is normally the host and optional port number of

However, if the real host is considered to be sensitive information, a

Some intermediaries include features for transforming messages and their
content. A proxy might, for example, convert between image formats in
order to save cache space or to reduce the amount of traffic on a slow
link. However, operational problems might occur when these
transformations are applied to content intended for critical
applications, such as medical imaging or scientific data analysis,
particularly when integrity checks or digital signatures are used to
ensure that the content received is identical to the
original.[¶](#section-7.7-1){.pilcrow}

An HTTP-to-HTTP proxy is called a \"transforming proxy\" if it is
designed or configured to modify messages in a semantically meaningful
way (i.e., modifications, beyond those required by normal HTTP
processing, that change the message in a way that would be significant
to the original sender or potentially significant to downstream
recipients). For example, a transforming proxy might be acting as a
shared annotation server (modifying responses to include references to a
local annotation database), a malware filter, a format transcoder, or a
privacy filter. Such transformations are presumed to be desired by
whichever client (or client organization) chose the
proxy.[¶](#section-7.7-2){.pilcrow}

If a proxy receives a target URI with a host name that is not a fully
qualified domain name, it [MAY]{.bcp14} add its own domain to the host
name it received when forwarding the request. A proxy [MUST NOT]{.bcp14}
change the host name if the target URI contains a fully qualified domain
name.[¶](#section-7.7-3){.pilcrow}

A proxy [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} modify the \"absolute-path\" and \"query\"
parts of the received target URI when forwarding it to the next inbound
server except as required by that forwarding protocol. For example, a
proxy forwarding a request to an origin server via HTTP/1.1 will replace
an empty path with \"/\" ([Section

The capabilities and nature of the application-level communication after

chosen. However, immediately after sending the [101 (Switching

continue responding to the original request as if it had received its

repeated).[¶](#section-7.8-10){.pilcrow}

For example, if the Upgrade header field is received in a GET request

[101 (Switching Protocols)](#status.101){.xref} message in HTTP/1.1 and
then immediately follows that with the new protocol\'s equivalent of a
response to a GET on the target resource. This allows a connection to be
upgraded to protocols with the same semantics as HTTP without the
latency cost of an additional round trip. A server [MUST NOT]{.bcp14}
switch protocols unless the received message semantics can be honored by
the new protocol; an OPTIONS request can be honored by any
protocol.[¶](#section-7.8-11){.pilcrow}

The following is an example response to the above hypothetical
request:[¶](#section-7.8-12){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-7.8-13}
``` {.lang-http-message .sourcecode}
HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols

(as defined by new protocol) to the "GET /hello" request ...]
```

[¶](#section-7.8-13){.pilcrow}
:::

A sender of Upgrade [MUST]{.bcp14} also send an \"Upgrade\" connection
option in the [Connection](#field.connection){.xref} header field
([Section 7.6.1](#field.connection){.xref}) to inform intermediaries not
to forward this field. A server that receives an Upgrade header field in
an HTTP/1.0 request [MUST]{.bcp14} ignore that Upgrade
field.[¶](#section-7.8-14){.pilcrow}

A client cannot begin using an upgraded protocol on the connection until
it has completely sent the request message (i.e., the client can\'t
change the protocol it is sending in the middle of a message). If a
server receives both an Upgrade and an [Expect](#field.expect){.xref}
header field with the \"100-continue\" expectation ([Section
10.1.1](#field.expect){.xref}), the server [MUST]{.bcp14} send a [100
(Continue)](#status.100){.xref} response before sending a [101
(Switching Protocols)](#status.101){.xref}
response.[¶](#section-7.8-15){.pilcrow}

The Upgrade header field only applies to switching protocols on top of
the existing connection; it cannot be used to switch the underlying
connection (transport) protocol, nor to switch the existing
communication to a different connection. For those purposes, it is more
appropriate to use a [3xx (Redirection)](#status.3xx){.xref} response
([Section 15.4](#status.3xx){.xref}).[¶](#section-7.8-16){.pilcrow}

Representation header fields provide metadata about the representation.
When a message includes content, the representation header fields
describe how to interpret that data. In a response to a HEAD request,

The \"Content-Type\" header field indicates the media type of the
associated representation: either the representation enclosed in the
message content or the [selected
representation](#selected.representation){.xref}, as determined by the
message semantics. The indicated media type defines both the data format
and how that data is intended to be processed by a recipient, within the

A sender that generates a message containing content [SHOULD]{.bcp14}
generate a Content-Type header field in that message unless the intended
media type of the enclosed representation is unknown to the sender. If a
Content-Type header field is not present, the recipient [MAY]{.bcp14}
either assume a media type of \"application/octet-stream\"
(\[[RFC2046](#RFC2046){.xref}\], [Section
4.5.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2046#section-4.5.1){.relref})
or examine the data to determine its type.[¶](#section-8.3-5){.pilcrow}

In practice, resource owners do not always properly configure their
origin server to provide the correct Content-Type for a given
representation. Some user agents examine the content and, in certain
cases, override the received type (for example, see
\[[Sniffing](#Sniffing){.xref}\]). This \"MIME sniffing\" risks drawing
incorrect conclusions about the data, which might expose the user to
additional security risks (e.g., \"privilege escalation\"). Furthermore,
distinct media types often share a common data format, differing only in
how the data is intended to be processed, which is impossible to
distinguish by inspecting the data alone. When sniffing is implemented,
implementers are encouraged to provide a means for the user to disable
it.[¶](#section-8.3-6){.pilcrow}

Although Content-Type is defined as a singleton field, it is sometimes
incorrectly generated multiple times, resulting in a combined field
value that appears to be a list. Recipients often attempt to handle this
error by using the last syntactically valid member of the list, leading
to potential interoperability and security issues if different
implementations have different error handling
behaviors.[¶](#section-8.3-7){.pilcrow}

order to obtain data in the media type referenced by the

If one or more encodings have been applied to a representation, the

Content-Encoding header field that lists the content codings in the
order in which they were applied. Note that the coding named
\"identity\" is reserved for its special role in

Additional information about the encoding parameters can be provided by

Unlike Transfer-Encoding ([Section
6.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9112#section-6.1){.relref} of
\[[HTTP/1.1](#HTTP11){.xref}\]), the codings listed in Content-Encoding
are a characteristic of the representation; the representation is
defined in terms of the coded form, and all other metadata about the
representation is about the coded form unless otherwise noted in the
metadata definition. Typically, the representation is only decoded just
prior to rendering or analogous usage.[¶](#section-8.4-7){.pilcrow}

If the media type includes an inherent encoding, such as a data format
that is always compressed, then that encoding would not be restated in
Content-Encoding even if it happens to be the same algorithm as one of
the content codings. Such a content coding would only be listed if, for
some bizarre reason, it is applied a second time to form the
representation. Likewise, an origin server might choose to publish the
same data as multiple representations that differ only in whether the
coding is defined as part of [Content-Type](#field.content-type){.xref}

their handling of each response (e.g., open a \"Save as \...\" dialog

A user agent [SHOULD]{.bcp14} send Content-Length in a request when the
method defines a meaning for enclosed content and it is not sending
Transfer-Encoding. For example, a user agent normally sends
Content-Length in a POST request even when the value is 0 (indicating
empty content). A user agent [SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} send a Content-Length
header field when the request message does not contain content and the
method semantics do not anticipate such
data.[¶](#section-8.6-5){.pilcrow}

A server [MAY]{.bcp14} send a Content-Length header field in a response
to a HEAD request ([Section 9.3.2](#HEAD){.xref}); a server [MUST
NOT]{.bcp14} send Content-Length in such a response unless its field
value equals the decimal number of octets that would have been sent in
the content of a response if the same request had used the GET
method.[¶](#section-8.6-6){.pilcrow}

A server [MAY]{.bcp14} send a Content-Length header field in a [304 (Not
Modified)](#status.304){.xref} response to a conditional GET request
([Section 15.4.5](#status.304){.xref}); a server [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} send
Content-Length in such a response unless its field value equals the
decimal number of octets that would have been sent in the content of a
[200 (OK)](#status.200){.xref} response to the same
request.[¶](#section-8.6-7){.pilcrow}

A server [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} send a Content-Length header field in any
response with a status code of [1xx (Informational)](#status.1xx){.xref}
or [204 (No Content)](#status.204){.xref}. A server [MUST NOT]{.bcp14}
send a Content-Length header field in any [2xx
(Successful)](#status.2xx){.xref} response to a CONNECT request
([Section 9.3.6](#CONNECT){.xref}).[¶](#section-8.6-8){.pilcrow}

Aside from the cases defined above, in the absence of Transfer-Encoding,
an origin server [SHOULD]{.bcp14} send a Content-Length header field
when the content size is known prior to sending the complete header
section. This will allow downstream recipients to measure transfer
progress, know when a received message is complete, and potentially
reuse the connection for additional
requests.[¶](#section-8.6-9){.pilcrow}

Any Content-Length field value greater than or equal to zero is valid.
Since there is no predefined limit to the length of content, a recipient
[MUST]{.bcp14} anticipate potentially large decimal numerals and prevent
parsing errors due to integer conversion overflows or precision loss due
to integer conversion ([Section
17.5](#attack.protocol.element.length){.xref}).[¶](#section-8.6-10){.pilcrow}

Because Content-Length is used for message delimitation in HTTP/1.1, its
field value can impact how the message is parsed by downstream
recipients even when the immediate connection is not using HTTP/1.1. If
the message is forwarded by a downstream intermediary, a Content-Length
field value that is inconsistent with the received message framing might
cause a security failure due to request smuggling or response
splitting.[¶](#section-8.6-11){.pilcrow}

As a result, a sender [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} forward a message with a
Content-Length header field value that is known to be
incorrect.[¶](#section-8.6-12){.pilcrow}

Likewise, a sender [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} forward a message with a
Content-Length header field value that does not match the ABNF above,
with one exception: a recipient of a Content-Length header field value
consisting of the same decimal value repeated as a comma-separated list
(e.g, \"Content-Length: 42, 42\") [MAY]{.bcp14} either reject the
message as invalid or replace that invalid field value with a single
instance of the decimal value, since this likely indicates that a
duplicate was generated or combined by an upstream message
processor.[¶](#section-8.6-13){.pilcrow}

The field value is either an [absolute-URI](#uri.references){.xref} or a
[partial-URI](#uri.references){.xref}. In the latter case ([Section
4](#uri){.xref}), the referenced URI is relative to the target URI
(\[[URI](#URI){.xref}\], [Section
5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986#section-5){.relref}).[¶](#section-8.7-3){.pilcrow}

The Content-Location value is not a replacement for the target URI
([Section 7.1](#target.resource){.xref}). It is representation metadata.
It has the same syntax and semantics as the header field of the same
name defined for MIME body parts in [Section
4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2557#section-4){.relref} of
\[[RFC2557](#RFC2557){.xref}\]. However, its appearance in an HTTP
message has some special implications for HTTP
recipients.[¶](#section-8.7-4){.pilcrow}

If Content-Location is included in a [2xx
(Successful)](#status.2xx){.xref} response message and its value refers
(after conversion to absolute form) to a URI that is the same as the
target URI, then the recipient [MAY]{.bcp14} consider the content to be
a current representation of that resource at the time indicated by the
message origination date. For a GET ([Section 9.3.1](#GET){.xref}) or
HEAD ([Section 9.3.2](#HEAD){.xref}) request, this is the same as the
default semantics when no Content-Location is provided by the server.
For a state-changing request like PUT ([Section 9.3.4](#PUT){.xref}) or
POST ([Section 9.3.3](#POST){.xref}), it implies that the server\'s
response contains the new representation of that resource, thereby
distinguishing it from representations that might only report about the
action (e.g., \"It worked!\"). This allows authoring applications to
update their local copies without the need for a subsequent GET
request.[¶](#section-8.7-5){.pilcrow}

If Content-Location is included in a [2xx
(Successful)](#status.2xx){.xref} response message and its field value
refers to a URI that differs from the target URI, then the origin server
claims that the URI is an identifier for a different resource
corresponding to the enclosed representation. Such a claim can only be
trusted if both identifiers share the same resource owner, which cannot
be programmatically determined via HTTP.[¶](#section-8.7-6){.pilcrow}

-   [For a response to a GET or HEAD request, this is an indication that
    the target URI refers to a resource that is subject to content
    negotiation and the Content-Location field value is a more specific
    identifier for the [selected

-   [For a [201 (Created)](#status.201){.xref} response to a
    state-changing method, a Content-Location field value that is
    identical to the [Location](#field.location){.xref} field value
    indicates that this content is a current representation of the newly
    created resource.[¶](#section-8.7-7.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-8.7-7.2}
-   [Otherwise, such a Content-Location indicates that this content is a
    representation reporting on the requested action\'s status and that
    the same report is available (for future access with GET) at the
    given URI. For example, a purchase transaction made via a POST
    request might include a receipt document as the content of the [200
    (OK)](#status.200){.xref} response; the Content-Location field value
    provides an identifier for retrieving a copy of that same receipt in
    the future.[¶](#section-8.7-7.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-8.7-7.3}

A user agent that sends Content-Location in a request message is stating
that its value refers to where the user agent originally obtained the
content of the enclosed representation (prior to any modifications made
by that user agent). In other words, the user agent is providing a back
link to the source of the original
representation.[¶](#section-8.7-8){.pilcrow}

An origin server that receives a Content-Location field in a request
message [MUST]{.bcp14} treat the information as transitory request
context rather than as metadata to be saved verbatim as part of the
representation. An origin server [MAY]{.bcp14} use that context to guide
in processing the request or to save it for other uses, such as within
source links or versioning metadata. However, an origin server [MUST
NOT]{.bcp14} use such context information to alter the request
semantics.[¶](#section-8.7-9){.pilcrow}

For example, if a client makes a PUT request on a negotiated resource
and the origin server accepts that PUT (without redirection), then the
new state of that resource is expected to be consistent with the one
representation supplied in that PUT; the Content-Location cannot be used
as a form of reverse content selection identifier to update only one of
the negotiated representations. If the user agent had wanted the latter
semantics, it would have applied the PUT directly to the
Content-Location URI.[¶](#section-8.7-10){.pilcrow}

Resource metadata is referred to as a \"validator\" if it can be used
within a precondition ([Section 13.1](#preconditions){.xref}) to make a
conditional request ([Section 13](#conditional.requests){.xref}).
Validator fields convey a current validator for the [selected
representation](#selected.representation){.xref} ([Section
3.2](#representations){.xref}).[¶](#section-8.8-1){.pilcrow}

In responses to safe requests, validator fields describe the selected
representation chosen by the origin server while handling the response.
Note that, depending on the method and status code semantics, the
selected representation for a given response is not necessarily the same
as the representation enclosed as response
content.[¶](#section-8.8-2){.pilcrow}

In a successful response to a state-changing request, validator fields
describe the new representation that has replaced the prior [selected
representation](#selected.representation){.xref} as a result of
processing the request.[¶](#section-8.8-3){.pilcrow}

For example, an ETag field in a [201 (Created)](#status.201){.xref}
response communicates the entity tag of the newly created resource\'s
representation, so that the entity tag can be used as a validator in
later conditional requests to prevent the \"lost update\"
problem.[¶](#section-8.8-4){.pilcrow}

This specification defines two forms of metadata that are commonly used
to observe resource state and test for preconditions: modification dates
([Section 8.8.2](#field.last-modified){.xref}) and opaque entity tags
([Section 8.8.3](#field.etag){.xref}). Additional metadata that reflects
resource state has been defined by various extensions of HTTP, such as
Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning \[[WEBDAV](#WEBDAV){.xref}\],
that are beyond the scope of this
specification.[¶](#section-8.8-5){.pilcrow}

[]{#iref-validator-weak-200 .iref} []{#iref-validator-strong-201 .iref}

Validators come in two flavors: strong or weak. Weak validators are easy
to generate but are far less useful for comparisons. Strong validators
are ideal for comparisons but can be very difficult (and occasionally
impossible) to generate efficiently. Rather than impose that all forms
of resource adhere to the same strength of validator, HTTP exposes the
type of validator in use and imposes restrictions on when weak
validators can be used as preconditions.[¶](#section-8.8.1-1){.pilcrow}

A \"strong validator\" is representation metadata that changes value
whenever a change occurs to the representation data that would be
observable in the content of a [200 (OK)](#status.200){.xref} response
to GET.[¶](#section-8.8.1-2){.pilcrow}

A strong validator might change for reasons other than a change to the
representation data, such as when a semantically significant part of the
representation metadata is changed (e.g.,
[Content-Type](#field.content-type){.xref}), but it is in the best
interests of the origin server to only change the value when it is
necessary to invalidate the stored responses held by remote caches and
authoring tools.[¶](#section-8.8.1-3){.pilcrow}

Cache entries might persist for arbitrarily long periods, regardless of
expiration times. Thus, a cache might attempt to validate an entry using
a validator that it obtained in the distant past. A strong validator is
unique across all versions of all representations associated with a
particular resource over time. However, there is no implication of
uniqueness across representations of different resources (i.e., the same
strong validator might be in use for representations of multiple
resources at the same time and does not imply that those representations
are equivalent).[¶](#section-8.8.1-4){.pilcrow}

There are a variety of strong validators used in practice. The best are
based on strict revision control, wherein each change to a
representation always results in a unique node name and revision
identifier being assigned before the representation is made accessible
to GET. A collision-resistant hash function applied to the
representation data is also sufficient if the data is available prior to
the response header fields being sent and the digest does not need to be
recalculated every time a validation request is received. However, if a
resource has distinct representations that differ only in their
metadata, such as might occur with content negotiation over media types
that happen to share the same data format, then the origin server needs
to incorporate additional information in the validator to distinguish
those representations.[¶](#section-8.8.1-5){.pilcrow}

In contrast, a \"weak validator\" is representation metadata that might
not change for every change to the representation data. This weakness
might be due to limitations in how the value is calculated (e.g., clock
resolution), an inability to ensure uniqueness for all possible
representations of the resource, or a desire of the resource owner to
group representations by some self-determined set of equivalency rather
than unique sequences of data.[¶](#section-8.8.1-6){.pilcrow}

An origin server [SHOULD]{.bcp14} change a weak entity tag whenever it
considers prior representations to be unacceptable as a substitute for
the current representation. In other words, a weak entity tag ought to
change whenever the origin server wants caches to invalidate old
responses.[¶](#section-8.8.1-7){.pilcrow}

For example, the representation of a weather report that changes in
content every second, based on dynamic measurements, might be grouped
into sets of equivalent representations (from the origin server\'s
perspective) with the same weak validator in order to allow cached
representations to be valid for a reasonable period of time (perhaps
adjusted dynamically based on server load or weather quality). Likewise,
a representation\'s modification time, if defined with only one-second
resolution, might be a weak validator if it is possible for the
representation to be modified twice during a single second and retrieved
between those modifications.[¶](#section-8.8.1-8){.pilcrow}

Likewise, a validator is weak if it is shared by two or more
representations of a given resource at the same time, unless those
representations have identical representation data. For example, if the
origin server sends the same validator for a representation with a gzip
content coding applied as it does for a representation with no content
coding, then that validator is weak. However, two simultaneous
representations might share the same strong validator if they differ
only in the representation metadata, such as when two different media
types are available for the same representation
data.[¶](#section-8.8.1-9){.pilcrow}

Strong validators are usable for all conditional requests, including
cache validation, partial content ranges, and \"lost update\" avoidance.
Weak validators are only usable when the client does not require exact
equality with previously obtained representation data, such as when
validating a cache entry or limiting a web traversal to recent
changes.[¶](#section-8.8.1-10){.pilcrow}

An origin server [SHOULD]{.bcp14} obtain the Last-Modified value of the
representation as close as possible to the time that it generates the

recipient to make an accurate assessment of the representation\'s

date that is later than the server\'s time of message origination
([Date](#field.date){.xref}, [Section 6.6.1](#field.date){.xref}). If
the last modification time is derived from implementation-specific
metadata that evaluates to some time in the future, according to the

The principle behind entity tags is that only the service author knows
the implementation of a resource well enough to select the most accurate
and efficient validation mechanism for that resource, and that any such
mechanism can be mapped to a simple sequence of octets for easy
comparison. Since the value is opaque, there is no need for the client
to be aware of how each entity tag is
constructed.[¶](#section-8.8.3.1-1){.pilcrow}

For example, a resource that has implementation-specific versioning
applied to all changes might use an internal revision number, perhaps
combined with a variance identifier for content negotiation, to
accurately differentiate between representations. Other implementations
might use a collision-resistant hash of representation content, a
combination of various file attributes, or a modification timestamp that
has sub-second resolution.[¶](#section-8.8.3.1-2){.pilcrow}

The request method token is the primary source of request semantics; it
indicates the purpose for which the client has made this request and
what is expected by the client as a successful
result.[¶](#section-9.1-1){.pilcrow}

The request method\'s semantics might be further specialized by the
semantics of some header fields when present in a request if those
additional semantics do not conflict with the method. For example, a
client can send conditional request header fields ([Section
13.1](#preconditions){.xref}) to make the requested action conditional
on the current state of the target
resource.[¶](#section-9.1-2){.pilcrow}

HTTP is designed to be usable as an interface to distributed object
systems. The request method invokes an action to be applied to a [target
resource](#target.resource){.xref} in much the same way that a remote
method invocation can be sent to an identified
object.[¶](#section-9.1-3){.pilcrow}

[¶](#section-9.1-4){.pilcrow}
:::

The method token is case-sensitive because it might be used as a gateway
to object-based systems with case-sensitive method names. By convention,
standardized methods are defined in all-uppercase US-ASCII
letters.[¶](#section-9.1-5){.pilcrow}

Unlike distributed objects, the standardized request methods in HTTP are
not resource-specific, since uniform interfaces provide for better
visibility and reuse in network-based systems \[[REST](#REST){.xref}\].
Once defined, a standardized method ought to have the same semantics
when applied to any resource, though each resource determines for itself
whether those semantics are implemented or
allowed.[¶](#section-9.1-6){.pilcrow}

This specification defines a number of standardized methods that are
commonly used in HTTP, as outlined by the following

The set of methods allowed by a target resource can be listed in an
[Allow](#field.allow){.xref} header field ([Section
10.2.1](#field.allow){.xref}). However, the set of allowed methods can
change dynamically. An origin server that receives a request method that
is unrecognized or not implemented [SHOULD]{.bcp14} respond with the

[]{#iref-safe-216 .iref}

Request methods are considered \"safe\" if their defined semantics are
essentially read-only; i.e., the client does not request, and does not
expect, any state change on the origin server as a result of applying a
safe method to a target resource. Likewise, reasonable use of a safe
method is not expected to cause any harm, loss of property, or unusual
burden on the origin server.[¶](#section-9.2.1-1){.pilcrow}

This definition of safe methods does not prevent an implementation from
including behavior that is potentially harmful, that is not entirely
read-only, or that causes side effects while invoking a safe method.
What is important, however, is that the client did not request that
additional behavior and cannot be held accountable for it. For example,
most servers append request information to access log files at the
completion of every response, regardless of the method, and that is
considered safe even though the log storage might become full and cause
the server to fail. Likewise, a safe request initiated by selecting an
advertisement on the Web will often have the side effect of charging an
advertising account.[¶](#section-9.2.1-2){.pilcrow}

Of the request methods defined by this specification, the
[GET](#GET){.xref}, [HEAD](#HEAD){.xref}, [OPTIONS](#OPTIONS){.xref},
and [TRACE](#TRACE){.xref} methods are defined to be
safe.[¶](#section-9.2.1-3){.pilcrow}

The purpose of distinguishing between safe and unsafe methods is to
allow automated retrieval processes (spiders) and cache performance
optimization (pre-fetching) to work without fear of causing harm. In
addition, it allows a user agent to apply appropriate constraints on the
automated use of unsafe methods when processing potentially untrusted
content.[¶](#section-9.2.1-4){.pilcrow}

A user agent [SHOULD]{.bcp14} distinguish between safe and unsafe
methods when presenting potential actions to a user, such that the user
can be made aware of an unsafe action before it is
requested.[¶](#section-9.2.1-5){.pilcrow}

When a resource is constructed such that parameters within the target
URI have the effect of selecting an action, it is the resource owner\'s
responsibility to ensure that the action is consistent with the request
method semantics. For example, it is common for Web-based content
editing software to use actions within query parameters, such as
\"page?do=delete\". If the purpose of such a resource is to perform an
unsafe action, then the resource owner [MUST]{.bcp14} disable or
disallow that action when it is accessed using a safe request method.
Failure to do so will result in unfortunate side effects when automated
processes perform a GET on every URI reference for the sake of link
maintenance, pre-fetching, building a search index,
etc.[¶](#section-9.2.1-6){.pilcrow}

[]{#iref-idempotent-217 .iref}

A request method is considered \"idempotent\" if the intended effect on
the server of multiple identical requests with that method is the same
as the effect for a single such request. Of the request methods defined
by this specification, [PUT](#PUT){.xref}, [DELETE](#DELETE){.xref}, and
safe request methods are idempotent.[¶](#section-9.2.2-1){.pilcrow}

Like the definition of safe, the idempotent property only applies to
what has been requested by the user; a server is free to log each
request separately, retain a revision control history, or implement
other non-idempotent side effects for each idempotent
request.[¶](#section-9.2.2-2){.pilcrow}

Idempotent methods are distinguished because the request can be repeated
automatically if a communication failure occurs before the client is
able to read the server\'s response. For example, if a client sends a
PUT request and the underlying connection is closed before any response
is received, then the client can establish a new connection and retry
the idempotent request. It knows that repeating the request will have
the same intended effect, even if the original request succeeded, though
the response might differ.[¶](#section-9.2.2-3){.pilcrow}

A client [SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} automatically retry a request with a
non-idempotent method unless it has some means to know that the request
semantics are actually idempotent, regardless of the method, or some
means to detect that the original request was never
applied.[¶](#section-9.2.2-4){.pilcrow}

For example, a user agent can repeat a POST request automatically if it
knows (through design or configuration) that the request is safe for
that resource. Likewise, a user agent designed specifically to operate
on a version control repository might be able to recover from partial
failure conditions by checking the target resource revision(s) after a
failed connection, reverting or fixing any changes that were partially
applied, and then automatically retrying the requests that
failed.[¶](#section-9.2.2-5){.pilcrow}

Some clients take a riskier approach and attempt to guess when an
automatic retry is possible. For example, a client might automatically
retry a POST request if the underlying transport connection closed
before any part of a response is received, particularly if an idle
persistent connection was used.[¶](#section-9.2.2-6){.pilcrow}

A proxy [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} automatically retry non-idempotent requests.
A client [SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} automatically retry a failed automatic

[]{#iref-get-method-218 .iref} []{#iref-method-get-219 .iref}

The GET method requests transfer of a current [selected
representation](#selected.representation){.xref} for the [target
resource](#target.resource){.xref}. A successful response reflects the
quality of \"sameness\" identified by the target URI ([Section
1.2.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986#section-1.2.2){.relref} of
\[[URI](#URI){.xref}\]). Hence, retrieving identifiable information via
HTTP is usually performed by making a GET request on an identifier
associated with the potential for providing that information in a [200
(OK)](#status.200){.xref} response.[¶](#section-9.3.1-1){.pilcrow}

GET is the primary mechanism of information retrieval and the focus of
almost all performance optimizations. Applications that produce a URI
for each important resource can benefit from those optimizations while
enabling their reuse by other applications, creating a network effect
that promotes further expansion of the
Web.[¶](#section-9.3.1-2){.pilcrow}

It is tempting to think of resource identifiers as remote file system
pathnames and of representations as being a copy of the contents of such
files. In fact, that is how many resources are implemented (see [Section
17.3](#attack.pathname){.xref} for related security considerations).
However, there are no such limitations in
practice.[¶](#section-9.3.1-3){.pilcrow}

The HTTP interface for a resource is just as likely to be implemented as
a tree of content objects, a programmatic view on various database
records, or a gateway to other information systems. Even when the URI
mapping mechanism is tied to a file system, an origin server might be
configured to execute the files with the request as input and send the
output as the representation rather than transfer the files directly.
Regardless, only the origin server needs to know how each resource
identifier corresponds to an implementation and how that implementation
manages to select and send a current representation of the target
resource.[¶](#section-9.3.1-4){.pilcrow}

A client can alter the semantics of GET to be a \"range request\",
requesting transfer of only some part(s) of the selected representation,
by sending a [Range](#field.range){.xref} header field in the request
([Section 14.2](#field.range){.xref}).[¶](#section-9.3.1-5){.pilcrow}

Although request message framing is independent of the method used,
content received in a GET request has no generally defined semantics,
cannot alter the meaning or target of the request, and might lead some
implementations to reject the request and close the connection because
of its potential as a request smuggling attack ([Section
11.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9112#section-11.2){.relref} of
\[[HTTP/1.1](#HTTP11){.xref}\]). A client [SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} generate
content in a GET request unless it is made directly to an origin server
that has previously indicated, in or out of band, that such a request
has a purpose and will be adequately supported. An origin server [SHOULD
NOT]{.bcp14} rely on private agreements to receive content, since
participants in HTTP communication are often unaware of intermediaries
along the request chain.[¶](#section-9.3.1-6){.pilcrow}

The response to a GET request is cacheable; a cache [MAY]{.bcp14} use it
to satisfy subsequent GET and HEAD requests unless otherwise indicated
by the Cache-Control header field ([Section
5.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111#section-5.2){.relref} of
\[[CACHING](#CACHING){.xref}\]).[¶](#section-9.3.1-7){.pilcrow}

When information retrieval is performed with a mechanism that constructs
a target URI from user-provided information, such as the query fields of
a form using GET, potentially sensitive data might be provided that
would not be appropriate for disclosure within a URI (see [Section
17.9](#sensitive.information.in.uris){.xref}). In some cases, the data
can be filtered or transformed such that it would not reveal such
information. In others, particularly when there is no benefit from
caching a response, using the POST method ([Section
9.3.3](#POST){.xref}) instead of GET can transmit such information in
the request content rather than within the target
URI.[¶](#section-9.3.1-8){.pilcrow}

The HEAD method is identical to GET except that the server [MUST
NOT]{.bcp14} send content in the response. HEAD is used to obtain
metadata about the [selected
representation](#selected.representation){.xref} without transferring
its representation data, often for the sake of testing hypertext links
or finding recent modifications.[¶](#section-9.3.2-1){.pilcrow}

The server [SHOULD]{.bcp14} send the same header fields in response to a
HEAD request as it would have sent if the request method had been GET.
However, a server [MAY]{.bcp14} omit header fields for which a value is
determined only while generating the content. For example, some servers
buffer a dynamic response to GET until a minimum amount of data is
generated so that they can more efficiently delimit small responses or
make late decisions with regard to content selection. Such a response to
GET might contain [Content-Length](#field.content-length){.xref} and
[Vary](#field.vary){.xref} fields, for example, that are not generated
within a HEAD response. These minor inconsistencies are considered
preferable to generating and discarding the content for a HEAD request,
since HEAD is usually requested for the sake of
efficiency.[¶](#section-9.3.2-2){.pilcrow}

Although request message framing is independent of the method used,
content received in a HEAD request has no generally defined semantics,
cannot alter the meaning or target of the request, and might lead some
implementations to reject the request and close the connection because
of its potential as a request smuggling attack ([Section
11.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9112#section-11.2){.relref} of

The POST method requests that the [target

example, POST is used for the following functions (among
others):[¶](#section-9.3.3-1){.pilcrow}

-   [Appending data to a resource\'s existing
    representation(s).[¶](#section-9.3.3-2.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-9.3.3-2.4}

An origin server indicates response semantics by choosing an appropriate
status code depending on the result of processing the POST request;
almost all of the status codes defined by this specification could be
received in a response to POST (the exceptions being [206 (Partial
Content)](#status.206){.xref}, [304 (Not Modified)](#status.304){.xref},
and [416 (Range Not
Satisfiable)](#status.416){.xref}).[¶](#section-9.3.3-3){.pilcrow}

If one or more resources has been created on the origin server as a
result of successfully processing a POST request, the origin server
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} send a [201 (Created)](#status.201){.xref} response
containing a [Location](#field.location){.xref} header field that
provides an identifier for the primary resource created ([Section
10.2.2](#field.location){.xref}) and a representation that describes the
status of the request while referring to the new
resource(s).[¶](#section-9.3.3-4){.pilcrow}

Responses to POST requests are only cacheable when they include explicit
freshness information (see [Section
4.2.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111#section-4.2.1){.relref} of
\[[CACHING](#CACHING){.xref}\]) and a
[Content-Location](#field.content-location){.xref} header field that has
the same value as the POST\'s target URI ([Section
8.7](#field.content-location){.xref}). A cached POST response can be
reused to satisfy a later GET or HEAD request. In contrast, a POST
request cannot be satisfied by a cached POST response because POST is
potentially unsafe; see [Section
4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111#section-4){.relref} of
\[[CACHING](#CACHING){.xref}\].[¶](#section-9.3.3-5){.pilcrow}

If the result of processing a POST would be equivalent to a
representation of an existing resource, an origin server [MAY]{.bcp14}
redirect the user agent to that resource by sending a [303 (See
Other)](#status.303){.xref} response with the existing resource\'s
identifier in the [Location](#field.location){.xref} field. This has the
benefits of providing the user agent a resource identifier and
transferring the representation via a method more amenable to shared
caching, though at the cost of an extra request if the user agent does
not already have the representation
cached.[¶](#section-9.3.3-6){.pilcrow}

[]{#iref-put-method-224 .iref} []{#iref-method-put-225 .iref}

The PUT method requests that the state of the [target
resource](#target.resource){.xref} be created or replaced with the state
defined by the representation enclosed in the request message content. A
successful PUT of a given representation would suggest that a subsequent
GET on that same target resource will result in an equivalent
representation being sent in a [200 (OK)](#status.200){.xref} response.
However, there is no guarantee that such a state change will be
observable, since the target resource might be acted upon by other user
agents in parallel, or might be subject to dynamic processing by the
origin server, before any subsequent GET is received. A successful
response only implies that the user agent\'s intent was achieved at the
time of its processing by the origin
server.[¶](#section-9.3.4-1){.pilcrow}

If the target resource does not have a current representation and the
PUT successfully creates one, then the origin server [MUST]{.bcp14}
inform the user agent by sending a [201 (Created)](#status.201){.xref}
response. If the target resource does have a current representation and
that representation is successfully modified in accordance with the
state of the enclosed representation, then the origin server
[MUST]{.bcp14} send either a [200 (OK)](#status.200){.xref} or a [204
(No Content)](#status.204){.xref} response to indicate successful
completion of the request.[¶](#section-9.3.4-2){.pilcrow}

An origin server [SHOULD]{.bcp14} verify that the PUT representation is
consistent with its configured constraints for the target resource. For
example, if an origin server determines a resource\'s representation
metadata based on the URI, then the origin server needs to ensure that
the content received in a successful PUT request is consistent with that
metadata. When a PUT representation is inconsistent with the target
resource, the origin server [SHOULD]{.bcp14} either make them
consistent, by transforming the representation or changing the resource
configuration, or respond with an appropriate error message containing
sufficient information to explain why the representation is unsuitable.
The [409 (Conflict)](#status.409){.xref} or [415 (Unsupported Media
Type)](#status.415){.xref} status codes are suggested, with the latter
being specific to constraints on
[Content-Type](#field.content-type){.xref}
values.[¶](#section-9.3.4-3){.pilcrow}

For example, if the target resource is configured to always have a
[Content-Type](#field.content-type){.xref} of \"text/html\" and the
representation being PUT has a Content-Type of \"image/jpeg\", the
origin server ought to do one of:[¶](#section-9.3.4-4){.pilcrow}

a.  [reconfigure the target resource to reflect the new media
    type;[¶](#section-9.3.4-5.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-9.3.4-5.1}
b.  [transform the PUT representation to a format consistent with that
    of the resource before saving it as the new resource state;
    or,[¶](#section-9.3.4-5.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-9.3.4-5.2}
c.  [reject the request with a [415 (Unsupported Media
    Type)](#status.415){.xref} response indicating that the target
    resource is limited to \"text/html\", perhaps including a link to a
    different resource that would be a suitable target for the new
    representation.[¶](#section-9.3.4-5.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-9.3.4-5.3}

HTTP does not define exactly how a PUT method affects the state of an
origin server beyond what can be expressed by the intent of the user
agent request and the semantics of the origin server response. It does
not define what a resource might be, in any sense of that word, beyond
the interface provided via HTTP. It does not define how resource state
is \"stored\", nor how such storage might change as a result of a change
in resource state, nor how the origin server translates resource state
into representations. Generally speaking, all implementation details
behind the resource interface are intentionally hidden by the
server.[¶](#section-9.3.4-6){.pilcrow}

This extends to how header and trailer fields are stored; while common
header fields like [Content-Type](#field.content-type){.xref} will
typically be stored and returned upon subsequent GET requests, header
and trailer field handling is specific to the resource that received the
request. As a result, an origin server [SHOULD]{.bcp14} ignore
unrecognized header and trailer fields received in a PUT request (i.e.,
not save them as part of the resource
state).[¶](#section-9.3.4-7){.pilcrow}

An origin server [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} send a validator field ([Section
8.8](#response.validator){.xref}), such as an [ETag](#field.etag){.xref}
or [Last-Modified](#field.last-modified){.xref} field, in a successful
response to PUT unless the request\'s representation data was saved
without any transformation applied to the content (i.e., the resource\'s
new representation data is identical to the content received in the PUT
request) and the validator field value reflects the new representation.
This requirement allows a user agent to know when the representation it
sent (and retains in memory) is the result of the PUT, and thus it
doesn\'t need to be retrieved again from the origin server. The new
validator(s) received in the response can be used for future conditional
requests in order to prevent accidental overwrites ([Section
13.1](#preconditions){.xref}).[¶](#section-9.3.4-8){.pilcrow}

The fundamental difference between the POST and PUT methods is
highlighted by the different intent for the enclosed representation. The
target resource in a POST request is intended to handle the enclosed
representation according to the resource\'s own semantics, whereas the
enclosed representation in a PUT request is defined as replacing the
state of the target resource. Hence, the intent of PUT is idempotent and
visible to intermediaries, even though the exact effect is only known by
the origin server.[¶](#section-9.3.4-9){.pilcrow}

Proper interpretation of a PUT request presumes that the user agent
knows which target resource is desired. A service that selects a proper
URI on behalf of the client, after receiving a state-changing request,
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} be implemented using the POST method rather than PUT.
If the origin server will not make the requested PUT state change to the
target resource and instead wishes to have it applied to a different
resource, such as when the resource has been moved to a different URI,
then the origin server [MUST]{.bcp14} send an appropriate [3xx
(Redirection)](#status.3xx){.xref} response; the user agent
[MAY]{.bcp14} then make its own decision regarding whether or not to
redirect the request.[¶](#section-9.3.4-10){.pilcrow}

A PUT request applied to the target resource can have side effects on
other resources. For example, an article might have a URI for
identifying \"the current version\" (a resource) that is separate from
the URIs identifying each particular version (different resources that
at one point shared the same state as the current version resource). A
successful PUT request on \"the current version\" URI might therefore
create a new version resource in addition to changing the state of the
target resource, and might also cause links to be added between the
related resources.[¶](#section-9.3.4-11){.pilcrow}

Some origin servers support use of the
[Content-Range](#field.content-range){.xref} header field ([Section
14.4](#field.content-range){.xref}) as a request modifier to perform a
partial PUT, as described in [Section
14.5](#partial.PUT){.xref}.[¶](#section-9.3.4-12){.pilcrow}

Responses to the PUT method are not cacheable. If a successful PUT
request passes through a cache that has one or more stored responses for
the target URI, those stored responses will be invalidated (see [Section
4.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111#section-4.4){.relref} of
\[[CACHING](#CACHING){.xref}\]).[¶](#section-9.3.4-13){.pilcrow}

#### [9.3.5.](#section-9.3.5){.section-number .selfRef} [DELETE](#name-delete){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-delete}

[]{#iref-delete-method-226 .iref} []{#iref-method-delete-227 .iref}

The DELETE method requests that the origin server remove the association
between the [target resource](#target.resource){.xref} and its current
functionality. In effect, this method is similar to the \"rm\" command
in UNIX: it expresses a deletion operation on the URI mapping of the
origin server rather than an expectation that the previously associated
information be deleted.[¶](#section-9.3.5-1){.pilcrow}

If the target resource has one or more current representations, they
might or might not be destroyed by the origin server, and the associated
storage might or might not be reclaimed, depending entirely on the
nature of the resource and its implementation by the origin server
(which are beyond the scope of this specification). Likewise, other
implementation aspects of a resource might need to be deactivated or
archived as a result of a DELETE, such as database or gateway
connections. In general, it is assumed that the origin server will only
allow DELETE on resources for which it has a prescribed mechanism for
accomplishing the deletion.[¶](#section-9.3.5-2){.pilcrow}

Relatively few resources allow the DELETE method \-- its primary use is
for remote authoring environments, where the user has some direction
regarding its effect. For example, a resource that was previously
created using a PUT request, or identified via the Location header field
after a [201 (Created)](#status.201){.xref} response to a POST request,
might allow a corresponding DELETE request to undo those actions.
Similarly, custom user agent implementations that implement an authoring
function, such as revision control clients using HTTP for remote
operations, might use DELETE based on an assumption that the server\'s
URI space has been crafted to correspond to a version
repository.[¶](#section-9.3.5-3){.pilcrow}

If a DELETE method is successfully applied, the origin server
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} send[¶](#section-9.3.5-4){.pilcrow}

-   [a [202 (Accepted)](#status.202){.xref} status code if the action
    will likely succeed but has not yet been
    enacted,[¶](#section-9.3.5-5.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-9.3.5-5.1}
-   [a [204 (No Content)](#status.204){.xref} status code if the action
    has been enacted and no further information is to be supplied,
    or[¶](#section-9.3.5-5.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-9.3.5-5.2}
-   [a [200 (OK)](#status.200){.xref} status code if the action has been
    enacted and the response message includes a representation
    describing the
    status.[¶](#section-9.3.5-5.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-9.3.5-5.3}

Although request message framing is independent of the method used,
content received in a DELETE request has no generally defined semantics,
cannot alter the meaning or target of the request, and might lead some
implementations to reject the request and close the connection because
of its potential as a request smuggling attack ([Section
11.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9112#section-11.2){.relref} of
\[[HTTP/1.1](#HTTP11){.xref}\]). A client [SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} generate
content in a DELETE request unless it is made directly to an origin
server that has previously indicated, in or out of band, that such a
request has a purpose and will be adequately supported. An origin server
[SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} rely on private agreements to receive content,
since participants in HTTP communication are often unaware of
intermediaries along the request chain.[¶](#section-9.3.5-6){.pilcrow}

Responses to the DELETE method are not cacheable. If a successful DELETE
request passes through a cache that has one or more stored responses for
the target URI, those stored responses will be invalidated (see [Section
4.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111#section-4.4){.relref} of

[]{#iref-connect-method-228 .iref} []{#iref-method-connect-229 .iref}

The CONNECT method requests that the recipient establish a tunnel to the
destination origin server identified by the request target and, if
successful, thereafter restrict its behavior to blind forwarding of
data, in both directions, until the tunnel is closed. Tunnels are
commonly used to create an end-to-end virtual connection, through one or
more proxies, which can then be secured using TLS (Transport Layer
Security, \[[TLS13](#TLS13){.xref}\]).[¶](#section-9.3.6-1){.pilcrow}

CONNECT uses a special form of request target, unique to this method,
consisting of only the host and port number of the tunnel destination,
separated by a colon. There is no default port; a client [MUST]{.bcp14}
send the port number even if the CONNECT request is based on a URI
reference that contains an authority component with an elided port
([Section 4.1](#uri.references){.xref}). For
example,[¶](#section-9.3.6-2){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-9.3.6-3}
``` {.lang-http-message .sourcecode}
CONNECT server.example.com:80 HTTP/1.1
Host: server.example.com
```

[¶](#section-9.3.6-3){.pilcrow}
:::

A server [MUST]{.bcp14} reject a CONNECT request that targets an empty
or invalid port number, typically by responding with a 400 (Bad Request)
status code.[¶](#section-9.3.6-4){.pilcrow}

Because CONNECT changes the request/response nature of an HTTP
connection, specific HTTP versions might have different ways of mapping
its semantics into the protocol\'s wire
format.[¶](#section-9.3.6-5){.pilcrow}

CONNECT is intended for use in requests to a proxy. The recipient can
establish a tunnel either by directly connecting to the server
identified by the request target or, if configured to use another proxy,
by forwarding the CONNECT request to the next inbound proxy. An origin
server [MAY]{.bcp14} accept a CONNECT request, but most origin servers
do not implement CONNECT.[¶](#section-9.3.6-6){.pilcrow}

Any [2xx (Successful)](#status.2xx){.xref} response indicates that the
sender (and all inbound proxies) will switch to tunnel mode immediately
after the response header section; data received after that header
section is from the server identified by the request target. Any
response other than a successful response indicates that the tunnel has
not yet been formed.[¶](#section-9.3.6-7){.pilcrow}

A tunnel is closed when a tunnel intermediary detects that either side
has closed its connection: the intermediary [MUST]{.bcp14} attempt to
send any outstanding data that came from the closed side to the other
side, close both connections, and then discard any remaining data left
undelivered.[¶](#section-9.3.6-8){.pilcrow}

Proxy authentication might be used to establish the authority to create
a tunnel. For example,[¶](#section-9.3.6-9){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-9.3.6-10}
``` {.lang-http-message .sourcecode}
CONNECT server.example.com:443 HTTP/1.1
Host: server.example.com:443
Proxy-Authorization: basic aGVsbG86d29ybGQ=
```

[¶](#section-9.3.6-10){.pilcrow}
:::

There are significant risks in establishing a tunnel to arbitrary
servers, particularly when the destination is a well-known or reserved
TCP port that is not intended for Web traffic. For example, a CONNECT to
\"example.com:25\" would suggest that the proxy connect to the reserved
port for SMTP traffic; if allowed, that could trick the proxy into
relaying spam email. Proxies that support CONNECT [SHOULD]{.bcp14}
restrict its use to a limited set of known ports or a configurable list
of safe request targets.[¶](#section-9.3.6-11){.pilcrow}

A server [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} send any Transfer-Encoding or
[Content-Length](#field.content-length){.xref} header fields in a [2xx
(Successful)](#status.2xx){.xref} response to CONNECT. A client
[MUST]{.bcp14} ignore any Content-Length or Transfer-Encoding header
fields received in a successful response to
CONNECT.[¶](#section-9.3.6-12){.pilcrow}

A CONNECT request message does not have content. The interpretation of
data sent after the header section of the CONNECT request message is
specific to the version of HTTP in use.[¶](#section-9.3.6-13){.pilcrow}

[]{#iref-options-method-230 .iref} []{#iref-method-options-231 .iref}

The OPTIONS method requests information about the communication options
available for the target resource, at either the origin server or an
intervening intermediary. This method allows a client to determine the
options and/or requirements associated with a resource, or the
capabilities of a server, without implying a resource
action.[¶](#section-9.3.7-1){.pilcrow}

An OPTIONS request with an asterisk (\"\*\") as the request target
([Section 7.1](#target.resource){.xref}) applies to the server in
general rather than to a specific resource. Since a server\'s
communication options typically depend on the resource, the \"\*\"
request is only useful as a \"ping\" or \"no-op\" type of method; it
does nothing beyond allowing the client to test the capabilities of the
server. For example, this can be used to test a proxy for HTTP/1.1
conformance (or lack thereof).[¶](#section-9.3.7-2){.pilcrow}

If the request target is not an asterisk, the OPTIONS request applies to
the options that are available when communicating with the target
resource.[¶](#section-9.3.7-3){.pilcrow}

A server generating a successful response to OPTIONS [SHOULD]{.bcp14}
send any header that might indicate optional features implemented by the
server and applicable to the target resource (e.g.,
[Allow](#field.allow){.xref}), including potential extensions not
defined by this specification. The response content, if any, might also
describe the communication options in a machine or human-readable
representation. A standard format for such a representation is not
defined by this specification, but might be defined by future extensions
to HTTP.[¶](#section-9.3.7-4){.pilcrow}

A client [MAY]{.bcp14} send a [Max-Forwards](#field.max-forwards){.xref}
header field in an OPTIONS request to target a specific recipient in the
request chain (see [Section 7.6.2](#field.max-forwards){.xref}). A proxy
[MUST NOT]{.bcp14} generate a Max-Forwards header field while forwarding
a request unless that request was received with a Max-Forwards
field.[¶](#section-9.3.7-5){.pilcrow}

A client that generates an OPTIONS request containing content
[MUST]{.bcp14} send a valid [Content-Type](#field.content-type){.xref}
header field describing the representation media type. Note that this
specification does not define any use for such
content.[¶](#section-9.3.7-6){.pilcrow}

[]{#iref-trace-method-232 .iref} []{#iref-method-trace-233 .iref}

The TRACE method requests a remote, application-level loop-back of the
request message. The final recipient of the request [SHOULD]{.bcp14}
reflect the message received, excluding some fields described below,
back to the client as the content of a [200 (OK)](#status.200){.xref}
response. The \"message/http\" format ([Section
10.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9112#section-10.1){.relref} of
\[[HTTP/1.1](#HTTP11){.xref}\]) is one way to do so. The final recipient
is either the origin server or the first server to receive a
[Max-Forwards](#field.max-forwards){.xref} value of zero (0) in the
request ([Section
7.6.2](#field.max-forwards){.xref}).[¶](#section-9.3.8-1){.pilcrow}

A client [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} generate fields in a TRACE request
containing sensitive data that might be disclosed by the response. For
example, it would be foolish for a user agent to send stored user
credentials ([Section 11](#authentication){.xref}) or cookies
\[[COOKIE](#COOKIE){.xref}\] in a TRACE request. The final recipient of
the request [SHOULD]{.bcp14} exclude any request fields that are likely
to contain sensitive data when that recipient generates the response
content.[¶](#section-9.3.8-2){.pilcrow}

TRACE allows the client to see what is being received at the other end
of the request chain and use that data for testing or diagnostic
information. The value of the [Via](#field.via){.xref} header field
([Section 7.6.3](#field.via){.xref}) is of particular interest, since it
acts as a trace of the request chain. Use of the
[Max-Forwards](#field.max-forwards){.xref} header field allows the
client to limit the length of the request chain, which is useful for
testing a chain of proxies forwarding messages in an infinite
loop.[¶](#section-9.3.8-3){.pilcrow}

receive a [100 (Continue)](#status.100){.xref} interim response if the
method, target URI, and header fields are not sufficient to cause an
immediate success, redirect, or error response. This allows the client

The field value is either an [absolute-URI](#uri.references){.xref} or a

The Referer header field allows servers to generate back-links to other
resources for simple analytics, logging, optimized caching, etc. It also
allows obsolete or mistyped links to be found for maintenance. Some
servers use the Referer header field as a means of denying links from
other sites (so-called \"deep linking\") or restricting cross-site
request forgery (CSRF), but not all requests contain
it.[¶](#section-10.1.3-4){.pilcrow}

If the target URI was obtained from a source that does not have its own
URI (e.g., input from the user keyboard, or an entry within the user\'s
bookmarks/favorites), the user agent [MUST]{.bcp14} either exclude the
Referer header field or send it with a value of
\"about:blank\".[¶](#section-10.1.3-7){.pilcrow}

The Referer header field value need not convey the full URI of the
referring resource; a user agent [MAY]{.bcp14} truncate parts other than
the referring origin.[¶](#section-10.1.3-8){.pilcrow}

The Referer header field has the potential to reveal information about
the request context or browsing history of the user, which is a privacy
concern if the referring resource\'s identifier reveals personal
information (such as an account name) or a resource that is supposed to
be confidential (such as behind a firewall or internal to a secured
service). Most general-purpose user agents do not send the Referer
header field when the referring resource is a local \"file\" or \"data\"
URI. A user agent [SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} send a
[Referer](#field.referer){.xref} header field if the referring resource
was accessed with a secure protocol and the request target has an origin
differing from that of the referring resource, unless the referring
resource explicitly allows Referer to be sent. A user agent [MUST
NOT]{.bcp14} send a [Referer](#field.referer){.xref} header field in an
unsecured HTTP request if the referring resource was accessed with a
secure protocol. See [Section
17.9](#sensitive.information.in.uris){.xref} for additional security
considerations.[¶](#section-10.1.3-9){.pilcrow}

Some intermediaries have been known to indiscriminately remove Referer
header fields from outgoing requests. This has the unfortunate side
effect of interfering with protection against CSRF attacks, which can be
far more harmful to their users. Intermediaries and user agent
extensions that wish to limit information disclosure in Referer ought to
restrict their changes to specific edits, such as replacing internal
domain names with pseudonyms or truncating the query and/or path
components. An intermediary [SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} modify or delete the

There are circumstances in which a fragment identifier in a Location

in a [201 (Created)](#status.201){.xref} response is supposed to provide
a URI that is specific to the created
resource.[¶](#section-10.2.2-12){.pilcrow}

**Note:** Some recipients attempt to recover from Location header fields
that are not valid URI references. This specification does not mandate
or define such processing, but does allow it for the sake of robustness.
A Location field value cannot allow a list of members because the comma
list separator is a valid data character within a URI-reference. If an
invalid message is sent with multiple Location field lines, a recipient
along the path might combine those field lines into one value. Recovery
of a valid Location field value from that situation is difficult and not
interoperable across implementations.[¶](#section-10.2.2-13.1){.pilcrow}

**Note:** The [Content-Location](#field.content-location){.xref} header
field ([Section 8.7](#field.content-location){.xref}) differs from
Location in that the Content-Location refers to the most specific

HTTP provides a general framework for access control and authentication,
via an extensible set of challenge-response authentication schemes,
which can be used by a server to challenge a client request and by a
client to provide authentication information. It uses a case-insensitive
token to identify the authentication
scheme:[¶](#section-11.1-1){.pilcrow}

:::

Aside from the general framework, this document does not specify any
authentication schemes. New and existing authentication schemes are
specified independently and ought to be registered within the
\"Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Authentication Scheme Registry\".
For example, the \"basic\" and \"digest\" authentication schemes are
defined by \[[RFC7617](#RFC7617){.xref}\] and
\[[RFC7616](#RFC7616){.xref}\],
respectively.[¶](#section-11.1-3){.pilcrow}

The authentication scheme is followed by additional information
necessary for achieving authentication via that scheme as either a
comma-separated list of parameters or a single sequence of characters
capable of holding base64-encoded
information.[¶](#section-11.2-1){.pilcrow}

The token68 syntax allows the 66 unreserved URI characters
(\[[URI](#URI){.xref}\]), plus a few others, so that it can hold a

(hex) encoding, with or without padding, but excluding whitespace
(\[[RFC4648](#RFC4648){.xref}\]).[¶](#section-11.2-3){.pilcrow}

Authentication parameters are name/value pairs, where the name token is
matched case-insensitively and each parameter name [MUST]{.bcp14} only
occur once per challenge.[¶](#section-11.2-4){.pilcrow}

Parameter values can be expressed either as \"token\" or as

Authentication scheme definitions need to accept both notations, both
for senders and recipients, to allow recipients to use generic parsing
components regardless of the authentication
scheme.[¶](#section-11.2-6){.pilcrow}

For backwards compatibility, authentication scheme definitions can
restrict the format for senders to one of the two variants. This can be
important when it is known that deployed implementations will fail when
encountering one of the two formats.[¶](#section-11.2-7){.pilcrow}

contain the client\'s credentials for the realm of the resource being

ought to do so by selecting the challenge with what it considers to be
the most secure auth-scheme that it understands, obtaining credentials
from the user as appropriate. Transmission of credentials within header
field values implies significant security considerations regarding the
confidentiality of the underlying connection, as described in [Section

Upon receipt of a request for a protected resource that omits

The \"realm\" authentication parameter is reserved for use by
authentication schemes that wish to indicate a scope of
protection.[¶](#section-11.5-1){.pilcrow}

A \"protection space\" is defined by the origin (see [Section
4.3.1](#origin){.xref}) of the server being accessed, in combination
with the realm value if present. These realms allow the protected
resources on a server to be partitioned into a set of protection spaces,
each with its own authentication scheme and/or authorization database.
The realm value is a string, generally assigned by the origin server,
that can have additional semantics specific to the authentication
scheme. Note that a response can have multiple challenges with the same
auth-scheme but with different realms.[¶](#section-11.5-2){.pilcrow}

The protection space determines the domain over which credentials can be
automatically applied. If a prior request has been authorized, the user
agent [MAY]{.bcp14} reuse the same credentials for all other requests
within that protection space for a period of time determined by the
authentication scheme, parameters, and/or user preferences (such as a
configurable inactivity timeout).[¶](#section-11.5-3){.pilcrow}

The extent of a protection space, and therefore the requests to which
credentials might be automatically applied, is not necessarily known to
clients without additional information. An authentication scheme might
define parameters that describe the extent of a protection space. Unless
specifically allowed by the authentication scheme, a single protection
space cannot extend outside the scope of its
server.[¶](#section-11.5-4){.pilcrow}

For historical reasons, a sender [MUST]{.bcp14} only generate the
quoted-string syntax. Recipients might have to support both token and
quoted-string syntax for maximum interoperability with existing clients
that have been accepting both notations for a long
time.[¶](#section-11.5-5){.pilcrow}

## [12.](#section-12){.section-number .selfRef} [Content Negotiation](#name-content-negotiation){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-content-negotiation}

When responses convey content, whether indicating a success or an error,
the origin server often has different ways of representing that
information; for example, in different formats, languages, or encodings.
Likewise, different users or user agents might have differing
capabilities, characteristics, or preferences that could influence which
representation, among those available, would be best to deliver. For
this reason, HTTP provides mechanisms for [content
negotiation](#content.negotiation){.xref}.[¶](#section-12-1){.pilcrow}

This specification defines three patterns of content negotiation that
can be made visible within the protocol: \"proactive\" negotiation,
where the server selects the representation based upon the user agent\'s
stated preferences; \"reactive\" negotiation, where the server provides
a list of representations for the user agent to choose from; and
\"request content\" negotiation, where the user agent selects the
representation for a future request based upon the server\'s stated
preferences in past responses.[¶](#section-12-2){.pilcrow}

Other patterns of content negotiation include \"conditional content\",
where the representation consists of multiple parts that are selectively
rendered based on user agent parameters, \"active content\", where the
representation contains a script that makes additional (more specific)
requests based on the user agent characteristics, and \"Transparent
Content Negotiation\" (\[[RFC2295](#RFC2295){.xref}\]), where content
selection is performed by an intermediary. These patterns are not
mutually exclusive, and each has trade-offs in applicability and
practicality.[¶](#section-12-3){.pilcrow}

Note that, in all cases, HTTP is not aware of the resource semantics.
The consistency with which an origin server responds to requests, over
time and over the varying dimensions of content negotiation, and thus
the \"sameness\" of a resource\'s observed representations over time, is
determined entirely by whatever entity or algorithm selects or generates
those responses.[¶](#section-12-4){.pilcrow}

### [12.1.](#section-12.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Proactive Negotiation](#name-proactive-negotiation){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-proactive-negotiation}

When content negotiation preferences are sent by the user agent in a
request to encourage an algorithm located at the server to select the
preferred representation, it is called \"proactive negotiation\"
(a.k.a., \"server-driven negotiation\"). Selection is based on the
available representations for a response (the dimensions over which it
might vary, such as language, content coding, etc.) compared to various
information supplied in the request, including both the explicit
negotiation header fields below and implicit characteristics, such as
the client\'s network address or parts of the
[User-Agent](#field.user-agent){.xref}
field.[¶](#section-12.1-1){.pilcrow}

Proactive negotiation is advantageous when the algorithm for selecting
from among the available representations is difficult to describe to a
user agent, or when the server desires to send its \"best guess\" to the
user agent along with the first response (when that \"best guess\" is
good enough for the user, this avoids the round-trip delay of a
subsequent request). In order to improve the server\'s guess, a user
agent [MAY]{.bcp14} send request header fields that describe its
preferences.[¶](#section-12.1-2){.pilcrow}

Proactive negotiation has serious
disadvantages:[¶](#section-12.1-3){.pilcrow}

-   [It is impossible for the server to accurately determine what might
    be \"best\" for any given user, since that would require complete
    knowledge of both the capabilities of the user agent and the
    intended use for the response (e.g., does the user want to view it
    on screen or print it on
    paper?);[¶](#section-12.1-4.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-12.1-4.1}

A user agent cannot rely on proactive negotiation preferences being
consistently honored, since the origin server might not implement
proactive negotiation for the requested resource or might decide that
sending a response that doesn\'t conform to the user agent\'s
preferences is better than sending a [406 (Not
Acceptable)](#status.406){.xref} response.[¶](#section-12.1-5){.pilcrow}

A [Vary](#field.vary){.xref} header field ([Section
12.5.5](#field.vary){.xref}) is often sent in a response subject to
proactive negotiation to indicate what parts of the request information
were used in the selection algorithm.[¶](#section-12.1-6){.pilcrow}

The request header fields [Accept](#field.accept){.xref},
[Accept-Charset](#field.accept-charset){.xref},
[Accept-Encoding](#field.accept-encoding){.xref}, and
[Accept-Language](#field.accept-language){.xref} are defined below for a
user agent to engage in [proactive
negotiation](#proactive.negotiation){.xref} of the response content. The
preferences sent in these fields apply to any content in the response,
including representations of the target resource, representations of
error or processing status, and potentially even the miscellaneous text
strings that might appear within the
protocol.[¶](#section-12.1-7){.pilcrow}

### [12.2.](#section-12.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Reactive Negotiation](#name-reactive-negotiation){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-reactive-negotiation}

With \"reactive negotiation\" (a.k.a., \"agent-driven negotiation\"),
selection of content (regardless of the status code) is performed by the
user agent after receiving an initial response. The mechanism for
reactive negotiation might be as simple as a list of references to
alternative representations.[¶](#section-12.2-1){.pilcrow}

If the user agent is not satisfied by the initial response content, it
can perform a GET request on one or more of the alternative resources to
obtain a different representation. Selection of such alternatives might
be performed automatically (by the user agent) or manually (e.g., by the
user selecting from a hypertext menu).[¶](#section-12.2-2){.pilcrow}

A server might choose not to send an initial representation, other than
the list of alternatives, and thereby indicate that reactive negotiation
by the user agent is preferred. For example, the alternatives listed in
responses with the [300 (Multiple Choices)](#status.300){.xref} and [406
(Not Acceptable)](#status.406){.xref} status codes include information
about available representations so that the user or user agent can react
by making a selection.[¶](#section-12.2-3){.pilcrow}

Reactive negotiation is advantageous when the response would vary over
commonly used dimensions (such as type, language, or encoding), when the
origin server is unable to determine a user agent\'s capabilities from
examining the request, and generally when public caches are used to
distribute server load and reduce network
usage.[¶](#section-12.2-4){.pilcrow}

Reactive negotiation suffers from the disadvantages of transmitting a
list of alternatives to the user agent, which degrades user-perceived
latency if transmitted in the header section, and needing a second
request to obtain an alternate representation. Furthermore, this
specification does not define a mechanism for supporting automatic
selection, though it does not prevent such a mechanism from being
developed.[¶](#section-12.2-5){.pilcrow}

When content negotiation preferences are sent in a server\'s response,
the listed preferences are called \"request content negotiation\"
because they intend to influence selection of an appropriate content for
subsequent requests to that resource. For example, the
[Accept](#field.accept){.xref} ([Section 12.5.1](#field.accept){.xref})

12.5.3](#field.accept-encoding){.xref}) header fields can be sent in a

subsequent requests to that resource.[¶](#section-12.3-1){.pilcrow}

Similarly, [Section
3.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5789#section-3.1){.relref} of
\[[RFC5789](#RFC5789){.xref}\] defines the \"Accept-Patch\" response

For each of the content negotiation fields, a request that does not
contain the field implies that the sender has no preference on that
dimension of negotiation.[¶](#section-12.4.1-1){.pilcrow}

If a content negotiation header field is present in a request and none
of the available representations for the response can be considered
acceptable according to it, the origin server can either honor the
header field by sending a [406 (Not Acceptable)](#status.406){.xref}
response or disregard the header field by treating the response as if it
is not subject to content negotiation for that request header field.
This does not imply, however, that the client will be able to use the
representation.[¶](#section-12.4.1-2){.pilcrow}

**Note:** A user agent sending these header fields makes it easier for a
server to identify an individual by virtue of the user agent\'s request
characteristics ([Section

The content negotiation fields defined by this specification use a
common parameter, named \"q\" (case-insensitive), to assign a relative
\"weight\" to the preference for that associated kind of content. This
weight is referred to as a \"quality value\" (or \"qvalue\") because the
same parameter name is often used within server configurations to assign
a weight to the relative quality of the various representations that can
be selected for a resource.[¶](#section-12.4.2-1){.pilcrow}

The weight is normalized to a real number in the range 0 through 1,
where 0.001 is the least preferred and 1 is the most preferred; a value
of 0 means \"not acceptable\". If no \"q\" parameter is present, the
default weight is 1.[¶](#section-12.4.2-2){.pilcrow}

unacceptable. Within [Vary](#field.vary){.xref}, the wildcard value

**Note:** In practice, using wildcards in content negotiation has
limited practical value because it is seldom useful to say, for example,
\"I prefer image/\* more or less than (some other specific value)\". By
sending Accept: \*/\*;q=0, clients can explicitly request a [406 (Not
Acceptable)](#status.406){.xref} response if a more preferred format is
not available, but they still need to be able to handle a different
response since the server is allowed to ignore their

The asterisk \"\*\" character is used to group media types into ranges,
with \"\*/\*\" indicating all media types and \"type/\*\" indicating all
subtypes of that type. The media-range can include media type parameters
that are applicable to that range.[¶](#section-12.5.1-4){.pilcrow}

Each media-range might be followed by optional applicable media type
parameters (e.g., [charset](#charset){.xref}), followed by an optional
\"q\" parameter for indicating a relative weight ([Section
12.4.2](#quality.values){.xref}).[¶](#section-12.5.1-5){.pilcrow}

Previous specifications allowed additional extension parameters to
appear after the weight parameter. The accept extension grammar
(accept-params, accept-ext) has been removed because it had a
complicated definition, was not being used in practice, and is more
easily deployed through new header fields. Senders using weights
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} send \"q\" last (after all media-range parameters).
Recipients [SHOULD]{.bcp14} process any parameter named \"q\" as weight,
regardless of parameter ordering.[¶](#section-12.5.1-6){.pilcrow}

**Note:** Use of the \"q\" parameter name to control content negotiation
would interfere with any media type parameter having the same name.
Hence, the media type registry disallows parameters named
\"q\".[¶](#section-12.5.1-7.1){.pilcrow}

    more specific entry for
    \"identity\".[¶](#section-12.5.3-10.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-12.5.3-10.2}
3.  [If the representation\'s content coding is one of the content
    codings listed in the Accept-Encoding field value, then it is
    acceptable unless it is accompanied by a qvalue of 0. (As defined in
    [Section 12.4.2](#quality.values){.xref}, a qvalue of 0 means \"not
    acceptable\".)[¶](#section-12.5.3-10.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-12.5.3-10.3}

A representation could be encoded with multiple content codings.
However, most content codings are alternative ways to accomplish the
same purpose (e.g., data compression). When selecting between multiple
content codings that have the same purpose, the acceptable content
coding with the highest non-zero qvalue is
preferred.[¶](#section-12.5.3-11){.pilcrow}

An Accept-Encoding header field with a field value that is empty implies
that the user agent does not want any content coding in response. If a
non-empty Accept-Encoding header field is present in a request and none
of the available representations for the response have a content coding
that is listed as acceptable, the origin server [SHOULD]{.bcp14} send a
response without any content coding unless the identity coding is
indicated as unacceptable.[¶](#section-12.5.3-12){.pilcrow}

When the Accept-Encoding header field is present in a response, it
indicates what content codings the resource was willing to accept in the
associated request. The field value is evaluated the same way as in a
request.[¶](#section-12.5.3-13){.pilcrow}

Note that this information is specific to the associated request; the
set of supported encodings might be different for other resources on the
same server and could change over time or depend on other aspects of the
request (such as the request method).[¶](#section-12.5.3-14){.pilcrow}

Servers that fail a request due to an unsupported content coding ought
to respond with a [415 (Unsupported Media Type)](#status.415){.xref}
status and include an Accept-Encoding header field in that response,
allowing clients to distinguish between issues related to content
codings and media types. In order to avoid confusion with issues related
to media types, servers that fail a request with a 415 status for
reasons unrelated to content codings [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} include the
Accept-Encoding header field.[¶](#section-12.5.3-15){.pilcrow}

The most common use of Accept-Encoding is in responses with a [415
(Unsupported Media Type)](#status.415){.xref} status code, in response
to optimistic use of a content coding by clients. However, the header
field can also be used to indicate to clients that content codings are
supported in order to optimize future interactions. For example, a
resource might include it in a [2xx (Successful)](#status.2xx){.xref}

compression coding but the client failed do
so.[¶](#section-12.5.3-16){.pilcrow}

It might be contrary to the privacy expectations of the user to send an
Accept-Language header field with the complete linguistic preferences of
the user in every request ([Section
17.13](#fingerprinting){.xref}).[¶](#section-12.5.4-8){.pilcrow}

Since intelligibility is highly dependent on the individual user, user
agents need to allow user control over the linguistic preference (either
through configuration of the user agent itself or by defaulting to a
user controllable system setting). A user agent that does not provide
such control to the user [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} send an Accept-Language
header field.[¶](#section-12.5.4-9){.pilcrow}

**Note:** User agents ought to provide guidance to users when setting a
preference, since users are rarely familiar with the details of language
matching as described above. For example, users might assume that on
selecting \"en-gb\", they will be served any kind of English document if
British English is not available. A user agent might suggest, in such a
case, to add \"en\" to the list for better matching
behavior.[¶](#section-12.5.4-10.1){.pilcrow}

A list containing the member \"\*\" signals that other aspects of the

A Vary field containing a list of field names has two

1.  ::: {#section-12.5.5-9.1}
    To inform cache recipients that they [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} use this

    ([Section

    \[[CACHING](#CACHING){.xref}\]) or reuse of the response has been
    validated by the origin server. In other words, Vary expands the
    cache key required to match a new request to the stored cache
    entry.[¶](#section-12.5.5-9.1.1){.pilcrow}
    :::

2.  ::: {#section-12.5.5-9.2}
    To inform user agent recipients that this response was subject to
    content negotiation ([Section 12](#content.negotiation){.xref}) and
    a different representation might be sent in a subsequent request if
    other values are provided in the listed header fields ([proactive
    negotiation](#proactive.negotiation){.xref}).[¶](#section-12.5.5-9.2.1){.pilcrow}
    :::

An origin server [SHOULD]{.bcp14} generate a Vary header field on a
cacheable response when it wishes that response to be selectively reused
for subsequent requests. Generally, that is the case when the response
content has been tailored to better fit the preferences expressed by
those selecting header fields, such as when an origin server has
selected the response\'s language based on the request\'s
[Accept-Language](#field.accept-language){.xref} header
field.[¶](#section-12.5.5-10){.pilcrow}

Vary might be elided when an origin server considers variance in content
selection to be less significant than Vary\'s performance impact on
caching, particularly when reuse is already limited by cache response
directives ([Section
5.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111#section-5.2){.relref} of
\[[CACHING](#CACHING){.xref}\]).[¶](#section-12.5.5-11){.pilcrow}

There is no need to send the Authorization field name in Vary because
reuse of that response for a different user is prohibited by the field
definition ([Section 11.6.2](#field.authorization){.xref}). Likewise, if
the response content has been selected or influenced by network region,
but the origin server wants the cached response to be reused even if
recipients move from one region to another, then there is no need for
the origin server to indicate such variance in
Vary.[¶](#section-12.5.5-12){.pilcrow}

A conditional request is an HTTP request with one or more request header
fields that indicate a precondition to be tested before applying the
request method to the target resource. [Section
13.2](#evaluation){.xref} defines when to evaluate preconditions and
their order of precedence when more than one precondition is
present.[¶](#section-13-1){.pilcrow}

Conditional GET requests are the most efficient mechanism for HTTP cache
updates \[[CACHING](#CACHING){.xref}\]. Conditionals can also be applied
to state-changing methods, such as PUT and DELETE, to prevent the \"lost
update\" problem: one client accidentally overwriting the work of
another client that has been acting in
parallel.[¶](#section-13-2){.pilcrow}

### [13.1.](#section-13.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Preconditions](#name-preconditions){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-preconditions}

[]{#iref-selected-representation-335 .iref}

Preconditions are usually defined with respect to a state of the target
resource as a whole (its current value set) or the state as observed in
a previously obtained representation (one value in that set). If a
resource has multiple current representations, each with its own
observable state, a precondition will assume that the mapping of each
request to a [selected representation](#selected.representation){.xref}
([Section 3.2](#representations){.xref}) is consistent over time.
Regardless, if the mapping is inconsistent or the server is unable to
select an appropriate representation, then no harm will result when the
precondition evaluates to false.[¶](#section-13.1-1){.pilcrow}

Each precondition defined below consists of a comparison between a set
of validators obtained from prior representations of the target resource
to the current state of validators for the selected representation
([Section 8.8](#response.validator){.xref}). Hence, these preconditions
evaluate whether the state of the target resource has changed since a
given state known by the client. The effect of such an evaluation
depends on the method semantics and choice of conditional, as defined in
[Section 13.2](#evaluation){.xref}.[¶](#section-13.1-2){.pilcrow}

Other preconditions, defined by other specifications as extension
fields, might place conditions on all recipients, on the state of the
target resource in general, or on a group of resources. For instance,
the \"If\" header field in WebDAV can make a request conditional on
various aspects of multiple resources, such as locks, if the recipient
understands and implements that field (\[[WEBDAV](#WEBDAV){.xref}\],
[Section
10.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4918#section-10.4){.relref}).[¶](#section-13.1-3){.pilcrow}

Extensibility of preconditions is only possible when the precondition
can be safely ignored if unknown (like
[If-Modified-Since](#field.if-modified-since){.xref}), when deployment
can be assumed for a given use case, or when implementation is signaled
by some other property of the target resource. This encourages a focus
on mutually agreed deployment of common
standards.[¶](#section-13.1-4){.pilcrow}

The \"If-Match\" header field makes the request method conditional on

or having a current representation of the target resource that has an
entity tag matching a member of the list of entity tags provided in the

An origin server [MUST]{.bcp14} use the strong comparison function when
comparing entity tags for If-Match ([Section

precondition to prevent the method from being applied if there have been

[¶](#section-13.1.1-5){.pilcrow}
:::

If-Match is most often used with state-changing methods (e.g., POST,
PUT, DELETE) to prevent accidental overwrites when multiple user agents
might be acting in parallel on the same resource (i.e., to prevent the
\"lost update\" problem). In general, it can be used with any method
that involves the selection or modification of a representation to abort
the request if the [selected
representation](#selected.representation){.xref}\'s current entity tag
is not a member within the If-Match field
value.[¶](#section-13.1.1-6){.pilcrow}

When an origin server receives a request that selects a representation
and that request includes an If-Match header field, the origin server
[MUST]{.bcp14} evaluate the If-Match condition per [Section
13.2](#evaluation){.xref} prior to performing the
method.[¶](#section-13.1.1-7){.pilcrow}

To evaluate a received If-Match header
field:[¶](#section-13.1.1-8){.pilcrow}

1.  [If the field value is \"\*\", the condition is true if the origin
    server has a current representation for the target
    resource.[¶](#section-13.1.1-9.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-13.1.1-9.1}
2.  [If the field value is a list of entity tags, the condition is true
    if any of the listed tags match the entity tag of the selected
    representation.[¶](#section-13.1.1-9.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-13.1.1-9.2}
3.  [Otherwise, the condition is
    false.[¶](#section-13.1.1-9.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-13.1.1-9.3}

An origin server that evaluates an If-Match condition [MUST NOT]{.bcp14}
perform the requested method if the condition evaluates to false.
Instead, the origin server [MAY]{.bcp14} indicate that the conditional
request failed by responding with a [412 (Precondition
Failed)](#status.412){.xref} status code. Alternatively, if the request
is a state-changing operation that appears to have already been applied
to the selected representation, the origin server [MAY]{.bcp14} respond
with a [2xx (Successful)](#status.2xx){.xref} status code (i.e., the
change requested by the user agent has already succeeded, but the user
agent might not be aware of it, perhaps because the prior response was
lost or an equivalent change was made by some other user
agent).[¶](#section-13.1.1-10){.pilcrow}

Allowing an origin server to send a success response when a change
request appears to have already been applied is more efficient for many
authoring use cases, but comes with some risk if multiple user agents
are making change requests that are very similar but not cooperative.
For example, multiple user agents writing to a common resource as a
semaphore (e.g., a nonatomic increment) are likely to collide and
potentially lose important state transitions. For those kinds of
resources, an origin server is better off being stringent in sending 412
for every failed precondition on an unsafe method. In other cases,
excluding the ETag field from a success response might encourage the
user agent to perform a GET as its next request to eliminate confusion
about the resource\'s current state.[¶](#section-13.1.1-11){.pilcrow}

A client [MAY]{.bcp14} send an If-Match header field in a
[GET](#GET){.xref} request to indicate that it would prefer a [412
(Precondition Failed)](#status.412){.xref} response if the selected
representation does not match. However, this is only useful in range
requests ([Section 14](#range.requests){.xref}) for completing a
previously received partial representation when there is no desire for a
new representation. [If-Range](#field.if-range){.xref} ([Section
13.1.5](#field.if-range){.xref}) is better suited for range requests
when the client prefers to receive a new
representation.[¶](#section-13.1.1-12){.pilcrow}

A cache or intermediary [MAY]{.bcp14} ignore If-Match because its
interoperability features are only necessary for an origin
server.[¶](#section-13.1.1-13){.pilcrow}

Note that an If-Match header field with a list value containing \"\*\"

invalid (therefore not allowed to be generated) and furthermore is
unlikely to be interoperable.[¶](#section-13.1.1-14){.pilcrow}

[¶](#section-13.1.2-5){.pilcrow}

If-None-Match is primarily used in conditional GET requests to enable
efficient updates of cached information with a minimum amount of
transaction overhead. When a client desires to update one or more stored
responses that have entity tags, the client [SHOULD]{.bcp14} generate an
If-None-Match header field containing a list of those entity tags when
making a GET request; this allows recipient servers to send a [304 (Not
Modified)](#status.304){.xref} response to indicate when one of those
stored responses matches the selected
representation.[¶](#section-13.1.2-6){.pilcrow}

If-None-Match can also be used with a value of \"\*\" to prevent an
unsafe request method (e.g., PUT) from inadvertently modifying an
existing representation of the target resource when the client believes
that the resource does not have a current representation ([Section
9.2.1](#safe.methods){.xref}). This is a variation on the \"lost
update\" problem that might arise if more than one client attempts to
create an initial representation for the target
resource.[¶](#section-13.1.2-7){.pilcrow}

When used for cache updates, a cache will typically use the value of the
cached message\'s [Last-Modified](#field.last-modified){.xref} header
field to generate the field value of If-Modified-Since. This behavior is
most interoperable for cases where clocks are poorly synchronized or
when the server has chosen to only honor exact timestamp matches (due to
a problem with Last-Modified dates that appear to go \"back in time\"
when the origin server\'s clock is corrected or a representation is
restored from an archived backup). However, caches occasionally generate
the field value based on other data, such as the
[Date](#field.date){.xref} header field of the cached message or the
clock time at which the message was received, particularly when the
cached message does not contain a
[Last-Modified](#field.last-modified){.xref} header
field.[¶](#section-13.1.3-10){.pilcrow}

When used for limiting the scope of retrieval to a recent time window, a
user agent will generate an If-Modified-Since field value based on
either its own clock or a [Date](#field.date){.xref} header field
received from the server in a prior response. Origin servers that choose
an exact timestamp match based on the selected representation\'s
[Last-Modified](#field.last-modified){.xref} header field will not be

changed during the specified window.[¶](#section-13.1.3-11){.pilcrow}

:::

A recipient [MUST]{.bcp14} ignore If-Unmodified-Since if the request
contains an [If-Match](#field.if-match){.xref} header field; the
condition in [If-Match](#field.if-match){.xref} is considered to be a
more accurate replacement for the condition in If-Unmodified-Since, and
the two are only combined for the sake of interoperating with older
intermediaries that might not implement
[If-Match](#field.if-match){.xref}.[¶](#section-13.1.4-5){.pilcrow}

A recipient [MUST]{.bcp14} ignore the If-Unmodified-Since header field
if the received field value is not a valid HTTP-date (including when the
field value appears to be a list of
dates).[¶](#section-13.1.4-6){.pilcrow}

A recipient [MUST]{.bcp14} ignore the If-Unmodified-Since header field
if the resource does not have a modification date
available.[¶](#section-13.1.4-7){.pilcrow}

A recipient [MUST]{.bcp14} interpret an If-Unmodified-Since field
value\'s timestamp in terms of the origin server\'s
clock.[¶](#section-13.1.4-8){.pilcrow}

If-Unmodified-Since is most often used with state-changing methods
(e.g., POST, PUT, DELETE) to prevent accidental overwrites when multiple
user agents might be acting in parallel on a resource that does not
supply entity tags with its representations (i.e., to prevent the \"lost
update\" problem). In general, it can be used with any method that
involves the selection or modification of a representation to abort the
request if the [selected
representation](#selected.representation){.xref}\'s last modification
date has changed since the date provided in the If-Unmodified-Since
field value.[¶](#section-13.1.4-9){.pilcrow}

When an origin server receives a request that selects a representation
and that request includes an If-Unmodified-Since header field without an
[If-Match](#field.if-match){.xref} header field, the origin server
[MUST]{.bcp14} evaluate the If-Unmodified-Since condition per [Section
13.2](#evaluation){.xref} prior to performing the
method.[¶](#section-13.1.4-10){.pilcrow}

To evaluate a received If-Unmodified-Since header
field:[¶](#section-13.1.4-11){.pilcrow}

1.  [If the selected representation\'s last modification date is earlier
    than or equal to the date provided in the field value, the condition
    is true.[¶](#section-13.1.4-12.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-13.1.4-12.1}
2.  [Otherwise, the condition is
    false.[¶](#section-13.1.4-12.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-13.1.4-12.2}

An origin server that evaluates an If-Unmodified-Since condition [MUST
NOT]{.bcp14} perform the requested method if the condition evaluates to
false. Instead, the origin server [MAY]{.bcp14} indicate that the
conditional request failed by responding with a [412 (Precondition
Failed)](#status.412){.xref} status code. Alternatively, if the request
is a state-changing operation that appears to have already been applied
to the selected representation, the origin server [MAY]{.bcp14} respond
with a [2xx (Successful)](#status.2xx){.xref} status code (i.e., the
change requested by the user agent has already succeeded, but the user
agent might not be aware of it, perhaps because the prior response was
lost or an equivalent change was made by some other user
agent).[¶](#section-13.1.4-13){.pilcrow}

Allowing an origin server to send a success response when a change
request appears to have already been applied is more efficient for many
authoring use cases, but comes with some risk if multiple user agents
are making change requests that are very similar but not cooperative. In
those cases, an origin server is better off being stringent in sending
412 for every failed precondition on an unsafe
method.[¶](#section-13.1.4-14){.pilcrow}

A client [MAY]{.bcp14} send an If-Unmodified-Since header field in a
[GET](#GET){.xref} request to indicate that it would prefer a [412
(Precondition Failed)](#status.412){.xref} response if the selected
representation has been modified. However, this is only useful in range
requests ([Section 14](#range.requests){.xref}) for completing a
previously received partial representation when there is no desire for a
new representation. [If-Range](#field.if-range){.xref} ([Section
13.1.5](#field.if-range){.xref}) is better suited for range requests
when the client prefers to receive a new
representation.[¶](#section-13.1.4-15){.pilcrow}

A cache or intermediary [MAY]{.bcp14} ignore If-Unmodified-Since because
its interoperability features are only necessary for an origin
server.[¶](#section-13.1.4-16){.pilcrow}

The \"If-Range\" header field provides a special conditional request
mechanism that is similar to the [If-Match](#field.if-match){.xref} and
[If-Unmodified-Since](#field.if-unmodified-since){.xref} header fields
but that instructs the recipient to ignore the
[Range](#field.range){.xref} header field if the validator doesn\'t
match, resulting in transfer of the new [selected
representation](#selected.representation){.xref} instead of a [412
(Precondition Failed)](#status.412){.xref}
response.[¶](#section-13.1.5-1){.pilcrow}

If a client has a partial copy of a representation and wishes to have an
up-to-date copy of the entire representation, it could use the
[Range](#field.range){.xref} header field with a conditional GET (using
either or both of
[If-Unmodified-Since](#field.if-unmodified-since){.xref} and
[If-Match](#field.if-match){.xref}.) However, if the precondition fails
because the representation has been modified, the client would then have
to make a second request to obtain the entire current
representation.[¶](#section-13.1.5-2){.pilcrow}

The \"If-Range\" header field allows a client to \"short-circuit\" the
second request. Informally, its meaning is as follows: if the
representation is unchanged, send me the part(s) that I am requesting in
Range; otherwise, send me the entire
representation.[¶](#section-13.1.5-3){.pilcrow}

Except when excluded below, a recipient cache or origin server
[MUST]{.bcp14} evaluate received request preconditions after it has
successfully performed its normal request checks and just before it
would process the request content (if any) or perform the action
associated with the request method. A server [MUST]{.bcp14} ignore all
received preconditions if its response to the same request without those
conditions, prior to processing the request content, would have been a
status code other than a [2xx (Successful)](#status.2xx){.xref} or [412
(Precondition Failed)](#status.412){.xref}. In other words, redirects
and failures that can be detected before significant processing occurs
take precedence over the evaluation of
preconditions.[¶](#section-13.2.1-1){.pilcrow}

A server that is not the origin server for the target resource and
cannot act as a cache for requests on the target resource [MUST
NOT]{.bcp14} evaluate the conditional request header fields defined by
this specification, and it [MUST]{.bcp14} forward them if the request is
forwarded, since the generating client intends that they be evaluated by
a server that can provide a current representation. Likewise, a server
[MUST]{.bcp14} ignore the conditional request header fields defined by
this specification when received with a request method that does not
involve the selection or modification of a [selected
representation](#selected.representation){.xref}, such as CONNECT,
OPTIONS, or TRACE.[¶](#section-13.2.1-2){.pilcrow}

Note that protocol extensions can modify the conditions under which
preconditions are evaluated or the consequences of their evaluation. For
example, the immutable cache directive (defined by
\[[RFC8246](#RFC8246){.xref}\]) instructs caches to forgo forwarding
conditional requests when they hold a fresh
response.[¶](#section-13.2.1-3){.pilcrow}

Although conditional request header fields are defined as being usable
with the HEAD method (to keep HEAD\'s semantics consistent with those of
GET), there is no point in sending a conditional HEAD because a
successful response is around the same size as a [304 (Not
Modified)](#status.304){.xref} response and more useful than a [412
(Precondition Failed)](#status.412){.xref}
response.[¶](#section-13.2.1-4){.pilcrow}

When more than one conditional request header field is present in a
request, the order in which the fields are evaluated becomes important.
In practice, the fields defined in this document are consistently
implemented in a single, logical order, since \"lost update\"
preconditions have more strict requirements than cache validation, a
validated cache is more efficient than a partial response, and entity
tags are presumed to be more accurate than date
validators.[¶](#section-13.2.2-1){.pilcrow}

Clients often encounter interrupted data transfers as a result of
canceled requests or dropped connections. When a client has stored a
partial representation, it is desirable to request the remainder of that
representation in a subsequent request rather than transfer the entire
representation. Likewise, devices with limited local storage might
benefit from being able to request only a subset of a larger
representation, such as a single page of a very large document, or the
dimensions of an embedded image.[¶](#section-14-1){.pilcrow}

Range requests are an [OPTIONAL]{.bcp14} feature of HTTP, designed so
that recipients not implementing this feature (or not supporting it for
the target resource) can respond as if it is a normal GET request
without impacting interoperability. Partial responses are indicated by a
distinct status code to not be mistaken for full responses by caches
that might not implement the feature.[¶](#section-14-2){.pilcrow}

Representation data can be partitioned into subranges when there are
addressable structural units inherent to that data\'s content coding or

The \"bytes\" range unit is used to express subranges of a
representation data\'s octet sequence. Each byte range is expressed as
an integer range at some offset, relative to either the beginning
([int-range](#rule.int-range){.xref}) or end
([suffix-range](#rule.suffix-range){.xref}) of the representation data.
Byte ranges do not use the [other-range](#rule.other-range){.xref}
specifier.[¶](#section-14.1.2-1){.pilcrow}

The [first-pos](#rule.int-range){.xref} value in a bytes
[int-range](#rule.int-range){.xref} gives the offset of the first byte
in a range. The [last-pos](#rule.int-range){.xref} value gives the
offset of the last byte in the range; that is, the byte positions
specified are inclusive. Byte offsets start at
zero.[¶](#section-14.1.2-2){.pilcrow}

If the representation data has a content coding applied, each byte range
is calculated with respect to the encoded sequence of bytes, not the
sequence of underlying bytes that would be obtained after
decoding.[¶](#section-14.1.2-3){.pilcrow}

A client can limit the number of bytes requested without knowing the
size of the [selected representation](#selected.representation){.xref}.
If the [last-pos](#rule.int-range){.xref} value is absent, or if the
value is greater than or equal to the current length of the
representation data, the byte range is interpreted as the remainder of
the representation (i.e., the server replaces the value of
[last-pos](#rule.int-range){.xref} with a value that is one less than
the current length of the selected
representation).[¶](#section-14.1.2-6){.pilcrow}

request multiple ranges that are inherently less efficient to process

A server that supports range requests [MAY]{.bcp14} ignore a
[Range](#field.range){.xref} header field when the selected
representation has no content (i.e., the selected representation\'s data
is of zero length).[¶](#section-14.2-7){.pilcrow}

A client that is requesting multiple ranges [SHOULD]{.bcp14} list those
ranges in ascending order (the order in which they would typically be
received in a complete representation) unless there is a specific need
to request a later part earlier. For example, a user agent processing a

request later parts first, particularly if the representation consists
of pages stored in reverse order and the user agent wishes to transfer
one page at a time.[¶](#section-14.2-8){.pilcrow}

The Range header field is evaluated after evaluating the precondition
header fields defined in [Section 13.1](#preconditions){.xref}, and only

[]{#iref-media-type-multipart-bytera .iref}
[]{#iref-multipart-byteranges-media- .iref}

When a [206 (Partial Content)](#status.206){.xref} response message
includes the content of multiple ranges, they are transmitted as body
parts in a multipart message body (\[[RFC2046](#RFC2046){.xref}\],
[Section
5.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2046#section-5.1){.relref}) with
the media type of
\"multipart/byteranges\".[¶](#section-14.6-1){.pilcrow}

The \"multipart/byteranges\" media type includes one or more body parts,
each with its own [Content-Type](#field.content-type){.xref} and
[Content-Range](#field.content-range){.xref} fields. The required
boundary parameter specifies the boundary string used to separate each
body part.[¶](#section-14.6-2){.pilcrow}

Implementation Notes:[¶](#section-14.6-3){.pilcrow}

1.  [Additional CRLFs might precede the first boundary string in the
    body.[¶](#section-14.6-4.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-14.6-4.1}
2.  [Although \[[RFC2046](#RFC2046){.xref}\] permits the boundary string
    to be quoted, some existing implementations handle a quoted boundary
    string
    incorrectly.[¶](#section-14.6-4.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-14.6-4.2}
3.  [A number of clients and servers were coded to an early draft of the
    byteranges specification that used a media type of
    \"multipart/x-byteranges\"[]{#iref-multipart-x-byteranges-medi
    .iref}[]{#iref-media-type-multipart-x-byte .iref}, which is almost
    (but not quite) compatible with this
    type.[¶](#section-14.6-4.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-14.6-4.3}

Despite the name, the \"multipart/byteranges\" media type is not limited
to byte ranges. The following example uses an \"exampleunit\" range
unit:[¶](#section-14.6-5){.pilcrow}

## [15.](#section-15){.section-number .selfRef} [Status Codes](#name-status-codes){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-status-codes}

[]{#iref-status-code-394 .iref}

The status code of a response is a three-digit integer code that
describes the result of the request and the semantics of the response,
including whether the request was successful and what content is
enclosed (if any). All valid status codes are within the range of 100 to
599, inclusive.[¶](#section-15-1){.pilcrow}

The first digit of the status code defines the class of response. The
last two digits do not have any categorization role. There are five
values for the first digit:[¶](#section-15-2){.pilcrow}

-   [[1xx (Informational)](#status.1xx){.xref}: The request was
    received, continuing
    process[¶](#section-15-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-15-3.1}
-   [[2xx (Successful)](#status.2xx){.xref}: The request was
    successfully received, understood, and
    accepted[¶](#section-15-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-15-3.2}
-   [[3xx (Redirection)](#status.3xx){.xref}: Further action needs to be
    taken in order to complete the
    request[¶](#section-15-3.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-15-3.3}
-   [[4xx (Client Error)](#status.4xx){.xref}: The request contains bad
    syntax or cannot be
    fulfilled[¶](#section-15-3.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-15-3.4}
-   [[5xx (Server Error)](#status.5xx){.xref}: The server failed to
    fulfill an apparently valid
    request[¶](#section-15-3.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-15-3.5}

HTTP status codes are extensible. A client is not required to understand
the meaning of all registered status codes, though such understanding is
obviously desirable. However, a client [MUST]{.bcp14} understand the
class of any status code, as indicated by the first digit, and treat an
unrecognized status code as being equivalent to the x00 status code of
that class.[¶](#section-15-4){.pilcrow}

For example, if a client receives an unrecognized status code of 471, it
can see from the first digit that there was something wrong with its
request and treat the response as if it had received a [400 (Bad
Request)](#status.400){.xref} status code. The response message will
usually contain a representation that explains the
status.[¶](#section-15-5){.pilcrow}

Values outside the range 100..599 are invalid. Implementations often use
three-digit integer values outside of that range (i.e., 600..999) for
internal communication of non-HTTP status (e.g., library errors). A
client that receives a response with an invalid status code
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} process the response as if it had a [5xx (Server
Error)](#status.5xx){.xref} status code.[¶](#section-15-6){.pilcrow}

[]{#iref-status-codes-final-395 .iref} []{#iref-status-codes-interim-396
.iref} []{#iref-status-codes-informational- .iref} A single request can
have multiple associated responses: zero or more \"interim\" (non-final)
responses with status codes in the \"informational\"
([1xx](#status.1xx){.xref}) range, followed by exactly one \"final\"
response with a status code in one of the other
ranges.[¶](#section-15-7){.pilcrow}

The status codes listed below are defined in this specification. The
reason phrases listed here are only recommendations \-- they can be
replaced by local equivalents or left out altogether without affecting
the protocol.[¶](#section-15.1-1){.pilcrow}

Responses with status codes that are defined as heuristically cacheable
(e.g., 200, 203, 204, 206, 300, 301, 308, 404, 405, 410, 414, and 501 in
this specification) can be reused by a cache with heuristic expiration
unless otherwise indicated by the method definition or explicit cache
controls \[[CACHING](#CACHING){.xref}\]; all other status codes are not
heuristically cacheable.[¶](#section-15.1-2){.pilcrow}

Additional status codes, outside the scope of this specification, have
been specified for use in HTTP. All such status codes ought to be
registered within the \"Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Status Code
Registry\", as described in [Section
16.2](#status.code.extensibility){.xref}.[¶](#section-15.1-3){.pilcrow}

[]{#iref-1xx-informational-status-co .iref}
[]{#iref-status-codes-classes-1xx-in .iref}

The 1xx (Informational) class of status code indicates an interim
response for communicating connection status or request progress prior
to completing the requested action and sending a final response. Since
HTTP/1.0 did not define any 1xx status codes, a server [MUST
NOT]{.bcp14} send a 1xx response to an HTTP/1.0
client.[¶](#section-15.2-1){.pilcrow}

A 1xx response is terminated by the end of the header section; it cannot
contain content or trailers.[¶](#section-15.2-2){.pilcrow}

A client [MUST]{.bcp14} be able to parse one or more 1xx responses
received prior to a final response, even if the client does not expect
one. A user agent [MAY]{.bcp14} ignore unexpected 1xx
responses.[¶](#section-15.2-3){.pilcrow}

A proxy [MUST]{.bcp14} forward 1xx responses unless the proxy itself
requested the generation of the 1xx response. For example, if a proxy
adds an \"Expect: 100-continue\" header field when it forwards a
request, then it need not forward the corresponding [100
(Continue)](#status.100){.xref}
response(s).[¶](#section-15.2-4){.pilcrow}

[]{#iref-100-continue-status-code-40 .iref}

The 100 (Continue) status code indicates that the initial part of a
request has been received and has not yet been rejected by the server.
The server intends to send a final response after the request has been
fully received and acted upon.[¶](#section-15.2.1-1){.pilcrow}

When the request contains an [Expect](#field.expect){.xref} header field
that includes a [100-continue](#field.expect){.xref} expectation, the
100 response indicates that the server wishes to receive the request
content, as described in [Section 10.1.1](#field.expect){.xref}. The
client ought to continue sending the request and discard the 100
response.[¶](#section-15.2.1-2){.pilcrow}

If the request did not contain an [Expect](#field.expect){.xref} header
field containing the [100-continue](#field.expect){.xref} expectation,
the client can simply discard this interim
response.[¶](#section-15.2.1-3){.pilcrow}

[]{#iref-101-switching-protocols-sta .iref}

The 101 (Switching Protocols) status code indicates that the server
understands and is willing to comply with the client\'s request, via the
[Upgrade](#field.upgrade){.xref} header field ([Section
7.8](#field.upgrade){.xref}), for a change in the application protocol
being used on this connection. The server [MUST]{.bcp14} generate an
Upgrade header field in the response that indicates which protocol(s)
will be in effect after this response.[¶](#section-15.2.2-1){.pilcrow}

It is assumed that the server will only agree to switch protocols when
it is advantageous to do so. For example, switching to a newer version
of HTTP might be advantageous over older versions, and switching to a
real-time, synchronous protocol might be advantageous when delivering
resources that use such features.[¶](#section-15.2.2-2){.pilcrow}

[]{#iref-200-ok-status-code-404 .iref}

The 200 (OK) status code indicates that the request has succeeded. The
content sent in a 200 response depends on the request method. For the
methods defined by this specification, the intended meaning of the
content can be summarized as:[¶](#section-15.3.1-1){.pilcrow}

  Request Method   Response content is a representation of:
  ---------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  GET              the [target resource](#target.resource){.xref}
  HEAD             the [target resource](#target.resource){.xref}, like GET, but without transferring the representation data
  POST             the status of, or results obtained from, the action
  PUT, DELETE      the status of the action
  OPTIONS          communication options for the target resource
  TRACE            the request message as received by the server returning the trace

  : [Table 6](#table-6){.selfRef}

Aside from responses to CONNECT, a 200 response is expected to contain
message content unless the message framing explicitly indicates that the
content has zero length. If some aspect of the request indicates a
preference for no content upon success, the origin server ought to send
a 204 (No Content) response instead. For CONNECT, there is no content
because the successful result is a tunnel, which begins immediately
after the 200 response header section.[¶](#section-15.3.1-3){.pilcrow}

A 200 response is heuristically cacheable; i.e., unless otherwise
indicated by the method definition or explicit cache controls (see
[Section
4.2.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111#section-4.2.2){.relref} of
\[[CACHING](#CACHING){.xref}\]).[¶](#section-15.3.1-4){.pilcrow}

In 200 responses to GET or HEAD, an origin server [SHOULD]{.bcp14} send
any available validator fields ([Section
8.8](#response.validator){.xref}) for the [selected
representation](#selected.representation){.xref}, with both a strong
entity tag and a [Last-Modified](#field.last-modified){.xref} date being
preferred.[¶](#section-15.3.1-5){.pilcrow}

In 200 responses to state-changing methods, any validator fields
([Section 8.8](#response.validator){.xref}) sent in the response convey
the current validators for the new representation formed as a result of
successfully applying the request semantics. Note that the PUT method
([Section 9.3.4](#PUT){.xref}) has additional requirements that might
preclude sending such validators.[¶](#section-15.3.1-6){.pilcrow}

[]{#iref-201-created-status-code-405 .iref}

The 201 (Created) status code indicates that the request has been
fulfilled and has resulted in one or more new resources being created.
The primary resource created by the request is identified by either a
[Location](#field.location){.xref} header field in the response or, if
no [Location](#field.location){.xref} header field is received, by the
target URI.[¶](#section-15.3.2-1){.pilcrow}

The 201 response content typically describes and links to the
resource(s) created. Any validator fields ([Section
8.8](#response.validator){.xref}) sent in the response convey the
current validators for a new representation created by the request. Note
that the PUT method ([Section 9.3.4](#PUT){.xref}) has additional
requirements that might preclude sending such
validators.[¶](#section-15.3.2-2){.pilcrow}

[]{#iref-202-accepted-status-code-40 .iref}

The 202 (Accepted) status code indicates that the request has been
accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed. The
request might or might not eventually be acted upon, as it might be
disallowed when processing actually takes place. There is no facility in
HTTP for re-sending a status code from an asynchronous
operation.[¶](#section-15.3.3-1){.pilcrow}

The 202 response is intentionally noncommittal. Its purpose is to allow
a server to accept a request for some other process (perhaps a
batch-oriented process that is only run once per day) without requiring
that the user agent\'s connection to the server persist until the
process is completed. The representation sent with this response ought
to describe the request\'s current status and point to (or embed) a
status monitor that can provide the user with an estimate of when the
request will be fulfilled.[¶](#section-15.3.3-2){.pilcrow}

[]{#iref-203-non-authoritative-infor .iref}

The 203 (Non-Authoritative Information) status code indicates that the
request was successful but the enclosed content has been modified from
that of the origin server\'s [200 (OK)](#status.200){.xref} response by
a transforming proxy ([Section 7.7](#message.transformations){.xref}).
This status code allows the proxy to notify recipients when a
transformation has been applied, since that knowledge might impact later
decisions regarding the content. For example, future cache validation
requests for the content might only be applicable along the same request
path (through the same proxies).[¶](#section-15.3.4-1){.pilcrow}

A 203 response is heuristically cacheable; i.e., unless otherwise
indicated by the method definition or explicit cache controls (see
[Section

[]{#iref-204-no-content-status-code- .iref}

The 204 (No Content) status code indicates that the server has
successfully fulfilled the request and that there is no additional
content to send in the response content. Metadata in the response header
fields refer to the [target resource](#target.resource){.xref} and its
[selected representation](#selected.representation){.xref} after the
requested action was applied.[¶](#section-15.3.5-1){.pilcrow}

For example, if a 204 status code is received in response to a PUT
request and the response contains an [ETag](#field.etag){.xref} field,
then the PUT was successful and the ETag field value contains the entity
tag for the new representation of that target
resource.[¶](#section-15.3.5-2){.pilcrow}

The 204 response allows a server to indicate that the action has been
successfully applied to the target resource, while implying that the
user agent does not need to traverse away from its current \"document
view\" (if any). The server assumes that the user agent will provide
some indication of the success to its user, in accord with its own
interface, and apply any new or updated metadata in the response to its
active representation.[¶](#section-15.3.5-3){.pilcrow}

For example, a 204 status code is commonly used with document editing
interfaces corresponding to a \"save\" action, such that the document
being saved remains available to the user for editing. It is also
frequently used with interfaces that expect automated data transfers to
be prevalent, such as within distributed version control
systems.[¶](#section-15.3.5-4){.pilcrow}

A 204 response is terminated by the end of the header section; it cannot
contain content or trailers.[¶](#section-15.3.5-5){.pilcrow}

fulfilled the request and desires that the user agent reset the
\"document view\", which caused the request to be sent, to its original
state as received from the origin
server.[¶](#section-15.3.6-1){.pilcrow}

This response is intended to support a common data entry use case where
the user receives content that supports data entry (a form, notepad,
canvas, etc.), enters or manipulates data in that space, causes the
entered data to be submitted in a request, and then the data entry
mechanism is reset for the next entry so that the user can easily
initiate another input action.[¶](#section-15.3.6-2){.pilcrow}

successfully fulfilling a range request for the target resource by
transferring one or more parts of the [selected
representation](#selected.representation){.xref}.[¶](#section-15.3.7-1){.pilcrow}

A server that supports range requests ([Section
14](#range.requests){.xref}) will usually attempt to satisfy all of the
requested ranges, since sending less data will likely result in another
client request for the remainder. However, a server might want to send
only a subset of the data requested for reasons of its own, such as
temporary unavailability, cache efficiency, load balancing, etc. Since a
206 response is self-descriptive, the client can still understand a
response that only partially satisfies its range
request.[¶](#section-15.3.7-2){.pilcrow}

A client [MUST]{.bcp14} inspect a 206 response\'s
[Content-Type](#field.content-type){.xref} and

parts are enclosed and whether additional requests are

A [Content-Length](#field.content-length){.xref} header field present in
a 206 response indicates the number of octets in the content of this

representation. Each [Content-Range](#field.content-range){.xref} header
field includes information about the selected representation\'s complete
length.[¶](#section-15.3.7-5){.pilcrow}

A sender that generates a 206 response to a request with an
[If-Range](#field.if-range){.xref} header field [SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14}
generate other representation header fields beyond those required
because the client already has a prior response containing those header
fields. Otherwise, a sender [MUST]{.bcp14} generate all of the
representation header fields that would have been sent in a [200

When multiple ranges are requested, a server [MAY]{.bcp14} coalesce any
of the ranges that overlap, or that are separated by a gap that is
smaller than the overhead of sending multiple parts, regardless of the
order in which the corresponding range-spec appeared in the received
[Range](#field.range){.xref} header field. Since the typical overhead
between each part of a \"multipart/byteranges\" is around 80 bytes,
depending on the selected representation\'s media type and the chosen
boundary parameter length, it can be less efficient to transfer many
small disjoint parts than it is to transfer the entire selected
representation.[¶](#section-15.3.7.2-4){.pilcrow}

A server [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} generate a multipart response to a request
for a single range, since a client that does not request multiple parts
might not support multipart responses. However, a server [MAY]{.bcp14}
generate a \"multipart/byteranges\" response with only a single body
part if multiple ranges were requested and only one range was found to
be satisfiable or only one range remained after coalescing. A client
that cannot process a \"multipart/byteranges\" response [MUST
NOT]{.bcp14} generate a request that asks for multiple
ranges.[¶](#section-15.3.7.2-5){.pilcrow}

A server that generates a multipart response [SHOULD]{.bcp14} send the
parts in the same order that the corresponding range-spec appeared in
the received [Range](#field.range){.xref} header field, excluding those
ranges that were deemed unsatisfiable or that were coalesced into other
ranges. A client that receives a multipart response [MUST]{.bcp14}
inspect the [Content-Range](#field.content-range){.xref} header field
present in each body part in order to determine which range is contained

A response might transfer only a subrange of a representation if the
connection closed prematurely or if the request used one or more Range
specifications. After several such transfers, a client might have
received several ranges of the same representation. These ranges can
only be safely combined if they all have in common the same strong

The 3xx (Redirection) class of status code indicates that further action

There are several types of redirects:[¶](#section-15.4-1){.pilcrow}

1.  [Redirects that indicate this resource might be available at a
    different URI, as provided by the [Location](#field.location){.xref}

    an indirect response to the request, as in the [303 (See

**Note:** In HTTP/1.0, the status codes [301 (Moved
Permanently)](#status.301){.xref} and [302 (Found)](#status.302){.xref}
were originally defined as method-preserving
(\[[HTTP/1.0](#HTTP10){.xref}\], [Section
9.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1945#section-9.3){.relref}) to
match their implementation at CERN; [303 (See
Other)](#status.303){.xref} was defined for a redirection that changed
its method to GET. However, early user agents split on whether to
redirect POST requests as POST (according to then-current specification)
or as GET (the safer alternative when redirected to a different site).
Prevailing practice eventually converged on changing the method to GET.
[307 (Temporary Redirect)](#status.307){.xref} and [308 (Permanent
Redirect)](#status.308){.xref} \[[RFC7538](#RFC7538){.xref}\] were later
added to unambiguously indicate method-preserving redirects, and status
codes [301](#status.301){.xref} and [302](#status.302){.xref} have been
adjusted to allow a POST request to be redirected as
GET.[¶](#section-15.4-3.1){.pilcrow}

If a [Location](#field.location){.xref} header field ([Section
10.2.2](#field.location){.xref}) is provided, the user agent
[MAY]{.bcp14} automatically redirect its request to the URI referenced
by the Location field value, even if the specific status code is not
understood. Automatic redirection needs to be done with care for methods
not known to be [safe](#safe.methods){.xref}, as defined in [Section
9.2.1](#safe.methods){.xref}, since the user might not wish to redirect
an unsafe request.[¶](#section-15.4-4){.pilcrow}

[SHOULD]{.bcp14} resend the original request message with the following
modifications:[¶](#section-15.4-5){.pilcrow}

The 300 (Multiple Choices) status code indicates that the [target
resource](#target.resource){.xref} has more than one representation,
each with its own more specific identifier, and information about the
alternatives is being provided so that the user (or user agent) can
select a preferred representation by redirecting its request to one or
more of those identifiers. In other words, the server desires that the
user agent engage in reactive negotiation to select the most appropriate
representation(s) for its needs ([Section
12](#content.negotiation){.xref}).[¶](#section-15.4.1-1){.pilcrow}

If the server has a preferred choice, the server [SHOULD]{.bcp14}
generate a [Location](#field.location){.xref} header field containing a
preferred choice\'s URI reference. The user agent [MAY]{.bcp14} use the
Location field value for automatic
redirection.[¶](#section-15.4.1-2){.pilcrow}

For request methods other than HEAD, the server [SHOULD]{.bcp14}
generate content in the 300 response containing a list of representation
metadata and URI reference(s) from which the user or user agent can
choose the one most preferred. The user agent [MAY]{.bcp14} make a
selection from that list automatically if it understands the provided
media type. A specific format for automatic selection is not defined by
this specification because HTTP tries to remain orthogonal to the
definition of its content. In practice, the representation is provided
in some easily parsed format believed to be acceptable to the user
agent, as determined by shared design or content negotiation, or in some
commonly accepted hypertext format.[¶](#section-15.4.1-3){.pilcrow}

A 300 response is heuristically cacheable; i.e., unless otherwise

**Note:** The original proposal for the 300 status code defined the URI
header field as providing a list of alternative representations, such
that it would be usable for 200, 300, and 406 responses and be
transferred in responses to the HEAD method. However, lack of deployment
and disagreement over syntax led to both URI and Alternates (a
subsequent proposal) being dropped from this specification. It is
possible to communicate the list as a Link header field value

\"alternate\", though deployment is a chicken-and-egg

enclosed URIs. The server is suggesting that a user agent with
link-editing capability can permanently replace references to the target
URI with one of the new references sent by the server. However, this
suggestion is usually ignored unless the user agent is actively editing
references (e.g., engaged in authoring content), the connection is
secured, and the origin server is a trusted authority for the content
being edited.[¶](#section-15.4.2-1){.pilcrow}

The server [SHOULD]{.bcp14} generate a

perform a retrieval request targeting that URI (a GET or HEAD request if

result as an answer to the original request. Note that the new URI in
the Location header field is not considered equivalent to the target
URI.[¶](#section-15.4.4-1){.pilcrow}

This status code is applicable to any HTTP method. It is primarily used
to allow the output of a POST action to redirect the user agent to a
different resource, since doing so provides the information
corresponding to the POST response as a resource that can be separately
identified, bookmarked, and cached.[¶](#section-15.4.4-2){.pilcrow}

A 303 response to a GET request indicates that the origin server does
not have a representation of the [target

refers to a resource that is descriptive of the target resource, such

representation that is useful to recipients without implying that it

HTTP.[¶](#section-15.4.4-3){.pilcrow}

The 308 (Permanent Redirect) status code indicates that the [target

and any future references to this resource ought to use one of the
enclosed URIs. The server is suggesting that a user agent with
link-editing capability can permanently replace references to the target

suggestion is usually ignored unless the user agent is actively editing
references (e.g., engaged in authoring content), the connection is

being edited.[¶](#section-15.4.9-1){.pilcrow}

The server [SHOULD]{.bcp14} generate a

The 410 response is primarily intended to assist the task of web

## [16.](#section-16){.section-number .selfRef} [Extending HTTP](#name-extending-http){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-extending-http}

HTTP defines a number of generic extension points that can be used to
introduce capabilities to the protocol without introducing a new
version, including methods, status codes, field names, and further
extensibility points within defined fields, such as authentication
schemes and cache directives (see Cache-Control extensions in [Section
5.2.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111#section-5.2.3){.relref} of
\[[CACHING](#CACHING){.xref}\]). Because the semantics of HTTP are not
versioned, these extension points are persistent; the version of the
protocol in use does not affect their
semantics.[¶](#section-16-1){.pilcrow}

Version-independent extensions are discouraged from depending on or
interacting with the specific version of the protocol in use. When this
is unavoidable, careful consideration needs to be given to how the
extension can interoperate across versions.[¶](#section-16-2){.pilcrow}

Additionally, specific versions of HTTP might have their own
extensibility points, such as transfer codings in HTTP/1.1 ([Section
6.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9112#section-6.1){.relref} of
\[[HTTP/1.1](#HTTP11){.xref}\]) and HTTP/2 SETTINGS or frame types
(\[[HTTP/2](#HTTP2){.xref}\]). These extension points are specific to
the version of the protocol they occur
within.[¶](#section-16-3){.pilcrow}

Version-specific extensions cannot override or modify the semantics of a
version-independent mechanism or extension point (like a method or
header field) without explicitly being allowed by that protocol element.
For example, the CONNECT method ([Section 9.3.6](#CONNECT){.xref})
allows this.[¶](#section-16-4){.pilcrow}

These guidelines assure that the protocol operates correctly and
predictably, even when parts of the path implement different versions of
HTTP.[¶](#section-16-5){.pilcrow}

Standardized methods are generic; that is, they are potentially
applicable to any resource, not just one particular media type, kind of
resource, or application. As such, it is preferred that new methods be
registered in a document that isn\'t specific to a single application or
data format, since orthogonal technologies deserve orthogonal
specification.[¶](#section-16.1.2-1){.pilcrow}

Since message parsing ([Section 6](#message.abstraction){.xref}) needs
to be independent of method semantics (aside from responses to HEAD),
definitions of new methods cannot change the parsing algorithm or
prohibit the presence of content on either the request or the response
message. Definitions of new methods can specify that only a zero-length
content is allowed by requiring a Content-Length header field with a
value of \"0\".[¶](#section-16.1.2-2){.pilcrow}

Likewise, new methods cannot use the special host:port and asterisk
forms of request target that are allowed for [CONNECT](#CONNECT){.xref}
and [OPTIONS](#OPTIONS){.xref}, respectively ([Section
7.1](#target.resource){.xref}). A full URI in absolute form is needed
for the target URI, which means either the request target needs to be
sent in absolute form or the target URI will be reconstructed from the
request context in the same way it is for other
methods.[¶](#section-16.1.2-3){.pilcrow}

A new method definition needs to indicate whether it is safe ([Section
9.2.1](#safe.methods){.xref}), idempotent ([Section
9.2.2](#idempotent.methods){.xref}), cacheable ([Section
9.2.3](#cacheable.methods){.xref}), what semantics are to be associated
with the request content (if any), and what refinements the method makes
to header field or status code semantics. If the new method is
cacheable, its definition ought to describe how, and under what
conditions, a cache can store a response and use it to satisfy a
subsequent request. The new method ought to describe whether it can be
made conditional ([Section 13.1](#preconditions){.xref}) and, if so, how
a server responds when the condition is false. Likewise, if the new
method might have some use for partial response semantics ([Section
14.2](#field.range){.xref}), it ought to document this,
too.[¶](#section-16.1.2-4){.pilcrow}

**Note:** Avoid defining a method name that starts with \"M-\", since

it by \[[RFC2774](#RFC2774){.xref}\].[¶](#section-16.1.2-5.1){.pilcrow}

When it is necessary to express semantics for a response that are not
defined by current status codes, a new status code can be registered.
Status codes are generic; they are potentially applicable to any
resource, not just one particular media type, kind of resource, or
application of HTTP. As such, it is preferred that new status codes be
registered in a document that isn\'t specific to a single
application.[¶](#section-16.2.2-1){.pilcrow}

New status codes are required to fall under one of the categories
defined in [Section 15](#status.codes){.xref}. To allow existing parsers
to process the response message, new status codes cannot disallow
content, although they can mandate a zero-length
content.[¶](#section-16.2.2-2){.pilcrow}

Proposals for new status codes that are not yet widely deployed ought to
avoid allocating a specific number for the code until there is clear
consensus that it will be registered; instead, early drafts can use a
notation such as \"4NN\", or \"3N0\" .. \"3N9\", to indicate the class
of the proposed status code(s) without consuming a number
prematurely.[¶](#section-16.2.2-3){.pilcrow}

The definition of a new status code ought to explain the request
conditions that would cause a response containing that status code
(e.g., combinations of request header fields and/or method(s)) along
with any dependencies on response header fields (e.g., what fields are
required, what fields can modify the semantics, and what field semantics
are further refined when used with the new status
code).[¶](#section-16.2.2-4){.pilcrow}

By default, a status code applies only to the request corresponding to
the response it occurs within. If a status code applies to a larger
scope of applicability \-- for example, all requests to the resource in
question or all requests to a server \-- this must be explicitly
specified. When doing so, it should be noted that not all clients can be
expected to consistently apply a larger scope because they might not
understand the new status code.[¶](#section-16.2.2-5){.pilcrow}

The definition of a new final status code ought to specify whether or
not it is heuristically cacheable. Note that any response with a final
status code can be cached if the response has explicit freshness
information. A status code defined as heuristically cacheable is allowed
to be cached without explicit freshness information. Likewise, the
definition of a status code can place constraints upon cache behavior if
the must-understand cache directive is used. See
\[[CACHING](#CACHING){.xref}\] for more
information.[¶](#section-16.2.2-6){.pilcrow}

Finally, the definition of a new status code ought to indicate whether
the content has any implied association with an identified resource
([Section
6.4.2](#identifying.content){.xref}).[¶](#section-16.2.2-7){.pilcrow}

HTTP\'s most widely used extensibility point is the definition of new
header and trailer fields.[¶](#section-16.3-1){.pilcrow}

New fields can be defined such that, when they are understood by a
recipient, they override or enhance the interpretation of previously

However, defining a field doesn\'t guarantee its deployment or
recognition by recipients. Most fields are designed with the expectation
that a recipient can safely ignore (but forward downstream) any field
not recognized. In other cases, the sender\'s ability to understand a
given field might be indicated by its prior communication, perhaps in
the protocol version or fields that it sent in prior messages, or its
use of a specific media type. Likewise, direct inspection of support
might be possible through an OPTIONS request or by interacting with a
defined well-known URI \[[RFC8615](#RFC8615){.xref}\] if such inspection
is defined along with the field being

intended for wider use need to be carefully documented to ensure
interoperability.[¶](#section-16.3.2-1){.pilcrow}

In particular, authors of specifications defining new fields are advised
to consider and, where appropriate, document the following
aspects:[¶](#section-16.3.2-2){.pilcrow}

-   [Under what conditions the field can be used; e.g., only in
    responses or requests, in all messages, only on responses to a
    particular request method,
    etc.[¶](#section-16.3.2-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-16.3.2-3.1}
-   [Whether the field semantics are further refined by their context,
    such as their use with certain request methods or status
    codes.[¶](#section-16.3.2-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-16.3.2-3.2}
-   [The scope of applicability for the information conveyed. By
    default, fields apply only to the message they are associated with,
    but some response fields are designed to apply to all
    representations of a resource, the resource itself, or an even
    broader scope. Specifications that expand the scope of a response
    field will need to carefully consider issues such as content
    negotiation, the time period of applicability, and (in some cases)
    multi-tenant server
    deployments.[¶](#section-16.3.2-3.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-16.3.2-3.3}
-   [Under what conditions intermediaries are allowed to insert, delete,
    or modify the field\'s
    value.[¶](#section-16.3.2-3.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-16.3.2-3.4}
-   [If the field is allowable in trailers; by default, it will not be
    (see [Section
    6.5.1](#trailers.limitations){.xref}).[¶](#section-16.3.2-3.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-16.3.2-3.5}
-   [Whether it is appropriate or even required to list the field name
    in the [Connection](#field.connection){.xref} header field (i.e., if
    the field is to be hop-by-hop; see [Section
    7.6.1](#field.connection){.xref}).[¶](#section-16.3.2-3.6){.pilcrow}]{#section-16.3.2-3.6}
-   [Whether the field introduces any additional security
    considerations, such as disclosure of privacy-related
    data.[¶](#section-16.3.2-3.7){.pilcrow}]{#section-16.3.2-3.7}

Request header fields have additional considerations that need to be
documented if the default behavior is not
appropriate:[¶](#section-16.3.2-4){.pilcrow}

-   [If it is appropriate to list the field name in a
    [Vary](#field.vary){.xref} response header field (e.g., when the
    request header field is used by an origin server\'s content
    selection algorithm; see [Section

    request (see [Section
    9.3.4](#PUT){.xref}).[¶](#section-16.3.2-5.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-16.3.2-5.2}
-   [If the field ought to be removed when automatically redirecting a
    request due to security concerns (see [Section

Authors of specifications defining new fields are advised to choose a
short but descriptive field name. Short names avoid needless data
transmission; descriptive names avoid confusion and \"squatting\" on
names that might have broader uses.[¶](#section-16.3.2.1-1){.pilcrow}

To that end, limited-use fields (such as a header confined to a single
application or use case) are encouraged to use a name that includes that
use (or an abbreviation) as a prefix; for example, if the Foo
Application needs a Description field, it might use \"Foo-Desc\";
\"Description\" is too generic, and \"Foo-Description\" is needlessly
long.[¶](#section-16.3.2.1-2){.pilcrow}

While the field-name syntax is defined to allow any token character, in
practice some implementations place limits on the characters they accept
in field-names. To be interoperable, new field names [SHOULD]{.bcp14}
constrain themselves to alphanumeric characters, \"-\", and \".\", and
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} begin with a letter. For example, the underscore
(\"\_\") character can be problematic when passed through non-HTTP
gateway interfaces (see [Section
17.10](#underscore.in.fields){.xref}).[¶](#section-16.3.2.1-3){.pilcrow}

Field names ought not be prefixed with \"X-\"; see
\[[BCP178](#BCP178){.xref}\] for further
information.[¶](#section-16.3.2.1-4){.pilcrow}

Other prefixes are sometimes used in HTTP field names; for example,
\"Accept-\" is used in many content negotiation headers, and
\"Content-\" is used as explained in [Section 6.4](#content){.xref}.
These prefixes are only an aid to recognizing the purpose of a field and
do not trigger automatic processing.[¶](#section-16.3.2.1-5){.pilcrow}

A major task in the definition of a new HTTP field is the specification
of the field value syntax: what senders should generate, and how
recipients should infer semantics from what is
received.[¶](#section-16.3.2.2-1){.pilcrow}

Authors are encouraged (but not required) to use either the ABNF rules
in this specification or those in \[[RFC8941](#RFC8941){.xref}\] to
define the syntax of new field values.[¶](#section-16.3.2.2-2){.pilcrow}

Authors are advised to carefully consider how the combination of
multiple field lines will impact them (see [Section
5.3](#fields.order){.xref}). Because senders might erroneously send
multiple values, and both intermediaries and HTTP libraries can perform
combination automatically, this applies to all field values \-- even
when only a single value is
anticipated.[¶](#section-16.3.2.2-3){.pilcrow}

Therefore, authors are advised to delimit or encode values that contain
commas (e.g., with the [quoted-string](#rule.quoted-string){.xref} rule
of [Section 5.6.4](#quoted.strings){.xref}, the String data type of
\[[RFC8941](#RFC8941){.xref}\], or a field-specific encoding). This
ensures that commas within field data are not confused with the commas
that delimit a list value.[¶](#section-16.3.2.2-4){.pilcrow}

For example, the [Content-Type](#field.content-type){.xref} field value
only allows commas inside quoted strings, which can be reliably parsed
even when multiple values are present. The
[Location](#field.location){.xref} field value provides a
counter-example that should not be emulated: because URIs can include
commas, it is not possible to reliably distinguish between a single
value that includes a comma from two
values.[¶](#section-16.3.2.2-5){.pilcrow}

Authors of fields with a singleton value (see [Section
5.5](#fields.values){.xref}) are additionally advised to document how to
treat messages where the multiple members are present (a sensible
default would be to ignore the field, but this might not always be the
right choice).[¶](#section-16.3.2.2-6){.pilcrow}

There are certain aspects of the HTTP Authentication framework that put
constraints on how new authentication schemes can
work:[¶](#section-16.4.2-1){.pilcrow}

-   ::: {#section-16.4.2-2.1}
    HTTP authentication is presumed to be stateless: all of the
    information necessary to authenticate a request [MUST]{.bcp14} be
    provided in the request, rather than be dependent on the server
    remembering prior requests. Authentication based on, or bound to,
    the underlying connection is outside the scope of this specification
    and inherently flawed unless steps are taken to ensure that the
    connection cannot be used by any party other than the authenticated
    user (see [Section
    3.3](#connections){.xref}).[¶](#section-16.4.2-2.1.1){.pilcrow}
    :::

-   ::: {#section-16.4.2-2.2}
    The authentication parameter \"realm\" is reserved for defining
    protection spaces as described in [Section
    11.5](#protection.space){.xref}. New schemes [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} use
    it in a way incompatible with that
    definition.[¶](#section-16.4.2-2.2.1){.pilcrow}
    :::

-   ::: {#section-16.4.2-2.3}
    The \"token68\" notation was introduced for compatibility with
    existing authentication schemes and can only be used once per
    challenge or credential. Thus, new schemes ought to use the
    auth-param syntax instead, because otherwise future extensions will
    be impossible.[¶](#section-16.4.2-2.3.1){.pilcrow}
    :::

-   ::: {#section-16.4.2-2.4}
    The parsing of challenges and credentials is defined by this
    specification and cannot be modified by new authentication schemes.
    When the auth-param syntax is used, all parameters ought to support
    both token and quoted-string syntax, and syntactical constraints
    ought to be defined on the field value after parsing (i.e.,
    quoted-string processing). This is necessary so that recipients can
    use a generic parser that applies to all authentication
    schemes.[¶](#section-16.4.2-2.4.1){.pilcrow}

    **Note:** The fact that the value syntax for the \"realm\" parameter
    is restricted to quoted-string was a bad design choice not to be
    repeated for new parameters.[¶](#section-16.4.2-2.4.2){.pilcrow}
    :::

-   ::: {#section-16.4.2-2.5}
    Definitions of new schemes ought to define the treatment of unknown
    extension parameters. In general, a \"must-ignore\" rule is
    preferable to a \"must-understand\" rule, because otherwise it will
    be hard to introduce new parameters in the presence of legacy
    recipients. Furthermore, it\'s good to describe the policy for
    defining new parameters (such as \"update the specification\" or
    \"use this registry\").[¶](#section-16.4.2-2.5.1){.pilcrow}
    :::

-   ::: {#section-16.4.2-2.6}
    Authentication schemes need to document whether they are usable in
    origin-server authentication (i.e., using
    [WWW-Authenticate](#field.www-authenticate){.xref}), and/or proxy
    authentication (i.e., using
    [Proxy-Authenticate](#field.proxy-authenticate){.xref}).[¶](#section-16.4.2-2.6.1){.pilcrow}
    :::

-   ::: {#section-16.4.2-2.7}
    The credentials carried in an
    [Authorization](#field.authorization){.xref} header field are
    specific to the user agent and, therefore, have the same effect on
    HTTP caches as the \"private\" cache response directive ([Section
    5.2.2.7](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111#section-5.2.2.7){.relref}
    of \[[CACHING](#CACHING){.xref}\]), within the scope of the request
    in which they appear.[¶](#section-16.4.2-2.7.1){.pilcrow}

    Therefore, new authentication schemes that choose not to carry
    credentials in the [Authorization](#field.authorization){.xref}
    header field (e.g., using a newly defined header field) will need to
    explicitly disallow caching, by mandating the use of cache response

## [17.](#section-17){.section-number .selfRef} [Security Considerations](#name-security-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-security-considerations}

This section is meant to inform developers, information providers, and
users of known security concerns relevant to HTTP semantics and its use
for transferring information over the Internet. Considerations related
to caching are discussed in [Section
7](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111#section-7){.relref} of
\[[CACHING](#CACHING){.xref}\], and considerations related to HTTP/1.1
message syntax and parsing are discussed in [Section
11](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9112#section-11){.relref} of
\[[HTTP/1.1](#HTTP11){.xref}\].[¶](#section-17-1){.pilcrow}

The list of considerations below is not exhaustive. Most security
concerns related to HTTP semantics are about securing server-side
applications (code behind the HTTP interface), securing user agent
processing of content received via HTTP, or secure use of the Internet
in general, rather than security of the protocol. The security
considerations for URIs, which are fundamental to HTTP operation, are
discussed in [Section
7](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986#section-7){.relref} of
\[[URI](#URI){.xref}\]. Various organizations maintain topical
information and links to current research on Web application security
(e.g., \[[OWASP](#OWASP){.xref}\]).[¶](#section-17-2){.pilcrow}

::: {#establishing.authority}
::: {#section-17.1 .section}
### [17.1.](#section-17.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Establishing Authority](#name-establishing-authority){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-establishing-authority}

[]{#iref-authoritative-response-454 .iref} []{#iref-phishing-455 .iref}

HTTP relies on the notion of an \"authoritative response\": a response
that has been determined by (or at the direction of) the origin server
identified within the target URI to be the most appropriate response for
that request given the state of the target resource at the time of
response message origination.[¶](#section-17.1-1){.pilcrow}

When a registered name is used in the authority component, the \"http\"
URI scheme ([Section 4.2.1](#http.uri){.xref}) relies on the user\'s
local name resolution service to determine where it can find
authoritative responses. This means that any attack on a user\'s network
host table, cached names, or name resolution libraries becomes an avenue
for attack on establishing authority for \"http\" URIs. Likewise, the
user\'s choice of server for Domain Name Service (DNS), and the
hierarchy of servers from which it obtains resolution results, could
impact the authenticity of address mappings; DNS Security Extensions
(DNSSEC, \[[RFC4033](#RFC4033){.xref}\]) are one way to improve
authenticity, as are the various mechanisms for making DNS requests over
more secure transfer protocols.[¶](#section-17.1-2){.pilcrow}

Furthermore, after an IP address is obtained, establishing authority for
an \"http\" URI is vulnerable to attacks on Internet Protocol
routing.[¶](#section-17.1-3){.pilcrow}

The \"https\" scheme ([Section 4.2.2](#https.uri){.xref}) is intended to
prevent (or at least reveal) many of these potential attacks on
establishing authority, provided that the negotiated connection is
secured and the client properly verifies that the communicating
server\'s identity matches the target URI\'s authority component
([Section 4.3.4](#https.verify){.xref}). Correctly implementing such
verification can be difficult (see
\[[Georgiev](#Georgiev){.xref}\]).[¶](#section-17.1-4){.pilcrow}

Authority for a given origin server can be delegated through protocol
extensions; for example, \[[ALTSVC](#ALTSVC){.xref}\]. Likewise, the set
of servers for which a connection is considered authoritative can be
changed with a protocol extension like
\[[RFC8336](#RFC8336){.xref}\].[¶](#section-17.1-5){.pilcrow}

Providing a response from a non-authoritative source, such as a shared
proxy cache, is often useful to improve performance and availability,
but only to the extent that the source can be trusted or the distrusted
response can be safely used.[¶](#section-17.1-6){.pilcrow}

Unfortunately, communicating authority to users can be difficult. For
example, \"phishing\" is an attack on the user\'s perception of
authority, where that perception can be misled by presenting similar
branding in hypertext, possibly aided by userinfo obfuscating the
authority component (see [Section 4.2.1](#http.uri){.xref}). User agents
can reduce the impact of phishing attacks by enabling users to easily
inspect a target URI prior to making an action, by prominently
distinguishing (or rejecting) userinfo when present, and by not sending
stored credentials and cookies when the referring document is from an
unknown or untrusted source.[¶](#section-17.1-7){.pilcrow}

HTTP intermediaries are inherently situated for on-path attacks.
Compromise of the systems on which the intermediaries run can result in
serious security and privacy problems. Intermediaries might have access
to security-related information, personal information about individual
users and organizations, and proprietary information belonging to users
and content providers. A compromised intermediary, or an intermediary
implemented or configured without regard to security and privacy
considerations, might be used in the commission of a wide range of
potential attacks.[¶](#section-17.2-1){.pilcrow}

Intermediaries that contain a shared cache are especially vulnerable to
cache poisoning attacks, as described in [Section
7](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111#section-7){.relref} of
\[[CACHING](#CACHING){.xref}\].[¶](#section-17.2-2){.pilcrow}

Implementers need to consider the privacy and security implications of
their design and coding decisions, and of the configuration options they
provide to operators (especially the default
configuration).[¶](#section-17.2-3){.pilcrow}

under which they operate; HTTP cannot solve this

Origin servers frequently make use of their local file system to manage
the mapping from target URI to resource representations. Most file
systems are not designed to protect against malicious file or path
names. Therefore, an origin server needs to avoid accessing names that
have a special significance to the system when mapping the target
resource to files, folders, or
directories.[¶](#section-17.3-1){.pilcrow}

For example, UNIX, Microsoft Windows, and other operating systems use
\"..\" as a path component to indicate a directory level above the
current one, and they use specially named paths or file names to send
data to system devices. Similar naming conventions might exist within
other types of storage systems. Likewise, local storage systems have an
annoying tendency to prefer user-friendliness over security when
handling invalid or unexpected characters, recomposition of decomposed
characters, and case-normalization of case-insensitive
names.[¶](#section-17.3-2){.pilcrow}

Attacks based on such special names tend to focus on either
denial-of-service (e.g., telling the server to read from a COM port) or
disclosure of configuration and source files that are not meant to be
served.[¶](#section-17.3-3){.pilcrow}

Origin servers often use parameters within the URI as a means of
identifying system services, selecting database entries, or choosing a
data source. However, data received in a request cannot be trusted. An
attacker could construct any of the request data elements (method,
target URI, header fields, or content) to contain data that might be
misinterpreted as a command, code, or query when passed through a
command invocation, language interpreter, or database
interface.[¶](#section-17.4-1){.pilcrow}

For example, SQL injection is a common attack wherein additional query
language is inserted within some part of the target URI or header fields
(e.g., [Host](#field.host){.xref}, [Referer](#field.referer){.xref},
etc.). If the received data is used directly within a SELECT statement,
the query language might be interpreted as a database command instead of
a simple string value. This type of implementation vulnerability is
extremely common, in spite of being easy to
prevent.[¶](#section-17.4-2){.pilcrow}

In general, resource implementations ought to avoid use of request data
in contexts that are processed or interpreted as instructions.
Parameters ought to be compared to fixed strings and acted upon as a
result of that comparison, rather than passed through an interface that
is not prepared for untrusted data. Received data that isn\'t based on
fixed parameters ought to be carefully filtered or encoded to avoid
being misinterpreted.[¶](#section-17.4-3){.pilcrow}

processed, such as within log files, monitoring tools, or when included
within a data format that allows embedded
scripts.[¶](#section-17.4-4){.pilcrow}

Because HTTP uses mostly textual, character-delimited fields, parsers
are often vulnerable to attacks based on sending very long (or very
slow) streams of data, particularly where an implementation is expecting
a protocol element with no predefined length ([Section
2.3](#length.requirements){.xref}).[¶](#section-17.5-1){.pilcrow}

To promote interoperability, specific recommendations are made for
minimum size limits on fields ([Section 5.4](#fields.limits){.xref}).
These are minimum recommendations, chosen to be supportable even by
implementations with limited resources; it is expected that most
implementations will choose substantially higher
limits.[¶](#section-17.5-2){.pilcrow}

A server can reject a message that has a target URI that is too long
([Section 15.5.15](#status.414){.xref}) or request content that is too
large ([Section 15.5.14](#status.413){.xref}). Additional status codes
related to capacity limits have been defined by extensions to HTTP
\[[RFC6585](#RFC6585){.xref}\].[¶](#section-17.5-3){.pilcrow}

Recipients ought to carefully limit the extent to which they process
other protocol elements, including (but not limited to) request methods,
response status phrases, field names, numeric values, and chunk lengths.

Some attacks on encrypted protocols use the differences in size created
by dynamic compression to reveal confidential information; for example,
\[[BREACH](#BREACH){.xref}\]. These attacks rely on creating a
redundancy between attacker-controlled content and the confidential
information, such that a dynamic compression algorithm using the same
dictionary for both content will compress more efficiently when the
attacker-controlled content matches parts of the confidential
content.[¶](#section-17.6-1){.pilcrow}

HTTP messages can be compressed in a number of ways, including using TLS
compression, content codings, transfer codings, and other extension or
version-specific mechanisms.[¶](#section-17.6-2){.pilcrow}

The most effective mitigation for this risk is to disable compression on
sensitive data, or to strictly separate sensitive data from
attacker-controlled data so that they cannot share the same compression
dictionary. With careful design, a compression scheme can be designed in
a way that is not considered exploitable in limited use cases, such as

resources (e.g., the user\'s name, location, mail address, passwords,

A server is in the position to save personal data about a user\'s
requests over time, which might identify their reading patterns or
subjects of interest. In particular, log information gathered at an
intermediary often contains a history of user agent interaction, across
a multitude of sites, that can be traced to individual
users.[¶](#section-17.8-1){.pilcrow}

HTTP log information is confidential in nature; its handling is often
constrained by laws and regulations. Log information needs to be
securely stored and appropriate guidelines followed for its analysis.
Anonymization of personal information within individual entries helps,
but it is generally not sufficient to prevent real log traces from being
re-identified based on correlation with other access characteristics. As
such, access traces that are keyed to a specific client are unsafe to
publish even if the key is pseudonymous.[¶](#section-17.8-2){.pilcrow}

To minimize the risk of theft or accidental publication, log information
ought to be purged of personally identifiable information, including
user identifiers, IP addresses, and user-provided query parameters, as

needs for security, auditing, or fraud

### [17.9.](#section-17.9){.section-number .selfRef} [Disclosure of Sensitive Information in URIs](#name-disclosure-of-sensitive-inf){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-disclosure-of-sensitive-inf}

URIs are intended to be shared, not secured, even when they identify
secure resources. URIs are often shown on displays, added to templates
when a page is printed, and stored in a variety of unprotected bookmark
lists. Many servers, proxies, and user agents log or display the target
URI in places where it might be visible to third parties. It is
therefore unwise to include information within a URI that is sensitive,
personally identifiable, or a risk to
disclose.[¶](#section-17.9-1){.pilcrow}

When an application uses client-side mechanisms to construct a target
URI out of user-provided information, such as the query fields of a form
using GET, potentially sensitive data might be provided that would not
be appropriate for disclosure within a URI. POST is often preferred in
such cases because it usually doesn\'t construct a URI; instead, POST of
a form transmits the potentially sensitive data in the request content.
However, this hinders caching and uses an unsafe method for what would
otherwise be a safe request. Alternative workarounds include
transforming the user-provided data prior to constructing the URI or
filtering the data to only include common values that are not sensitive.
Likewise, redirecting the result of a query to a different
(server-generated) URI can remove potentially sensitive data from later
links and provide a cacheable response for later
reuse.[¶](#section-17.9-2){.pilcrow}

Since the [Referer](#field.referer){.xref} header field tells a target
site about the context that resulted in a request, it has the potential
to reveal information about the user\'s immediate browsing history and
any personal information that might be found in the referring
resource\'s URI. Limitations on the Referer header field are described
in [Section 10.1.3](#field.referer){.xref} to address some of its
security considerations.[¶](#section-17.9-3){.pilcrow}

### [17.10.](#section-17.10){.section-number .selfRef} [Application Handling of Field Names](#name-application-handling-of-fie){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-application-handling-of-fie}

Servers often use non-HTTP gateway interfaces and frameworks to process
a received request and produce content for the response. For historical
reasons, such interfaces often pass received field names as external
variable names, using a name mapping suitable for environment
variables.[¶](#section-17.10-1){.pilcrow}

For example, the Common Gateway Interface (CGI) mapping of
protocol-specific meta-variables, defined by [Section
4.1.18](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3875#section-4.1.18){.relref}
of \[[RFC3875](#RFC3875){.xref}\], is applied to received header fields
that do not correspond to one of CGI\'s standard variables; the mapping
consists of prepending \"HTTP\_\" to each name and changing all
instances of hyphen (\"-\") to underscore (\"\_\"). This same mapping
has been inherited by many other application frameworks in order to
simplify moving applications from one platform to the
next.[¶](#section-17.10-2){.pilcrow}

In CGI, a received [Content-Length](#field.content-length){.xref} field
would be passed as the meta-variable \"CONTENT_LENGTH\" with a string
value matching the received field\'s value. In contrast, a received
\"Content_Length\" header field would be passed as the protocol-specific
meta-variable \"HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH\", which might lead to some
confusion if an application mistakenly reads the protocol-specific
meta-variable instead of the default one. (This historical practice is
why [Section 16.3.2.1](#considerations.for.new.field.names){.xref}
discourages the creation of new field names that contain an
underscore.)[¶](#section-17.10-3){.pilcrow}

Unfortunately, mapping field names to different interface names can lead
to security vulnerabilities if the mapping is incomplete or ambiguous.
For example, if an attacker were to send a field named
\"Transfer_Encoding\", a naive interface might map that to the same
variable name as the \"Transfer-Encoding\" field, resulting in a
potential request smuggling vulnerability ([Section
11.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9112#section-11.2){.relref} of
\[[HTTP/1.1](#HTTP11){.xref}\]).[¶](#section-17.10-4){.pilcrow}

To mitigate the associated risks, implementations that perform such
mappings are advised to make the mapping unambiguous and complete for
the full range of potential octets received as a name (including those
that are discouraged or forbidden by the HTTP grammar). For example, a
field with an unusual name character might result in the request being
blocked, the specific field being removed, or the name being passed with
a different prefix to distinguish it from other
fields.[¶](#section-17.10-5){.pilcrow}

disclosing one site\'s fragment to another site. If the first site uses
personal information in fragments, it ought to ensure that redirects to

block that inheritance.[¶](#section-17.11-1){.pilcrow}

Browser fingerprinting is a set of techniques for identifying a specific
user agent over time through its unique set of characteristics. These
characteristics might include information related to how it uses the
underlying transport protocol, feature capabilities, and scripting
environment, though of particular interest here is the set of unique
characteristics that might be communicated via HTTP. Fingerprinting is
considered a privacy concern because it enables tracking of a user
agent\'s behavior over time (\[[Bujlow](#Bujlow){.xref}\]) without the
corresponding controls that the user might have over other forms of data
collection (e.g., cookies). Many general-purpose user agents (i.e., Web
browsers) have taken steps to reduce their
fingerprints.[¶](#section-17.13-1){.pilcrow}

There are a number of request header fields that might reveal
information to servers that is sufficiently unique to enable
fingerprinting. The [From](#field.from){.xref} header field is the most
obvious, though it is expected that From will only be sent when
self-identification is desired by the user. Likewise, Cookie header
fields are deliberately designed to enable re-identification, so
fingerprinting concerns only apply to situations where cookies are
disabled or restricted by the user agent\'s
configuration.[¶](#section-17.13-2){.pilcrow}

The [User-Agent](#field.user-agent){.xref} header field might contain
enough information to uniquely identify a specific device, usually when
combined with other characteristics, particularly if the user agent
sends excessive details about the user\'s system or extensions. However,
the source of unique information that is least expected by users is
[proactive negotiation](#proactive.negotiation){.xref} ([Section
12.1](#proactive.negotiation){.xref}), including the
[Accept](#field.accept){.xref},
[Accept-Charset](#field.accept-charset){.xref},
[Accept-Encoding](#field.accept-encoding){.xref}, and
[Accept-Language](#field.accept-language){.xref} header
fields.[¶](#section-17.13-3){.pilcrow}

In addition to the fingerprinting concern, detailed use of the
[Accept-Language](#field.accept-language){.xref} header field can reveal
information the user might consider to be of a private nature. For
example, understanding a given language set might be strongly correlated
to membership in a particular ethnic group. An approach that limits such
loss of privacy would be for a user agent to omit the sending of
Accept-Language except for sites that have been explicitly permitted,
perhaps via interaction after detecting a [Vary](#field.vary){.xref}
header field that indicates language negotiation might be
useful.[¶](#section-17.13-4){.pilcrow}

In environments where proxies are used to enhance privacy, user agents
ought to be conservative in sending proactive negotiation header fields.
General-purpose user agents that provide a high degree of header field
configurability ought to inform users about the loss of privacy that
might result if too much detail is provided. As an extreme privacy
measure, proxies could filter the proactive negotiation header fields in
relayed requests.[¶](#section-17.13-5){.pilcrow}

The validators defined by this specification are not intended to ensure

receive a response that is no more harmful than an HTTP exchange without
conditional requests.[¶](#section-17.14-1){.pilcrow}

An entity tag can be abused in ways that create privacy risks. For
example, a site might deliberately construct a semantically invalid
entity tag that is unique to the user or user agent, send it in a
cacheable response with a long freshness time, and then read that entity
tag in later conditional requests as a means of re-identifying that user
or user agent. Such an identifying tag would become a persistent
identifier for as long as the user agent retained the original cache
entry. User agents that cache representations ought to ensure that the

Various organizations maintain topical information and links to current

The HTTP authentication framework does not define a single mechanism for
maintaining the confidentiality of credentials; instead, each
authentication scheme defines how the credentials are encoded prior to
transmission. While this provides flexibility for the development of
future authentication schemes, it is inadequate for the protection of
existing schemes that provide no confidentiality on their own, or that
do not sufficiently protect against replay attacks. Furthermore, if the
server expects credentials that are specific to each individual user,
the exchange of those credentials will have the effect of identifying
that user even if the content within credentials remains
confidential.[¶](#section-17.16.1-1){.pilcrow}

HTTP depends on the security properties of the underlying transport- or
session-level connection to provide confidential transmission of fields.

Existing HTTP clients and user agents typically retain authentication
information indefinitely. HTTP does not provide a mechanism for the
origin server to direct clients to discard these cached credentials,
since the protocol has no awareness of how credentials are obtained or

### [18.4.](#section-18.4){.section-number .selfRef} [Field Name Registration](#name-field-name-registration){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-field-name-registration}

This specification updates the HTTP-related aspects of the existing
registration procedures for message header fields defined in
\[[RFC3864](#RFC3864){.xref}\]. It replaces the old procedures as they
relate to HTTP by defining a new registration procedure and moving HTTP
field definitions into a separate
registry.[¶](#section-18.4-1){.pilcrow}

IANA has created a new registry titled \"Hypertext Transfer Protocol
(HTTP) Field Name Registry\" as outlined in [Section
16.3.1](#fields.registry){.xref}.[¶](#section-18.4-2){.pilcrow}

IANA has moved all entries in the \"Permanent Message Header Field
Names\" and \"Provisional Message Header Field Names\" registries (see
\<<https://www.iana.org/assignments/message-headers/>\>) with the
protocol \'http\' to this registry and has applied the following
changes:[¶](#section-18.4-3){.pilcrow}

1.  [The \'Applicable Protocol\' field has been
    omitted.[¶](#section-18.4-4.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-18.4-4.1}
2.  [Entries that had a status of \'standard\', \'experimental\',
    \'reserved\', or \'informational\' have been made to have a status
    of
    \'permanent\'.[¶](#section-18.4-4.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-18.4-4.2}
3.  [Provisional entries without a status have been made to have a
    status of
    \'provisional\'.[¶](#section-18.4-4.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-18.4-4.3}
4.  [Permanent entries without a status (after confirmation that the
    registration document did not define one) have been made to have a
    status of \'provisional\'. The expert(s) can choose to update the
    entries\' status if there is evidence that another is more
    appropriate.[¶](#section-18.4-4.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-18.4-4.4}

IANA has annotated the \"Permanent Message Header Field Names\" and
\"Provisional Message Header Field Names\" registries with the following
note to indicate that HTTP field name registrations have
moved:[¶](#section-18.4-5){.pilcrow}

**Note**[¶](#section-18.4-6.1){.pilcrow}

HTTP field name registrations have been moved to
\[<https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-fields>\] per
\[RFC9110\].[¶](#section-18.4-6.2){.pilcrow}

IANA has updated the \"Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Field Name

### [B.2.](#appendix-B.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Changes from RFC 7230](#name-changes-from-rfc-7230){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-changes-from-rfc-7230}

The sections introducing HTTP\'s design goals, history, architecture,
conformance criteria, protocol versioning, URIs, message routing, and
header fields have been moved here.[¶](#appendix-B.2-1){.pilcrow}

The requirement on semantic conformance has been replaced with
permission to ignore or work around implementation-specific failures.
([Section
2.2](#requirements.notation){.xref})[¶](#appendix-B.2-2){.pilcrow}

The description of an origin and authoritative access to origin servers
has been extended for both \"http\" and \"https\" URIs to account for
alternative services and secured connections that are not necessarily
based on TCP. (Sections [4.2.1](#http.uri){.xref},
[4.2.2](#https.uri){.xref}, [4.3.1](#origin){.xref}, and
[7.3.3](#routing.origin){.xref})[¶](#appendix-B.2-3){.pilcrow}

Explicit requirements have been added to check the target URI scheme\'s
semantics and reject requests that don\'t meet any associated
requirements. ([Section
7.4](#routing.reject){.xref})[¶](#appendix-B.2-4){.pilcrow}

Parameters in media type, media range, and expectation can be empty via
one or more trailing semicolons. ([Section
5.6.6](#parameter){.xref})[¶](#appendix-B.2-5){.pilcrow}

\"Field value\" now refers to the value after multiple field lines are
combined with commas \-- by far the most common use. To refer to a
single header line\'s value, use \"field line value\". ([Section
6.3](#header.fields){.xref})[¶](#appendix-B.2-6){.pilcrow}

Trailer field semantics now transcend the specifics of chunked transfer
coding. The use of trailer fields has been further limited to allow
generation as a trailer field only when the sender knows the field
defines that usage and to allow merging into the header section only if
the recipient knows the corresponding field definition permits and
defines how to merge. In all other cases, implementations are encouraged
either to store the trailer fields separately or to discard them instead
of merging. ([Section
6.5.1](#trailers.limitations){.xref})[¶](#appendix-B.2-7){.pilcrow}

The priority of the absolute form of the request URI over the Host
header field by origin servers has been made explicit to align with
proxy handling. ([Section
7.2](#field.host){.xref})[¶](#appendix-B.2-8){.pilcrow}

The grammar definition for the Via field\'s \"received-by\" was expanded
in RFC 7230 due to changes in the URI grammar for host
\[[URI](#URI){.xref}\] that are not desirable for Via. For simplicity,
we have removed uri-host from the received-by production because it can
be encompassed by the existing grammar for pseudonym. In particular,
this change removed comma from the allowed set of characters for a host
name in received-by. ([Section
7.6.3](#field.via){.xref})[¶](#appendix-B.2-9){.pilcrow}

Minimum URI lengths to be supported by implementations are now
recommended. ([Section
4.1](#uri.references){.xref})[¶](#appendix-B.3-1){.pilcrow}

The following have been clarified: CR and NUL in field values are to be
rejected or mapped to SP, and leading and trailing whitespace needs to
be stripped from field values before they are consumed. ([Section
5.5](#fields.values){.xref})[¶](#appendix-B.3-2){.pilcrow}

Parameters in media type, media range, and expectation can be empty via
one or more trailing semicolons. ([Section
5.6.6](#parameter){.xref})[¶](#appendix-B.3-3){.pilcrow}

An abstract data type for HTTP messages has been introduced to define
the components of a message and their semantics as an abstraction across
multiple HTTP versions, rather than in terms of the specific syntax form
of HTTP/1.1 in \[[HTTP/1.1](#HTTP11){.xref}\], and reflect the contents
after the message is parsed. This makes it easier to distinguish between
requirements on the content (what is conveyed) versus requirements on
the messaging syntax (how it is conveyed) and avoids baking limitations
of early protocol versions into the future of HTTP. ([Section
6](#message.abstraction){.xref})[¶](#appendix-B.3-4){.pilcrow}

The terms \"payload\" and \"payload body\" have been replaced with
\"content\", to better align with its usage elsewhere (e.g., in field
names) and to avoid confusion with frame payloads in HTTP/2 and HTTP/3.
([Section 6.4](#content){.xref})[¶](#appendix-B.3-5){.pilcrow}

The term \"effective request URI\" has been replaced with \"target
URI\". ([Section
7.1](#target.resource){.xref})[¶](#appendix-B.3-6){.pilcrow}

Restrictions on client retries have been loosened to reflect
implementation behavior. ([Section
9.2.2](#idempotent.methods){.xref})[¶](#appendix-B.3-7){.pilcrow}

The fact that request bodies on GET, HEAD, and DELETE are not
interoperable has been clarified. (Sections [9.3.1](#GET){.xref},
[9.3.2](#HEAD){.xref}, and
[9.3.5](#DELETE){.xref})[¶](#appendix-B.3-8){.pilcrow}

The use of the [Content-Range](#field.content-range){.xref} header field
([Section 14.4](#field.content-range){.xref}) as a request modifier on
PUT is allowed. ([Section
9.3.4](#PUT){.xref})[¶](#appendix-B.3-9){.pilcrow}

A superfluous requirement about setting
[Content-Length](#field.content-length){.xref} has been removed from the
description of the OPTIONS method. ([Section
9.3.7](#OPTIONS){.xref})[¶](#appendix-B.3-10){.pilcrow}

The normative requirement to use the \"message/http\" media type in
TRACE responses has been removed. ([Section
9.3.8](#TRACE){.xref})[¶](#appendix-B.3-11){.pilcrow}

List-based grammar for [Expect](#field.expect){.xref} has been restored
for compatibility with RFC 2616. ([Section
10.1.1](#field.expect){.xref})[¶](#appendix-B.3-12){.pilcrow}

[Accept](#field.accept){.xref} and
[Accept-Encoding](#field.accept-encoding){.xref} are allowed in response
messages; the latter was introduced by \[[RFC7694](#RFC7694){.xref}\].
([Section
12.3](#request.content.negotiation){.xref})[¶](#appendix-B.3-13){.pilcrow}

\"Accept Parameters\" (accept-params and accept-ext ABNF production)
have been removed from the definition of the Accept field. ([Section
12.5.1](#field.accept){.xref})[¶](#appendix-B.3-14){.pilcrow}

The Accept-Charset field is now deprecated. ([Section
12.5.2](#field.accept-charset){.xref})[¶](#appendix-B.3-15){.pilcrow}

The semantics of \"\*\" in the [Vary](#field.vary){.xref} header field
when other values are present was clarified. ([Section
12.5.5](#field.vary){.xref})[¶](#appendix-B.3-16){.pilcrow}

Range units are compared in a case-insensitive fashion. ([Section
14.1](#range.units){.xref})[¶](#appendix-B.3-17){.pilcrow}

The use of the Accept-Ranges field is not restricted to origin servers.
([Section
14.3](#field.accept-ranges){.xref})[¶](#appendix-B.3-18){.pilcrow}

The process of creating a redirected request has been clarified.
([Section 15.4](#status.3xx){.xref})[¶](#appendix-B.3-19){.pilcrow}

Status code 308 (previously defined in \[[RFC7538](#RFC7538){.xref}\])
has been added so that it\'s defined closer to status codes 301, 302,
and 307. ([Section
15.4.9](#status.308){.xref})[¶](#appendix-B.3-20){.pilcrow}

Status code 421 (previously defined in [Section
9.1.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7540#section-9.1.2){.relref} of
\[[RFC7540](#RFC7540){.xref}\]) has been added because of its general
applicability. 421 is no longer defined as heuristically cacheable since
the response is specific to the connection (not the target resource).
([Section 15.5.20](#status.421){.xref})[¶](#appendix-B.3-21){.pilcrow}

Status code 422 (previously defined in [Section
11.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4918#section-11.2){.relref} of
\[[WEBDAV](#WEBDAV){.xref}\]) has been added because of its general
applicability. ([Section

Previous revisions of HTTP imposed an arbitrary 60-second limit on the
determination of whether Last-Modified was a strong validator to guard
against the possibility that the Date and Last-Modified values are
generated from different clocks or at somewhat different times during
the preparation of the response. This specification has relaxed that to
allow reasonable discretion. ([Section
8.8.2.2](#lastmod.comparison){.xref})[¶](#appendix-B.4-1){.pilcrow}

An edge-case requirement on If-Match and If-Unmodified-Since has been
removed that required a validator not to be sent in a 2xx response if
validation fails because the change request has already been applied.
(Sections [13.1.1](#field.if-match){.xref} and
[13.1.4](#field.if-unmodified-since){.xref})[¶](#appendix-B.4-2){.pilcrow}

The fact that If-Unmodified-Since does not apply to a resource without a
concept of modification time has been clarified. ([Section
13.1.4](#field.if-unmodified-since){.xref})[¶](#appendix-B.4-3){.pilcrow}

Preconditions can now be evaluated before the request content is
processed rather than waiting until the response would otherwise be
successful. ([Section

Refactored the range-unit and ranges-specifier grammars to simplify and
reduce artificial distinctions between bytes and other (extension) range
units, removing the overlapping grammar of other-range-unit by defining
range units generically as a token and placing extensions within the
scope of a range-spec (other-range). This disambiguates the role of list
syntax (commas) in all range sets, including extension range units, for
indicating a range-set of more than one range. Moving the extension
grammar into range specifiers also allows protocol specific to byte
ranges to be specified separately.[¶](#appendix-B.5-1){.pilcrow}

It is now possible to define Range handling on extension methods.
([Section 14.2](#field.range){.xref})[¶](#appendix-B.5-2){.pilcrow}

Described use of the [Content-Range](#field.content-range){.xref} header
field ([Section 14.4](#field.content-range){.xref}) as a request
