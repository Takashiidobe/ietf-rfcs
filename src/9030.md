# RFC 9030 {#rfcnum}

# An Architecture for IPv6 over the Time-Slotted Channel Hopping Mode of IEEE 802.15.4 (6TiSCH) {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

This document describes a network architecture that provides
low-latency, low-jitter, and high-reliability packet delivery. It
combines a high-speed powered backbone and subnetworks using IEEE
802.15.4 time-slotted channel hopping (TSCH) to meet the requirements of
low-power wireless deterministic
applications.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

Wireless networks enable a wide variety of devices of any size to get
interconnected, often at a very low marginal cost per device, at any
range, and in circumstances where wiring may be impractical, for
instance, on fast-moving or rotating devices.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

On the other hand, Deterministic Networking maximizes the packet
delivery ratio within a bounded latency so as to enable mission-critical
machine-to-machine (M2M) operations. Applications that need such
networks are presented in \[[RFC8578](#RFC8578){.xref}\] and
\[[RAW-USE-CASES](#I-D.ietf-raw-use-cases){.xref}\], which presents a
number of additional use cases for Reliable and Available Wireless
networks (RAW). The considered applications include professional media,
Industrial Automation and Control Systems (IACS), building automation,
in-vehicle command and control, commercial automation and asset tracking
with mobile scenarios, as well as gaming, drones and edge robotic
control, and home automation applications.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

The Time-Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) \[[RFC7554](#RFC7554){.xref}\]
mode of the IEEE Std 802.15.4 \[[IEEE802154](#IEEE802154){.xref}\]
Medium Access Control (MAC) was introduced with the IEEE Std 802.15.4e
\[[IEEE802154e](#IEEE802154e){.xref}\] amendment and is now retrofitted
in the main standard. For all practical purposes, this document is
expected to be insensitive to the revisions of that standard, which is
thus referenced without a date. TSCH is both a Time-Division
Multiplexing (TDM) and a Frequency-Division Multiplexing (FDM)
technique, whereby a different channel can be used for each
transmission. TSCH allows the scheduling of transmissions for
deterministic operations and applies to the slower and most
energy-constrained wireless use cases.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

The scheduled operation provides for a more reliable experience, which
can be used to monitor and manage resources, e.g., energy and water, in
a more efficient fashion.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

Proven deterministic networking standards for use in process control,
including ISA100.11a \[[ISA100.11a](#ISA100.11a){.xref}\] and
WirelessHART \[[WirelessHART](#WirelessHART){.xref}\], have demonstrated
the capabilities of the IEEE Std 802.15.4 TSCH MAC for high reliability
against interference, low-power consumption on well-known flows, and its
applicability for Traffic Engineering (TE) from a central
controller.[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}

To enable the convergence of information technology (IT) and operational
technology (OT) in Low-Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs), the 6TiSCH
architecture supports an IETF suite of protocols over the IEEE Std
802.15.4 TSCH MAC to provide IP connectivity for energy and otherwise
constrained wireless devices.[¶](#section-1-6){.pilcrow}

The 6TiSCH architecture relies on IPv6 \[[RFC8200](#RFC8200){.xref}\]
and the use of routing to provide large scaling capabilities. The
addition of a high-speed federating backbone adds yet another degree of
scalability to the design. The backbone is typically a Layer 2 transit
link such as an Ethernet bridged network, but it can also be a more
complex routed structure.[¶](#section-1-7){.pilcrow}

The 6TiSCH architecture introduces an IPv6 multi-link subnet model that
is composed of a federating backbone and a number of IEEE Std 802.15.4
TSCH low-power wireless networks federated and synchronized by Backbone
Routers. If the backbone is a Layer 2 transit link, then the Backbone
Routers can operate as an IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (IPv6 ND) proxy
\[[RFC4861](#RFC4861){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-8){.pilcrow}

The 6TiSCH architecture leverages 6LoWPAN \[[RFC4944](#RFC4944){.xref}\]
to adapt IPv6 to the constrained media and the Routing Protocol for
Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) \[[RFC6550](#RFC6550){.xref}\] for
the distributed routing operations.[¶](#section-1-9){.pilcrow}

Centralized routing refers to a model where routes are computed and
resources are allocated from a central controller. This is particularly
helpful to schedule deterministic multihop transmissions. In contrast,
distributed routing refers to a model that relies on concurrent
peer-to-peer protocol exchanges for TSCH resource allocation and routing
operations.[¶](#section-1-10){.pilcrow}

The architecture defines mechanisms to establish and maintain routing
and scheduling in a centralized, distributed, or mixed fashion, for use
in multiple OT environments. It is applicable in particular to highly
scalable solutions such as those used in Advanced Metering
Infrastructure \[[AMI](#AMI){.xref}\] solutions that leverage
distributed routing to enable multipath forwarding over large LLN
meshes.[¶](#section-1-11){.pilcrow}

parlance.[¶](#section-2.1-1){.pilcrow}

This document adds the following terms:[¶](#section-2.1-2){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

6TiSCH (IPv6 over the TSCH mode of IEEE 802.15.4):
:   6TiSCH defines an adaptation sublayer for IPv6 over TSCH called
    6top, a set of protocols for setting up a TSCH schedule in
    distributed approach, and a security solution. 6TiSCH may be
    extended in the future for other MAC/Physical Layer (PHY) pairs
    providing a service similar to TSCH.[¶](#section-2.1-3.2){.pilcrow}
:   

6top (6TiSCH Operation Sublayer):
:   The next higher layer of the IEEE Std 802.15.4 TSCH MAC layer. 6top
    provides the abstraction of an IP link over a TSCH MAC, schedules
    packets over TSCH cells, and exposes a management interface to
    schedule TSCH cells.[¶](#section-2.1-3.4){.pilcrow}
:   

6P (6top Protocol):
:   The protocol defined in \[[RFC8480](#RFC8480){.xref}\]. 6P enables
    Layer 2 peers to allocate, move, or de-allocate cells in their
    respective schedules to communicate. 6P operates at the 6top
    sublayer.[¶](#section-2.1-3.6){.pilcrow}
:   

6P transaction:
:   A 2-way or 3-way sequence of 6P messages used by Layer 2 peers to
    modify their communication schedule.[¶](#section-2.1-3.8){.pilcrow}
:   

ASN (Absolute Slot Number):
:   Defined in \[[IEEE802154](#IEEE802154){.xref}\], the ASN is the
    total number of timeslots that have elapsed since the Epoch time
    when the TSCH network started. Incremented by one at each timeslot.
    It is wide enough to not roll over in
    practice.[¶](#section-2.1-3.10){.pilcrow}
:   

bundle:
:   A group of equivalent scheduled cells, i.e., cells identified by
    different slotOffset/channelOffset, which are scheduled for a same
    purpose, with the same neighbor, with the same flags, and the same
    slotframe. The size of the bundle refers to the number of cells it
    contains. For a given slotframe length, the size of the bundle
    translates directly into bandwidth. A bundle is a local abstraction
    that represents a half-duplex link for either sending or receiving,
    with bandwidth that amounts to the sum of the cells in the
    bundle.[¶](#section-2.1-3.12){.pilcrow}
:   

Layer 2 vs. Layer 3 bundle:
:   Bundles are associated with either Layer 2 (switching) or Layer 3
    (routing) forwarding operations. A pair of Layer 3 bundles (one for
    each direction) maps to an IP link with a neighbor, whereas a set of
    Layer 2 bundles (of an \"arbitrary\" cardinality and direction)
    corresponds to the relation of one or more incoming bundle(s) from
    the previous-hop neighbor(s) with one or more outgoing bundle(s) to
    the next-hop neighbor(s) along a Track as part of the switching
    role, which may include replication and
    elimination.[¶](#section-2.1-3.14){.pilcrow}
:   

CCA (Clear Channel Assessment):
:   A mechanism defined in \[[IEEE802154](#IEEE802154){.xref}\] whereby
    nodes listen to the channel before sending to detect ongoing
    transmissions from other parties. Because the network is
    synchronized, CCA cannot be used to detect colliding transmissions
    within the same network, but it can be used to detect other radio
    networks in the vicinity.[¶](#section-2.1-3.16){.pilcrow}
:   

cell:
:   A unit of transmission resource in the CDU matrix, a cell is
    identified by a slotOffset and a channelOffset. A cell can be
    scheduled or unscheduled.[¶](#section-2.1-3.18){.pilcrow}
:   

Channel Distribution/Usage (CDU) matrix:
:   : A matrix of cells (i,j) representing the spectrum (channel)
    distribution among the different nodes in the 6TiSCH network. The
    CDU matrix has width in timeslots equal to the period of the network
    scheduling operation, and height equal to the number of available
    channels. Every cell (i,j) in the CDU, identified by
    slotOffset/channelOffset, belongs to a specific
    chunk.[¶](#section-2.1-3.20){.pilcrow}
:   

channelOffset:
:   Identifies a row in the TSCH schedule. The number of channelOffset
    values is bounded by the number of available frequencies. The
    channelOffset translates into a frequency with a function that
    depends on the absolute time when the communication takes place,
    resulting in a channel-hopping
    operation.[¶](#section-2.1-3.22){.pilcrow}
:   

chunk:
:   A well-known list of cells, distributed in time and frequency,
    within a CDU matrix. A chunk represents a portion of a CDU matrix.
    The partition of the CDU matrix in chunks is globally known by all
    the nodes in the network to support the appropriation process, which
    is a negotiation between nodes within an interference domain. A node
    that manages to appropriate a chunk gets to decide which
    transmissions will occur over the cells in the chunk within its
    interference domain, i.e., a parent node will decide when the cells
    within the appropriated chunk are used and by which node among its
    children.[¶](#section-2.1-3.24){.pilcrow}
:   

CoJP (Constrained Join Protocol):
:   The Constrained Join Protocol (CoJP) enables a pledge to securely
    join a 6TiSCH network and obtain network parameters over a secure
    channel. \"[Constrained Join Protocol (CoJP) for
    6TiSCH](#RFC9031){.xref}\" \[[RFC9031](#RFC9031){.xref}\] defines
    the minimal CoJP setup with pre-shared keys defined. In that mode,
    CoJP can operate with a single round-trip
    exchange.[¶](#section-2.1-3.26){.pilcrow}
:   

dedicated cell:
:   A cell that is reserved for a given node to transmit to a specific
    neighbor.[¶](#section-2.1-3.28){.pilcrow}
:   

deterministic network:
:   The generic concept of a deterministic network is defined in the
    [\"Deterministic Networking Architecture\"](#RFC8655){.xref}
    \[[RFC8655](#RFC8655){.xref}\] document. When applied to 6TiSCH, it
    refers to the reservation of Tracks, which guarantees an end-to-end
    latency and optimizes the Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) for
    well-characterized flows.[¶](#section-2.1-3.30){.pilcrow}
:   

distributed cell reservation:
:   A reservation of a cell done by one or more in-network
    entities.[¶](#section-2.1-3.32){.pilcrow}
:   

distributed Track reservation:
:   A reservation of a Track done by one or more in-network
    entities.[¶](#section-2.1-3.34){.pilcrow}
:   

EB (Enhanced Beacon):
:   A special frame defined in \[[IEEE802154](#IEEE802154){.xref}\] used
    by a node, including the Join Proxy (JP), to announce the presence
    of the network. It contains enough information for a pledge to
    synchronize to the network.[¶](#section-2.1-3.36){.pilcrow}
:   

hard cell:
:   A scheduled cell that the 6top sublayer may not
    relocate.[¶](#section-2.1-3.38){.pilcrow}
:   

hopping sequence:
:   Ordered sequence of frequencies, identified by a
    Hopping_Sequence_ID, used for channel hopping when translating the
    channelOffset value into a
    frequency.[¶](#section-2.1-3.40){.pilcrow}
:   

IE (Information Element):
:   Type-Length-Value containers placed at the end of the MAC header and
    used to pass data between layers or devices. Some IE identifiers are
    managed by the IEEE \[[IEEE802154](#IEEE802154){.xref}\]. Some IE
    identifiers are managed by the IETF \[[RFC8137](#RFC8137){.xref}\].
    \[[RFC9032](#RFC9032){.xref}\] uses one subtype to support the
    selection of the Join Proxy.[¶](#section-2.1-3.42){.pilcrow}
:   

join process:
:   The overall process that includes the discovery of the network by
    pledge(s) and the execution of the join
    protocol.[¶](#section-2.1-3.44){.pilcrow}
:   

join protocol:
:   The protocol that allows the pledge to join the network. The join
    protocol encompasses authentication, authorization, and parameter
    distribution. The join protocol is executed between the pledge and
    the JRC.[¶](#section-2.1-3.46){.pilcrow}
:   

joined node:
:   The new device after having completed the join process, often just
    called a node.[¶](#section-2.1-3.48){.pilcrow}
:   

JP (Join Proxy):
:   A node already part of the 6TiSCH network that serves as a relay to
    provide connectivity between the pledge and the JRC. The JP
    announces the presence of the network by regularly sending EB
    frames.[¶](#section-2.1-3.50){.pilcrow}
:   

JRC (Join Registrar/Coordinator):
:   Central entity responsible for the authentication, authorization,
    and configuration of the pledge.[¶](#section-2.1-3.52){.pilcrow}
:   

link:
:   A communication facility or medium over which nodes can communicate
    at the link layer, which is the layer immediately below IP. In
    6TiSCH, the concept is implemented as a collection of Layer 3
    bundles. Note: the IETF parlance for the term \"link\" is adopted,
    as opposed to the IEEE Std 802.15.4
    terminology.[¶](#section-2.1-3.54){.pilcrow}
:   

operational technology:
:   OT refers to technology used in automation, for instance in
    industrial control networks. The convergence of IT and OT is the
    main object of the Industrial Internet of Things
    (IIOT).[¶](#section-2.1-3.56){.pilcrow}
:   

pledge:
:   A new device that attempts to join a 6TiSCH
    network.[¶](#section-2.1-3.58){.pilcrow}
:   

(to) relocate a cell:
:   The action operated by the 6top sublayer of changing the slotOffset
    and/or channelOffset of a soft cell.[¶](#section-2.1-3.60){.pilcrow}
:   

(to) schedule a cell:
:   The action of turning an unscheduled cell into a scheduled
    cell.[¶](#section-2.1-3.62){.pilcrow}
:   

scheduled cell:
:   A cell that is assigned a neighbor MAC address (broadcast address is
    also possible) and one or more of the following flags: TX, RX,
    Shared, and Timekeeping. A scheduled cell can be used by the IEEE
    Std 802.15.4 TSCH implementation to communicate. A scheduled cell
    can either be a hard or a soft cell.[¶](#section-2.1-3.64){.pilcrow}
:   

SF (6top Scheduling Function):
:   The cell management entity that adds or deletes cells dynamically
    based on application networking requirements. The cell negotiation
    with a neighbor is done using 6P.[¶](#section-2.1-3.66){.pilcrow}
:   

SFID (6top Scheduling Function Identifier):
:   A 4-bit field identifying an SF.[¶](#section-2.1-3.68){.pilcrow}
:   

shared cell:
:   A cell marked with both the TX and Shared flags. This cell can be
    used by more than one transmitter node. A back-off algorithm is used
    to resolve contention.[¶](#section-2.1-3.70){.pilcrow}
:   

slotframe:
:   A collection of timeslots repeating in time, analogous to a
    superframe in that it defines periods of communication
    opportunities. It is characterized by a slotframe_ID and a
    slotframe_size. Multiple slotframes can coexist in a node\'s
    schedule, i.e., a node can have multiple activities scheduled in
    different slotframes based on the priority of its packets/traffic
    flows. The timeslots in the slotframe are indexed by the slotOffset;
    the first timeslot is at slotOffset
    0.[¶](#section-2.1-3.72){.pilcrow}
:   

slotOffset:
:   A column in the TSCH schedule, i.e., the number of timeslots since
    the beginning of the current iteration of the
    slotframe.[¶](#section-2.1-3.74){.pilcrow}
:   

soft cell:
:   A scheduled cell that the 6top sublayer can
    relocate.[¶](#section-2.1-3.76){.pilcrow}
:   

time source neighbor:
:   A neighbor that a node uses as its time reference, and to which it
    needs to keep its clock
    synchronized.[¶](#section-2.1-3.78){.pilcrow}
:   

timeslot:
:   A basic communication unit in TSCH that allows a transmitter node to
    send a frame to a receiver neighbor and that allows the receiver
    neighbor to optionally send back an
    acknowledgment.[¶](#section-2.1-3.80){.pilcrow}
:   

Track:
:   A Track is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that is used as a complex
    multihop path to the destination(s) of the path. In the case of
    unicast traffic, the Track is a Destination-Oriented DAG (DODAG)
    where the Root of the DODAG is the destination of the unicast
    traffic. A Track enables replication, elimination, and reordering
    functions on the way (more on those functions in
    \[[RFC8655](#RFC8655){.xref}\]). A Track reservation locks physical
    resources such as cells and buffers in every node along the DODAG. A
    Track is associated with an owner, which can be for instance the
    destination of the Track.[¶](#section-2.1-3.82){.pilcrow}
:   

TrackID:
:   A TrackID is either globally unique or locally unique to the Track
    owner, in which case the identification of the owner must be
    provided together with the TrackID to provide a full reference to
    the Track. Typically, the Track owner is the ingress of the Track,
    the IPv6 source address of packets along the Track can be used as
    identification of the owner, and a local InstanceID
    \[[RFC6550](#RFC6550){.xref}\] in the namespace of that owner can be
    used as TrackID. If the Track is reversible, then the owner is found
    in the IPv6 destination address of a packet coming back along the
    Track. In that case, a RPL Packet Information
    \[[RFC6550](#RFC6550){.xref}\] in an IPv6 packet can unambiguously
    identify the Track and can be expressed in a compressed form using
    \[[RFC8138](#RFC8138){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2.1-3.84){.pilcrow}
:   

TSCH:
:   A medium access mode of the [IEEE Std 802.15.4](#IEEE802154){.xref}
    \[[IEEE802154](#IEEE802154){.xref}\] standard that uses time
    synchronization to achieve ultra-low-power operation and channel
    hopping to enable high reliability.[¶](#section-2.1-3.86){.pilcrow}
:   

TSCH Schedule:
:   A matrix of cells, with each cell indexed by a slotOffset and a
    channelOffset. The TSCH schedule contains all the scheduled cells
    from all slotframes and is sufficient to qualify the communication
    in the TSCH network. The number of channelOffset values (the
    \"height\" of the matrix) is equal to the number of available
    frequencies.[¶](#section-2.1-3.88){.pilcrow}
:   

Unscheduled Cell:
:   A cell that is not used by the IEEE Std 802.15.4 TSCH
    implementation.[¶](#section-2.1-3.90){.pilcrow}

Inside a 6TiSCH LLN, nodes rely on [6LoWPAN header compression (6LoWPAN
HC)](#RFC6282){.xref} \[[RFC6282](#RFC6282){.xref}\] to encode IPv6
packets. From the perspective of the network layer, a single LLN
interface (typically an IEEE Std 802.15.4-compliant radio) may be seen
as a collection of links with different capabilities for unicast or
multicast services.[¶](#section-3.1-3){.pilcrow}

6TiSCH nodes join a mesh network by attaching to nodes that are already
members of the mesh (see [Section 4.2.1](#rflo){.xref}). The security
aspects of the join process are further detailed in [Section
6](#sec){.xref}. In a mesh network, 6TiSCH nodes are not necessarily
reachable from one another at Layer 2, and an LLN may span over multiple
links.[¶](#section-3.1-4){.pilcrow}

This forms a homogeneous non-broadcast multi-access (NBMA) subnet, which
is beyond the scope of IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (IPv6 ND)
\[[RFC4861](#RFC4861){.xref}\] \[[RFC4862](#RFC4862){.xref}\]. 6LoWPAN
Neighbor Discovery (6LoWPAN ND) \[[RFC6775](#RFC6775){.xref}\]
\[[RFC8505](#RFC8505){.xref}\] specifies extensions to IPv6 ND that
enable ND operations in this type of subnet that can be protected
against address theft and impersonation with
\[[RFC8928](#RFC8928){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3.1-5){.pilcrow}

Once it has joined the 6TiSCH network, a node acquires IPv6 addresses
and registers them using 6LoWPAN ND. This guarantees that the addresses
are unique and protects the address ownership over the subnet, more in
[Section 4.2.2](#rreg){.xref}.[¶](#section-3.1-6){.pilcrow}

Within the NBMA subnet, [RPL](#RFC6550){.xref}
\[[RFC6550](#RFC6550){.xref}\] enables routing in the so-called
\"route-over\" fashion, either in storing (stateful) or non-storing
(stateless, with routing headers) mode. From there, some nodes can act
as routers for 6LoWPAN ND and RPL operations, as detailed in [Section
4.1](#RPLvs6lo){.xref}.[¶](#section-3.1-7){.pilcrow}

With TSCH, devices are time synchronized at the MAC level. The use of a
particular RPL Instance for time synchronization is discussed in
[Section 4.3.4](#sync){.xref}. With this mechanism, the time
synchronization starts at the RPL Root and follows the RPL loopless
routing topology.[¶](#section-3.1-8){.pilcrow}

RPL forms Destination-Oriented Directed Acyclic Graphs (DODAGs) within
Instances of the protocol, each Instance being associated with an
Objective Function (OF) to form a routing topology. A particular 6TiSCH
node, the LLN Border Router (6LBR), acts as RPL Root, 6LoWPAN HC
terminator, and Border Router for the LLN to the outside. The 6LBR is
usually powered. More on RPL Instances can be found in Section
[3.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6550#section-3.1){.relref} of
[RPL](#RFC6550){.xref} \[[RFC6550](#RFC6550){.xref}\], in particular

RPL Identifiers\" and
\"[3.1.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6550#section-3.1.3){.relref}
Instances, DODAGs, and DODAG Versions\". RPL adds artifacts in the data
packets that are compressed with a [6LoWPAN Routing Header
(6LoRH)](#RFC8138){.xref} \[[RFC8138](#RFC8138){.xref}\]. In a
preexisting network, the compression can be globally turned on in a
DODAG once all nodes are migrated to support
\[[RFC8138](#RFC8138){.xref}\] using
\[[RFC9035](#RFC9035){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3.1-9){.pilcrow}

Additional routing and scheduling protocols may be deployed to establish
on-demand, peer-to-peer routes with particular characteristics inside
the 6TiSCH network. This may be achieved in a centralized fashion by a
Path Computation Element (PCE) \[[PCE](#PCE){.xref}\] that programs both
the routes and the schedules inside the 6TiSCH nodes or in a distributed
fashion by using a reactive routing protocol and a hop-by-hop scheduling
protocol.[¶](#section-3.1-10){.pilcrow}

This architecture expects that a 6LoWPAN node can connect as a leaf to a
RPL network, where the leaf support is the minimal functionality to
connect as a host to a RPL network without the need to participate in
the full routing protocol. The architecture also expects that a 6LoWPAN
node that is unaware of RPL may also connect as described in
\[[RFC9010](#RFC9010){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3.1-11){.pilcrow}

:::

A Routing Registrar that performs proxy IPv6 ND operations over the
backbone on behalf of the 6TiSCH nodes is called a Backbone Router
(6BBR) \[[RFC8929](#RFC8929){.xref}\]. The 6BBRs are placed along the
wireless edge of a backbone and federate multiple wireless links to form
a single multi-link subnet. The 6BBRs synchronize with one another over
the backbone, so as to ensure that the multiple LLNs that form the IPv6
subnet stay tightly synchronized.[¶](#section-3.2-4){.pilcrow}

The use of multicast can also be reduced on the backbone with a
registrar that would contribute to Duplicate Address Detection as well
as address lookup using only unicast request/response exchanges.
\[[ND-UNICAST-LOOKUP](#I-D.thubert-6man-unicast-lookup){.xref}\] is a
proposed method that presents an example of how this could be achieved
with an extension of \[[RFC8505](#RFC8505){.xref}\], using an optional
6LBR as a subnet-level registrar, as illustrated in [Figure
2](#fig2){.xref}.[¶](#section-3.2-5){.pilcrow}

As detailed in [Section 4.1](#RPLvs6lo){.xref}, the 6LBR that serves the
LLN and the Root of the RPL network need to share information about the
devices that are learned through either 6LoWPAN ND or RPL, but not both.
The preferred way of achieving this is to co-locate or combine them. The
combined RPL Root and 6LBR may be co-located with the 6BBR, or directly
attached to the 6BBR. In the latter case, it leverages the extended
registration process defined in \[[RFC8505](#RFC8505){.xref}\] to proxy
the 6LoWPAN ND registration to the 6BBR on behalf of the LLN nodes, so
that the 6BBR may in turn perform classical ND operations over the
backbone as a proxy.[¶](#section-3.2-6){.pilcrow}

The [\"Deterministic Networking Architecture\"](#RFC8655){.xref}
\[[RFC8655](#RFC8655){.xref}\] studies Layer 3 aspects of Deterministic
Networks and covers networks that span multiple Layer 2 domains. If the
backbone is deterministic (such as defined by the Time-Sensitive
Networking (TSN) Task Group at IEEE), then the Backbone Router ensures
that the end-to-end deterministic behavior is maintained between the LLN
and the backbone.[¶](#section-3.2-7){.pilcrow}

Though at a different time scale (several orders of magnitude), both
IEEE Std 802.1 TSN and IEEE Std 802.15.4 TSCH standards provide
deterministic capabilities to the point that a packet pertaining to a
certain flow may traverse a network from node to node following a
precise schedule, as a train that enters and then leaves intermediate
stations at precise times along its path.[¶](#section-3.3-1){.pilcrow}

With TSCH, time is formatted into timeslots, and individual
communication cells are allocated to unicast or broadcast communication
at the MAC level. The time-slotted operation reduces collisions, saves
energy, and enables more closely engineering the network for
deterministic properties. The channel-hopping aspect is a simple and
efficient technique to combat multipath fading and co-channel
interference.[¶](#section-3.3-2){.pilcrow}

6TiSCH builds on the IEEE Std 802.15.4 TSCH MAC and inherits its
advanced capabilities to enable them in multiple environments where they
can be leveraged to improve automated operations. The 6TiSCH
architecture also inherits the capability to perform a centralized route
computation to achieve deterministic properties, though it relies on the
IETF [DetNet architecture](#RFC8655){.xref}
\[[RFC8655](#RFC8655){.xref}\] and IETF components such as the PCE
\[[PCE](#PCE){.xref}\] for the protocol
aspects.[¶](#section-3.3-3){.pilcrow}

On top of this inheritance, 6TiSCH adds capabilities for distributed
routing and scheduling operations based on RPL and capabilities for
negotiating schedule adjustments between peers. These distributed
routing and scheduling operations simplify the deployment of TSCH
networks and enable wireless solutions in a larger variety of use cases
from operational technology in general. Examples of such use cases in
industrial environments include plant setup and decommissioning, as well
as monitoring a multiplicity of minor notifications such as corrosion
measurements, events, and access of local devices by mobile
workers.[¶](#section-3.3-4){.pilcrow}
:::

::: {#section-3.4 .section}
### [3.4.](#section-3.4){.section-number .selfRef} [Scheduling TSCH](#name-scheduling-tsch){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-scheduling-tsch}

A scheduling operation allocates cells in a TDM/FDM matrix called a CDU
either to individual transmissions or as multi-access shared resources.
The CDU matrix can be formatted in chunks that can be allocated
exclusively to particular nodes to enable distributed scheduling without
collision. More in [Section
4.3.5](#slotframes){.xref}.[¶](#section-3.4-1){.pilcrow}

At the MAC layer, the schedule of a 6TiSCH node is the collection of the
timeslots at which it must wake up for transmission, and the channels to
which it should either send or listen at those times. The schedule is
expressed as one or more repeating slotframes. Slotframes may collide
and require a device to wake up at a same time, in which case the
slotframe with the highest priority is
actionable.[¶](#section-3.4-2){.pilcrow}

The 6top sublayer (see [Section 4.3](#s6Pprot){.xref} for more) hides
the complexity of the schedule from the upper layers. The link
abstraction that IP traffic utilizes is composed of a pair of Layer 3
cell bundles, one to receive and one to transmit. Some of the cells may
be shared, in which case the 6top sublayer must perform some
arbitration.[¶](#section-3.4-3){.pilcrow}

Scheduling enables multiple simultaneous communications in a same
interference domain using different channels; but a node equipped with a
single radio can only either transmit or receive on one channel at any
point of time. Scheduled cells that fulfill the same role, e.g., receive
IP packets from a peer, are grouped in
bundles.[¶](#section-3.4-4){.pilcrow}

The 6TiSCH architecture identifies four ways a schedule can be managed
and CDU cells can be allocated: Static Scheduling, Neighbor-to-Neighbor
Scheduling, Centralized (or Remote) Monitoring and Schedule Management,
and Hop-by-Hop Scheduling.[¶](#section-3.4-5){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

Static Scheduling:
:   This refers to the minimal 6TiSCH operation whereby a static
    schedule is configured for the whole network for use in a Slotted
    ALOHA \[[S-ALOHA](#S-ALOHA){.xref}\] fashion. The static schedule is
    distributed through the native methods in the TSCH MAC layer and
    does not preclude other scheduling operations coexisting on a same
    6TiSCH network. A static schedule is necessary for basic operations
    such as the join process and for interoperability during the network
    formation, which is specified as part of the [Minimal 6TiSCH
    Configuration](#RFC8180){.xref}
    \[[RFC8180](#RFC8180){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3.4-6.2){.pilcrow}
:   

Neighbor-to-Neighbor Scheduling:
:   This refers to the dynamic adaptation of the bandwidth of the links
    that are used for IPv6 traffic between adjacent peers. Scheduling
    Functions such as the [\"6TiSCH Minimal Scheduling Function
    (MSF)\"](#RFC9033){.xref} \[[RFC9033](#RFC9033){.xref}\] influence
    the operation of the MAC layer to add, update, and remove cells in
    its own and its peer\'s schedules using 6P
    \[[RFC8480](#RFC8480){.xref}\] for the negotiation of the MAC
    resources.[¶](#section-3.4-6.4){.pilcrow}
:   

Centralized (or Remote) Monitoring and Schedule Management:
:   This refers to the central computation of a schedule and the
    capability to forward a frame based on the cell of arrival. In that
    case, the related portion of the device schedule as well as other
    device resources are managed by an abstract Network Management
    Entity (NME), which may cooperate with the PCE to minimize the
    interaction with, and the load on, the constrained device. This
    model is the TSCH adaption of the [DetNet
    architecture](#RFC8655){.xref} \[[RFC8655](#RFC8655){.xref}\], and
    it enables Traffic Engineering with deterministic
    properties.[¶](#section-3.4-6.6){.pilcrow}
:   

Hop-by-Hop Scheduling:
:   This refers to the possibility of reserving cells along a path for a
    particular flow using a distributed
    mechanism.[¶](#section-3.4-6.8){.pilcrow}
:   

It is not expected that all use cases will require all those mechanisms.
Static Scheduling with minimal configuration is the only one that is
expected in all implementations, since it provides a simple and solid
basis for convergecast routing and time
distribution.[¶](#section-3.4-7){.pilcrow}

6TiSCH enables a mixed model of centralized routes and distributed
routes. Centralized routes can, for example, be computed by an entity
such as a PCE. 6TiSCH leverages [RPL](#RFC6550){.xref}
\[[RFC6550](#RFC6550){.xref}\] for interoperable, distributed routing
operations.[¶](#section-3.5-1){.pilcrow}

Both methods may inject routes into the routing tables of the 6TiSCH
routers. In either case, each route is associated with a 6TiSCH topology
that can be a RPL Instance topology or a Track. The 6TiSCH topology is
indexed by a RPLInstanceID, in a format that reuses the RPLInstanceID as
defined in RPL.[¶](#section-3.5-2){.pilcrow}

[RPL](#RFC6550){.xref} \[[RFC6550](#RFC6550){.xref}\] is applicable to
Static Scheduling and Neighbor-to-Neighbor Scheduling. The architecture
also supports a centralized routing model for Remote Monitoring and
Schedule Management. It is expected that a routing protocol that is more
optimized for point-to-point routing than [RPL](#RFC6550){.xref}
\[[RFC6550](#RFC6550){.xref}\], such as the [\"Asymmetric AODV-P2P-RPL
in Low-Power and Lossy Networks\"
(AODV-RPL)](#I-D.ietf-roll-aodv-rpl){.xref}
\[[AODV-RPL](#I-D.ietf-roll-aodv-rpl){.xref}\], which derives from the
[\"Ad Hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODVv2)
Routing\"](#I-D.ietf-manet-aodvv2){.xref}
\[[AODVv2](#I-D.ietf-manet-aodvv2){.xref}\], will be selected for
Hop-by-Hop Scheduling.[¶](#section-3.5-3){.pilcrow}

Both RPL and PCE rely on shared sources such as policies to define
global and local RPLInstanceIDs that can be used by either method. It is
possible for centralized and distributed routing to share the same
topology. Generally they will operate in different slotframes, and
centralized routes will be used for scheduled traffic and will have
precedence over distributed routes in case of conflict between the
slotframes.[¶](#section-3.5-4){.pilcrow}

### [3.6.](#section-3.6){.section-number .selfRef} [Forwarding over TSCH](#name-forwarding-over-tsch){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-forwarding-over-tsch}

The 6TiSCH architecture supports three different forwarding models. One
is the classical IPv6 Forwarding, where the node selects a feasible
successor at Layer 3 on a per-packet basis and based on its routing
table. The second derives from Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) for so-called
Track Forwarding, whereby a frame received at a particular timeslot can
be switched into another timeslot at Layer 2 without regard to the
upper-layer protocol. The third model is the 6LoWPAN Fragment
Forwarding, which allows the forwarding individual 6LoWPAN fragments
along a route that is set up by the first
fragment.[¶](#section-3.6-1){.pilcrow}

In more detail:[¶](#section-3.6-2){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

IPv6 Forwarding:
:   This is the classical IP forwarding model, with a Routing
    Information Base (RIB) that is installed by RPL and used to select a
    feasible successor per packet. The packet is placed on an outgoing
    link, which the 6top sublayer maps into a (Layer 3) bundle of cells,
    and scheduled for transmission based on QoS parameters. Besides RPL,
    this model also applies to any routing protocol that may be operated
    in the 6TiSCH network and corresponds to all the distributed
    scheduling models: Static, Neighbor-to-Neighbor, and Hop-by-Hop
    Scheduling.[¶](#section-3.6-3.2){.pilcrow}
:   

GMPLS Track Forwarding:
:   This model corresponds to the Remote Monitoring and Schedule
    Management. In this model, a central controller (hosting a PCE)
    computes and installs the schedules in the devices per flow. The
    incoming (Layer 2) bundle of cells from the previous node along the
    path determines the outgoing (Layer 2) bundle towards the next hop
    for that flow as determined by the PCE. The programmed sequence for
    bundles is called a Track and can assume DAG shapes that are more
    complex than a simple direct sequence of
    nodes.[¶](#section-3.6-3.4){.pilcrow}
:   

6LoWPAN Fragment Forwarding:
:   This is a hybrid model that derives from IPv6 forwarding for the
    case where packets must be fragmented at the 6LoWPAN sublayer. The
    first fragment is forwarded like any IPv6 packet and leaves a state
    in the intermediate hops to enable forwarding of the next fragments
    that do not have an IP header without the need to recompose the
    packet at every hop.[¶](#section-3.6-3.6){.pilcrow}

RPL is the routing protocol of choice for LLNs. So far, there is no
identified need to define a 6TiSCH-specific Objective Function. The
[Minimal 6TiSCH Configuration](#RFC8180){.xref}
\[[RFC8180](#RFC8180){.xref}\] describes the operation of RPL over a
static schedule used in a Slotted ALOHA fashion
\[[S-ALOHA](#S-ALOHA){.xref}\], whereby all active slots may be used for
emission or reception of both unicast and multicast
frames.[¶](#section-3.7-5){.pilcrow}

[6LoWPAN header compression](#RFC6282){.xref}
\[[RFC6282](#RFC6282){.xref}\] is used to compress the IPv6 and UDP
headers, whereas the [6LoWPAN Routing Header (6LoRH)](#RFC8138){.xref}
\[[RFC8138](#RFC8138){.xref}\] is used to compress the RPL artifacts in
the IPv6 data packets, including the RPL Packet Information (RPI), the
IP-in-IP encapsulation to/from the RPL Root, and the Source Routing
Header (SRH) in non-storing mode. \"[Using RPI Option Type, Routing
Header for Source Routes, and IPv6-in-IPv6 Encapsulation in the RPL Data
Plane](#RFC9008){.xref}\" \[[RFC9008](#RFC9008){.xref}\] provides the
details on when headers or encapsulation are
needed.[¶](#section-3.7-6){.pilcrow}

The [Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments
(OSCORE)](#RFC8613){.xref} \[[RFC8613](#RFC8613){.xref}\] is leveraged
by the Constrained Join Protocol (CoJP) and is expected to be the
primary protocol for the protection of the application payload as well.
The application payload may also be protected by the [Datagram Transport
Layer Security (DTLS)](#RFC6347){.xref} \[[RFC6347](#RFC6347){.xref}\]
sitting either under CoAP or over CoAP so it can traverse
proxies.[¶](#section-3.7-7){.pilcrow}

The 6TiSCH Operation Sublayer (6top) is a sublayer of a Logical Link
Control (LLC) that provides the abstraction of an IP link over a TSCH
MAC and schedules packets over TSCH cells, as further discussed in the
next sections, providing in particular dynamic cell allocation with the
6top Protocol (6P)
\[[RFC8480](#RFC8480){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3.7-8){.pilcrow}

The reference stack presented in this document was implemented and
interoperability-tested by a combination of open source, IETF, and ETSI
efforts. One goal is to help other bodies to adopt the stack as a whole,
making the effort to move to an IPv6-based IoT stack
easier.[¶](#section-3.7-9){.pilcrow}

For a particular environment, some of the choices that are available in
this architecture may not be relevant. For instance, RPL is not required
for star topologies and mesh-under Layer 2 routed networks, and the
6LoWPAN compression may not be sufficient for ultra-constrained cases
such as some Low-Power Wide Area (LPWA) networks. In such cases, it is
perfectly doable to adopt a subset of the selection that is presented
hereafter and then select alternate components to complete the solution
wherever needed.[¶](#section-3.7-10){.pilcrow}

[Section 2.1](#sixTTerminology){.xref} provides the terms of
Communication Paradigms and Interaction Models in combination with [\"On
the Difference between Information Models and Data
Models\"](#RFC3444){.xref} \[[RFC3444](#RFC3444){.xref}\]. A
Communication Paradigm is an abstract view of a protocol exchange and
has an Information Model for the information that is being exchanged. In
contrast, an Interaction Model is more refined and points to standard
operation such as a Representational State Transfer (REST) \"GET\"
operation and matches a Data Model for the data that is provided over
the protocol exchange.[¶](#section-3.8-1){.pilcrow}

[Section
2.1.3](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-roll-rpl-industrial-applicability-02#section-2.1.3){.relref}
of
\[[RPL-APPLICABILITY](#I-D.ietf-roll-rpl-industrial-applicability){.xref}\]
and its following sections discuss application-layer paradigms such as
source-sink, which is a multipeer-to-multipeer model primarily used for
alarms and alerts, publish-subscribe, which is typically used for sensor
data, as well as peer-to-peer and peer-to-multipeer
communications.[¶](#section-3.8-2){.pilcrow}

Additional considerations on duocast \-- one sender, two receivers for
redundancy \-- and its N-cast generalization are also provided. Those
paradigms are frequently used in industrial automation, which is a major
use case for IEEE Std 802.15.4 TSCH wireless networks with
\[[ISA100.11a](#ISA100.11a){.xref}\] and
\[[WirelessHART](#WirelessHART){.xref}\], which provides a wireless
access to \[[HART](#HART){.xref}\] applications and
devices.[¶](#section-3.8-3){.pilcrow}

This document focuses on Communication Paradigms and Interaction Models
for packet forwarding and TSCH resources (cells) management. Management
mechanisms for the TSCH schedule at the link layer (one hop), network
layer (multihop along a Track), and application layer (remote control)
are discussed in [Section 4.4](#schd){.xref}. Link-layer frame
forwarding interactions are discussed in [Section 4.6](#fwd){.xref}, and
network-layer packet routing is addressed in [Section

A RPL DODAG is formed of a Root, a collection of routers, and leaves
that are hosts. Hosts are nodes that do not forward packets that they
did not generate. RPL-aware leaves will participate in RPL to advertise
their own addresses, whereas RPL-unaware leaves depend on a connected
RPL router to do so. RPL interacts with 6LoWPAN ND at multiple levels,
in particular at the Root and in the RPL-unaware
leaves.[¶](#section-4.1-1){.pilcrow}

RPL needs a set of information to advertise a leaf node through a
Destination Advertisement Object (DAO) message and establish
reachability.[¶](#section-4.1.1-1){.pilcrow}

[\"Routing for RPL Leaves\"](#RFC9010){.xref}
\[[RFC9010](#RFC9010){.xref}\] details the basic interaction of 6LoWPAN
ND and RPL and enables a plain 6LN that supports
\[[RFC8505](#RFC8505){.xref}\] to obtain return connectivity via the RPL
network as a RPL-unaware leaf. The leaf indicates that it requires
reachability services for the Registered Address from a Routing
Registrar by setting an \'R\' flag in the Extended Address Registration
Option \[[RFC8505](#RFC8505){.xref}\], and it provides a TID that maps
to the \"Path Sequence\" defined in [Section
6.7.8](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6550#section-6.7.8){.relref} of
\[[RFC6550](#RFC6550){.xref}\], and its operation is defined in [Section
7.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6550#section-7.2){.relref} of
\[[RFC6550](#RFC6550){.xref}\].[¶](#section-4.1.1-2){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC9010](#RFC9010){.xref}\] also enables the leaf to signal with the
RPLInstanceID that it wants to participate by using the Opaque field of
the EARO. On the backbone, the RPLInstanceID is expected to be mapped to
an overlay that matches the RPL Instance, e.g., a Virtual LAN (VLAN) or
a virtual routing and forwarding (VRF)
instance.[¶](#section-4.1.1-3){.pilcrow}

Though, at the time of this writing, the above specification enables a
model where the separation is possible, this architecture recommends
co-locating the functions of 6LBR and RPL
Root.[¶](#section-4.1.1-4){.pilcrow}
:::

With the 6LoWPAN ND \[[RFC6775](#RFC6775){.xref}\], information on the
6LBR is disseminated via an Authoritative Border Router Option (ABRO) in
RA messages. \[[RFC8505](#RFC8505){.xref}\] extends
\[[RFC6775](#RFC6775){.xref}\] to enable a registration for routing and
proxy ND. The capability to support \[[RFC8505](#RFC8505){.xref}\] is
indicated in the 6LoWPAN Capability Indication Option (6CIO). The
discovery and liveliness of the RPL Root are obtained through RPL
\[[RFC6550](#RFC6550){.xref}\] itself.[¶](#section-4.1.2-1){.pilcrow}

When 6LoWPAN ND is coupled with RPL, the 6LBR and RPL Root
functionalities are co-located in order that the address of the 6LBR is
indicated by RPL DODAG Information Object (DIO) messages and to
associate the ROVR from the Extended Duplicate Address
Request/Confirmation (EDAR/EDAC) exchange \[[RFC8505](#RFC8505){.xref}\]
with the state that is maintained by RPL.[¶](#section-4.1.2-2){.pilcrow}

[Section 7](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9010#section-7){.relref}
of \[[RFC9010](#RFC9010){.xref}\] specifies how the DAO messages are
used to reconfirm the registration, thus eliminating a duplication of
functionality between DAO and EDAR/EDAC messages, as illustrated in
[Figure 6](#figReg2){.xref}. \[[RFC9010](#RFC9010){.xref}\] also
provides the protocol elements that are needed when the 6LBR and RPL
Root functionalities are not co-located.[¶](#section-4.1.2-3){.pilcrow}

Even though the Root of the RPL network is integrated with the 6LBR, it
is logically separated from the Backbone Router (6BBR) that is used to
connect the 6TiSCH LLN to the backbone. This way, the Root has all
information from 6LoWPAN ND and RPL about the LLN devices attached to
it.[¶](#section-4.1.2-4){.pilcrow}

This architecture also expects that the Root of the RPL network
(proxy-)registers the 6TiSCH nodes on their behalf to the 6BBR, for
whatever operation the 6BBR performs on the backbone, such as ND proxy
or redistribution in a routing protocol. This relies on an extension of
the 6LoWPAN ND registration described in
\[[RFC8929](#RFC8929){.xref}\].[¶](#section-4.1.2-5){.pilcrow}

This model supports the movement of a 6TiSCH device across the
multi-link subnet and allows the proxy registration of 6TiSCH nodes deep
into the 6TiSCH LLN by the 6LBR / RPL Root. This is why in
\[[RFC8505](#RFC8505){.xref}\] the Registered Address is signaled in the
Target Address field of the Neighbor Solicitation (NS) message as
opposed to the IPv6 Source Address, which, in the case of a proxy
registration, is that of the 6LBR / RPL Root
itself.[¶](#section-4.1.2-6){.pilcrow}

A new device, called the pledge, undergoes the join protocol to become a
node in a 6TiSCH network. This usually occurs only once when the device
is first powered on. The pledge communicates with the Join
Registrar/Coordinator (JRC) of the network through a Join Proxy (JP), a
radio neighbor of the pledge.[¶](#section-4.2.1-1){.pilcrow}

The JP is discovered though MAC-layer beacons. When multiple JPs from
possibly multiple networks are visible, using trial and error until an
acceptable position in the right network is obtained becomes
inefficient. \[[RFC9032](#RFC9032){.xref}\] adds a new subtype in the
Information Element that was delegated to the IETF
\[[RFC8137](#RFC8137){.xref}\] and provides visibility into the network
that can be joined and the willingness of the JP and the Root to be used
by the pledge.[¶](#section-4.2.1-2){.pilcrow}

The join protocol provides the following
functionality:[¶](#section-4.2.1-3){.pilcrow}

-   [Mutual
    authentication[¶](#section-4.2.1-4.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.2.1-4.1}
-   [Authorization[¶](#section-4.2.1-4.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.2.1-4.2}
-   [Parameter distribution to the pledge over a secure
    channel[¶](#section-4.2.1-4.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.2.1-4.3}

The Minimal Security Framework for 6TiSCH \[[RFC9031](#RFC9031){.xref}\]
defines the minimal mechanisms required for this join process to occur
in a secure manner. The specification defines the Constrained Join
Protocol (CoJP), which is used to distribute the parameters to the
pledge over a secure session established through OSCORE
\[[RFC8613](#RFC8613){.xref}\] and which describes the secure
configuration of the network stack. In the minimal setting with
pre-shared keys (PSKs), CoJP allows the pledge to join after a single
round-trip exchange with the JRC. The provisioning of the PSK to the
pledge and the JRC needs to be done out of band, through a \'one-touch\'
bootstrapping process, which effectively enrolls the pledge into the
domain managed by the JRC.[¶](#section-4.2.1-5){.pilcrow}

In certain use cases, the \'one-touch\' bootstrapping is not feasible
due to the operational constraints, and the enrollment of the pledge
into the domain needs to occur in-band. This is handled through a
\'zero-touch\' extension of the Minimal Security Framework for 6TiSCH.
The zero-touch extension
\[[ZEROTOUCH-JOIN](#I-D.ietf-6tisch-dtsecurity-zerotouch-join){.xref}\]
leverages the \"[Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key Infrastructure
(BRSKI)](#RFC8995){.xref}\" \[[RFC8995](#RFC8995){.xref}\] work to
establish a shared secret between a pledge and the JRC without
necessarily having them belong to a common (security) domain at join
time. This happens through inter-domain communication occurring between
the JRC of the network and the domain of the pledge, represented by a
fourth entity, Manufacturer Authorized Signing Authority (MASA). Once
the zero-touch exchange completes, the CoJP exchange defined in
\[[RFC9031](#RFC9031){.xref}\] is carried over the secure session
established between the pledge and the
JRC.[¶](#section-4.2.1-6){.pilcrow}

[Figure 4](#figJoin){.xref} depicts the join process and where a
Link-Local Address (LLA) is used, versus a Global Unicast Address
(GUA).[¶](#section-4.2.1-7){.pilcrow}

Once the pledge successfully completes the CoJP exchange and becomes a
network node, it obtains the network prefix from neighboring routers and
registers its IPv6 addresses. As detailed in [Section
4.1](#RPLvs6lo){.xref}, the combined 6LoWPAN ND 6LBR and Root of the RPL
network learn information such as an identifier (device EUI-64
\[[RFC6775](#RFC6775){.xref}\] or a ROVR \[[RFC8505](#RFC8505){.xref}\]
(from 6LoWPAN ND)) and the updated Sequence Number (from RPL), and
perform 6LoWPAN ND proxy registration to the 6BBR on behalf of the LLN
nodes.[¶](#section-4.2.2-1){.pilcrow}

[Figure 5](#figReg){.xref} illustrates the initial IPv6 signaling that
enables a 6LN to form a global address and register it to a 6LBR using
6LoWPAN ND \[[RFC8505](#RFC8505){.xref}\]. It is then carried over RPL
to the RPL Root and then to the 6BBR. This flow happens just once when
the address is created and first
registered.[¶](#section-4.2.2-2){.pilcrow}

6TiSCH expects a high degree of scalability together with a distributed
routing functionality based on RPL. To achieve this goal, the spectrum
must be allocated in a way that allows for spatial reuse between zones
that will not interfere with one another. In a large and spatially
distributed network, a 6TiSCH node is often in a good position to
determine usage of the spectrum in its
vicinity.[¶](#section-4.3.1-1){.pilcrow}

With 6TiSCH, the abstraction of an IPv6 link is implemented as a pair of
bundles of cells, one in each direction. IP links are only enabled
between RPL parents and children. The 6TiSCH operation is optimal when
the size of a bundle minimizes both the energy wasted in idle listening
and the packet drops due to congestion loss, while packets are forwarded
within an acceptable latency.[¶](#section-4.3.1-2){.pilcrow}

Use cases for distributed routing are often associated with a
statistical distribution of best-effort traffic with variable needs for
bandwidth on each individual link. The 6TiSCH operation can remain
optimal if RPL parents can adjust, dynamically and with enough
reactivity to match the variations of best-effort traffic, the amount of
bandwidth that is used to communicate between themselves and their
children, in both directions. In turn, the agility to fulfill the needs
for additional cells improves when the number of interactions with other
devices and the protocol latencies are
minimized.[¶](#section-4.3.1-3){.pilcrow}

6top is a logical link control sitting between the IP layer and the TSCH
MAC layer, which provides the link abstraction that is required for IP
operations. The 6top Protocol, 6P, which is specified in
\[[RFC8480](#RFC8480){.xref}\], is one of the services provided by 6top.
In particular, the 6top services are available over a management API
that enables an external management entity to schedule cells and
slotframes, and allows the addition of complementary functionality, for
instance, a Scheduling Function that manages a dynamic schedule based on
observed resource usage as discussed in [Section
4.4.2](#dynsched){.xref}. For this purpose, the 6TiSCH architecture
differentiates \"soft\" cells and \"hard\"
cells.[¶](#section-4.3.1-4){.pilcrow}

\"Hard\" cells are cells that are owned and managed by a separate
scheduling entity (e.g., a PCE) that specifies the
slotOffset/channelOffset of the cells to be added/moved/deleted, in
which case 6top can only act as instructed and may not move hard cells

In contrast, \"soft\" cells are cells that 6top can manage locally. 6top
contains a monitoring process that monitors the performance of cells and
that can add and remove soft cells in the TSCH schedule to adapt to the
traffic needs, or move one when it performs poorly. To reserve a soft
cell, the higher layer does not indicate the exact
slotOffset/channelOffset of the cell to add, but rather the resulting
bandwidth and QoS requirements. When the monitoring process triggers a
cell reallocation, the two neighbor devices communicating over this cell
negotiate its new position in the TSCH
schedule.[¶](#section-4.3.1.2-1){.pilcrow}

bandwidth and an underlying service that maps those needs in the actual

The SF relies on 6top services that implement the [6top Protocol
(6P)](#RFC8480){.xref} \[[RFC8480](#RFC8480){.xref}\] to negotiate the
precise cells that will be allocated or freed based on the schedule of
the peer. For instance, it may be that a peer wants to use a particular
timeslot that is free in its schedule, but that timeslot is already in
use by the other peer to communicate with a third party on a different
cell. 6P enables the peers to find an agreement in a transactional
manner that ensures the final consistency of the nodes\'
state.[¶](#section-4.3.2-5){.pilcrow}

[MSF](#RFC9033){.xref} \[[RFC9033](#RFC9033){.xref}\] is one of the
possible Scheduling Functions. MSF uses the rendezvous slot from
\[[RFC8180](#RFC8180){.xref}\] for network discovery, neighbor
discovery, and any other broadcast.[¶](#section-4.3.2-6){.pilcrow}

For basic unicast communication with any neighbor, each node uses a
receive cell at a well-known slotOffset/channelOffset, which is derived
from a hash of their own MAC address. Nodes can reach any neighbor by
installing a transmit (shared) cell with slotOffset/channelOffset
derived from the neighbor\'s MAC address.[¶](#section-4.3.2-7){.pilcrow}

For child-parent links, MSF continuously monitors the load between
parents and children. It then uses 6P to install or remove unicast cells
whenever the current schedule appears to be under-provisioned or
over-provisioned.[¶](#section-4.3.2-8){.pilcrow}

An implementation of a [RPL](#RFC6550){.xref}
\[[RFC6550](#RFC6550){.xref}\] Objective Function (OF), such as the [RPL
Objective Function Zero (OF0)](#RFC6552){.xref}

Configuration](#RFC8180){.xref} \[[RFC8180](#RFC8180){.xref}\] to
support RPL over a static schedule, may leverage for its internal
computation the information maintained by
6top.[¶](#section-4.3.3-1){.pilcrow}

An OF may require metrics about reachability, such as the Expected
Transmission Count (ETX) metric \[[RFC6551](#RFC6551){.xref}\]. 6top
creates and maintains an abstract neighbor table, and this state may be
leveraged to feed an OF and/or store OF information as well. A neighbor
table entry may contain a set of statistics with respect to that
specific neighbor.[¶](#section-4.3.3-2){.pilcrow}

The neighbor information may include the time when the last packet has
been received from that neighbor, a set of cell quality metrics, e.g.,
received signal strength indication (RSSI) or link quality indicator
(LQI), the number of packets sent to the neighbor, or the number of
packets received from it. This information can be made available through
6top management APIs and used, for instance, to compute a Rank Increment
that will determine the selection of the preferred
parent.[¶](#section-4.3.3-3){.pilcrow}

6top provides statistics about the underlying layer so the OF can be
tuned to the nature of the TSCH MAC layer. 6top also enables the RPL OF
to influence the MAC behavior, for instance, by configuring the
periodicity of IEEE Std 802.15.4 Extended Beacons (EBs). By augmenting
the EB periodicity, it is possible to change the network dynamics so as
to improve the support of devices that may change their point of
attachment in the 6TiSCH network.[¶](#section-4.3.3-4){.pilcrow}

Some RPL control messages, such as the DODAG Information Object (DIO),
are ICMPv6 messages that are broadcast to all neighbor nodes. With
6TiSCH, the broadcast channel requirement is addressed by 6top by
configuring TSCH to provide a broadcast channel, as opposed to, for
instance, piggybacking the DIO messages in Layer 2 Enhanced Beacons
(EBs), which would produce undue timer coupling among layers and packet
size issues, and could conflict with the policy of production networks
where EBs are mostly eliminated to conserve
energy.[¶](#section-4.3.3-5){.pilcrow}

#### [4.3.4.](#section-4.3.4){.section-number .selfRef} [Network Synchronization](#name-network-synchronization){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-network-synchronization}

Nodes in a TSCH network must be time synchronized. A node keeps
synchronized to its time source neighbor through a combination of
frame-based and acknowledgment-based synchronization. To maximize
battery life and network throughput, it is advisable that RPL ICMP
discovery and maintenance traffic (governed by the Trickle timer) be
somehow coordinated with the transmission of time synchronization
packets (especially with Enhanced
Beacons).[¶](#section-4.3.4-1){.pilcrow}

This could be achieved through an interaction of the 6top sublayer and
the RPL Objective Function, or could be controlled by a management
entity.[¶](#section-4.3.4-2){.pilcrow}

Time distribution requires a loop-free structure. Nodes caught in a
synchronization loop will rapidly desynchronize from the network and
become isolated. 6TiSCH uses a RPL DAG with a dedicated global Instance
for the purpose of time synchronization. That Instance is referred to as
the Time Synchronization Global Instance (TSGI). The TSGI can be
operated in either of the three modes that are detailed in Section
[3.1.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6550#section-3.1.3){.relref}
of [RPL](#RFC6550){.xref} \[[RFC6550](#RFC6550){.xref}\], \"Instances,
DODAGs, and DODAG Versions\". Multiple uncoordinated DODAGs with
independent Roots may be used if all the Roots share a common time
source such as the Global Positioning System
(GPS).[¶](#section-4.3.4-3){.pilcrow}

In the absence of a common time source, the TSGI should form a single
DODAG with a virtual Root. A backbone network is then used to
synchronize and coordinate RPL operations between the Backbone Routers
that act as sinks for the LLN. Optionally, RPL\'s periodic operations
may be used to transport the network synchronization. This may mean that
6top would need to trigger (override) the Trickle timer if no other
traffic has occurred for such a time that nodes may get out of
synchronization.[¶](#section-4.3.4-4){.pilcrow}

A node that has not joined the TSGI advertises a MAC-level Join Priority
of 0xFF to notify its neighbors that is not capable of serving as time
parent. A node that has joined the TSGI advertises a MAC-level Join
Priority set to its DAGRank() in that Instance, where DAGRank() is the
operation specified in Section
[3.5.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6550#section-3.5.1){.relref}
of \[[RFC6550](#RFC6550){.xref}\], \"Rank
Comparison\".[¶](#section-4.3.4-5){.pilcrow}

The provisioning of a RPL Root is out of scope for both RPL and this
architecture, whereas RPL enables the propagation of configuration
information down the DODAG. This applies to the TSGI as well; a Root is
configured, or obtains by unspecified means, the knowledge of the
RPLInstanceID for the TSGI. The Root advertises its DagRank in the TSGI,
which must be less than 0xFF, as its Join Priority in its IEEE Std
802.15.4 EBs.[¶](#section-4.3.4-6){.pilcrow}

A node that reads a Join Priority of less than 0xFF should join the
neighbor with the lesser Join Priority and use it as time parent. If the
node is configured to serve as time parent, then the node should join
the TSGI, obtain a Rank in that Instance, and start advertising its own
DagRank in the TSGI as its Join Priority in its
EBs.[¶](#section-4.3.4-7){.pilcrow}

6TiSCH enables IPv6 best-effort (stochastic) transmissions over a MAC
layer that is also capable of scheduled (deterministic) transmissions. A
window of time is defined around the scheduled transmission where the
medium must, as much as practically feasible, be free of contending
energy to ensure that the medium is free of contending packets when the
time comes for a scheduled transmission. One simple way to obtain such a
window is to format time and frequencies in cells of transmission of
equal duration. This is the method that is adopted in IEEE Std 802.15.4
TSCH as well as the Long Term Evolution (LTE) of cellular
networks.[¶](#section-4.3.5-1){.pilcrow}

The 6TiSCH architecture defines a global concept that is called a
Channel Distribution and Usage (CDU) matrix to describe that formatting
of time and frequencies.[¶](#section-4.3.5-2){.pilcrow}

A CDU matrix is defined centrally as part of the network definition. It
is a matrix of cells with a height equal to the number of available
channels (indexed by channelOffsets) and a width (in timeslots) that is
the period of the network scheduling operation (indexed by slotOffsets)
for that CDU matrix. There are different models for scheduling the usage
of the cells, which place the responsibility of avoiding collisions
either on a central controller or on the devices themselves, at an extra
cost in terms of energy to scan for free cells (more in [Section
4.4](#schd){.xref}).[¶](#section-4.3.5-3){.pilcrow}

The size of a cell is a timeslot duration, and values of 10 to 15
milliseconds are typical in 802.15.4 TSCH to accommodate for the
transmission of a frame and an ack, including the security validation on
the receive side, which may take up to a few milliseconds on some device
architecture.[¶](#section-4.3.5-4){.pilcrow}

A CDU matrix iterates over a well-known channel rotation called the
hopping sequence. In a given network, there might be multiple CDU
matrices that operate with different widths, so they have different
durations and represent different periodic operations. It is recommended
that all CDU matrices in a 6TiSCH domain operate with the same cell
duration and are aligned so as to reduce the chances of interferences
from the Slotted ALOHA operations. The knowledge of the CDU matrices is
shared between all the nodes and used in particular to define
slotframes.[¶](#section-4.3.5-5){.pilcrow}

A slotframe is a MAC-level abstraction that is common to all nodes and
contains a series of timeslots of equal length and precedence. It is
characterized by a slotframe_ID and a slotframe_size. A slotframe aligns
to a CDU matrix for its parameters, such as number and duration of
timeslots.[¶](#section-4.3.5-6){.pilcrow}

Multiple slotframes can coexist in a node schedule, i.e., a node can
have multiple activities scheduled in different slotframes. A slotframe
is associated with a priority that may be related to the precedence of
different 6TiSCH topologies. The slotframes may be aligned to different
CDU matrices and thus have different widths. There is typically one
slotframe for scheduled traffic that has the highest precedence and one
or more slotframe(s) for RPL traffic. The timeslots in the slotframe are
indexed by the slotOffset; the first cell is at slotOffset
0.[¶](#section-4.3.5-7){.pilcrow}

When a packet is received from a higher layer for transmission, 6top
inserts that packet in the outgoing queue that matches the packet best
(Differentiated Services \[[RFC2474](#RFC2474){.xref}\] can therefore be
used). At each scheduled transmit slot, 6top looks for the frame in all
the outgoing queues that best matches the cells. If a frame is found, it
is given to the TSCH MAC for
transmission.[¶](#section-4.3.5-8){.pilcrow}

The 6TiSCH architecture envisions a protocol that enables chunk
ownership appropriation whereby a RPL parent discovers a chunk that is
not used in its interference domain, claims the chunk, and then defends
it in case another RPL parent would attempt to appropriate it while it
is in use. The chunk is the basic unit of ownership that is used in that
process.[¶](#section-4.3.6-3){.pilcrow}

As a result of the process of chunk ownership appropriation, the RPL
parent has exclusive authority to decide which cell in the appropriated
chunk can be used by which node in its interference domain. In other

### [4.4.](#section-4.4){.section-number .selfRef} [Schedule Management Mechanisms](#name-schedule-management-mechani){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-schedule-management-mechani}

6TiSCH uses four paradigms to manage the TSCH schedule of the LLN nodes:
Static Scheduling, Neighbor-to-Neighbor Scheduling, Remote Monitoring
and Scheduling Management, and Hop-by-Hop Scheduling. Multiple
mechanisms are defined that implement the associated Interaction Models,
and they can be combined and used in the same LLN. Which mechanism(s) to
use depends on application requirements.[¶](#section-4.4-1){.pilcrow}

#### [4.4.1.](#section-4.4.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Static Scheduling](#name-static-scheduling){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-static-scheduling}

In the simplest instantiation of a 6TiSCH network, a common fixed
schedule may be shared by all nodes in the network. Cells are shared,
and nodes contend for slot access in a Slotted ALOHA
manner.[¶](#section-4.4.1-1){.pilcrow}

A static TSCH schedule can be used to bootstrap a network, as an initial
phase during implementation or as a fall-back mechanism in case of
network malfunction. This schedule is preestablished, for instance,
decided by a network administrator based on operational needs. It can be
preconfigured into the nodes, or, more commonly, learned by a node when
joining the network using standard IEEE Std 802.15.4 Information
Elements (IE). Regardless, the schedule remains unchanged after the node
has joined a network. RPL is used on the resulting network. This
\"minimal\" scheduling mechanism that implements this paradigm is
detailed in
\[[RFC8180](#RFC8180){.xref}\].[¶](#section-4.4.1-2){.pilcrow}

In the simplest instantiation of a 6TiSCH network described in [Section
4.4.1](#mini){.xref}, nodes may expect a packet at any cell in the
schedule and will waste energy idle listening. In a more complex
instantiation of a 6TiSCH network, a matching portion of the schedule is
established between peers to reflect the observed amount of
transmissions between those nodes. The aggregation of the cells between
a node and a peer forms a bundle that the 6top sublayer uses to
implement the abstraction of a link for IP. The bandwidth on that link
is proportional to the number of cells in the
bundle.[¶](#section-4.4.2-1){.pilcrow}

If the size of a bundle is configured to fit an average amount of
bandwidth, peak traffic is dropped. If the size is configured to allow
for peak emissions, energy is wasted idle
listening.[¶](#section-4.4.2-2){.pilcrow}

As discussed in more detail in [Section 4.3](#s6Pprot){.xref}, the [6top
Protocol](#RFC8480){.xref} \[[RFC8480](#RFC8480){.xref}\] specifies the
exchanges between neighbor nodes to reserve soft cells to transmit to
one another, possibly under the control of a Scheduling Function (SF).
Because this reservation is done without global knowledge of the
schedule of the other nodes in the LLN, scheduling collisions are
possible.[¶](#section-4.4.2-3){.pilcrow}

And as discussed in [Section 4.3.2](#missf){.xref}, an optional SF is
used to monitor bandwidth usage and to perform requests for dynamic
allocation by the 6top sublayer. The SF component is not part of the
6top sublayer. It may be co-located on the same device or may be
partially or fully offloaded to an external system. The [\"6TiSCH
Minimal Scheduling Function (MSF)\"](#RFC9033){.xref}
\[[RFC9033](#RFC9033){.xref}\] provides a simple SF that can be used by
default by devices that support dynamic scheduling of soft
cells.[¶](#section-4.4.2-4){.pilcrow}

Monitoring and relocation is done in the 6top sublayer. For the upper
layer, the connection between two neighbor nodes appears as a number of
cells. Depending on traffic requirements, the upper layer can request
6top to add or delete a number of cells scheduled to a particular
neighbor, without being responsible for choosing the exact
slotOffset/channelOffset of those cells.[¶](#section-4.4.2-5){.pilcrow}

Remote Monitoring and Schedule Management refers to a DetNet/SDN model
whereby an NME and a scheduling entity, associated with a PCE, reside in
a central controller and interact with the 6top sublayer to control IPv6
links and Tracks ([Section 4.5](#ontrk){.xref}) in a 6TiSCH network. The
composite centralized controller can assign physical resources (e.g.,
buffers and hard cells) to a particular Track to optimize the
reliability within a bounded latency for a well-specified
flow.[¶](#section-4.4.3-1){.pilcrow}

The work in the 6TiSCH Working Group focused on nondeterministic traffic
and did not provide the generic data model necessary for the controller
to monitor and manage resources of the 6top sublayer. This is deferred
to future work, see [Appendix
A.1.2](#unchartered-tracks){.xref}.[¶](#section-4.4.3-2){.pilcrow}

With respect to centralized routing and scheduling, it is envisioned
that the related component of the 6TiSCH architecture would be an
extension of the [DetNet architecture](#RFC8655){.xref}
\[[RFC8655](#RFC8655){.xref}\], which studies Layer 3 aspects of
Deterministic Networks and covers networks that span multiple Layer 2
domains.[¶](#section-4.4.3-3){.pilcrow}

The DetNet architecture is a form of Software-Defined Networking (SDN)
architecture and is composed of three planes: a (User) Application
Plane, a Controller Plane (where the PCE operates), and a Network Plane,
which can represent a 6TiSCH LLN.[¶](#section-4.4.3-4){.pilcrow}

[\"Software-Defined Networking (SDN): Layers and Architecture

The PCE establishes end-to-end Tracks of hard cells, which are described
in more detail in [Section
4.6.1](#trkfwd){.xref}.[¶](#section-4.4.3-7){.pilcrow}

The DetNet work is expected to enable end-to-end deterministic paths
across heterogeneous networks. This can be, for instance, a 6TiSCH LLN
and an Ethernet backbone.[¶](#section-4.4.3-8){.pilcrow}

This model fits the 6TiSCH extended configuration, whereby a 6BBR
federates multiple 6TiSCH LLNs in a single subnet over a backbone that
can be, for instance, Ethernet or Wi-Fi. In that model, 6TiSCH 6BBRs
synchronize with one another over the backbone, so as to ensure that the
multiple LLNs that form the IPv6 subnet stay tightly
synchronized.[¶](#section-4.4.3-9){.pilcrow}

If the backbone is deterministic, then the Backbone Router ensures that
the end-to-end deterministic behavior is maintained between the LLN and
the backbone. It is the responsibility of the PCE to compute a
deterministic path end to end across the TSCH network and an IEEE Std
802.1 TSN Ethernet backbone, and it is the responsibility of DetNet to
enable end-to-end deterministic
forwarding.[¶](#section-4.4.3-10){.pilcrow}

A node can reserve a [Track](#ontrk){.xref} ([Section

The architecture introduces the concept of a Track, which is a directed
path from a source 6TiSCH node to one or more destination 6TiSCH node(s)
across a 6TiSCH LLN.[¶](#section-4.5-1){.pilcrow}

A Track is the 6TiSCH instantiation of the concept of a deterministic
path as described in \[[RFC8655](#RFC8655){.xref}\]. Constrained
resources such as memory buffers are reserved for that Track in
intermediate 6TiSCH nodes to avoid loss related to limited capacity. A
6TiSCH node along a Track not only knows which bundles of cells it
should use to receive packets from a previous hop but also knows which
bundle(s) it should use to send packets to its next hop along the
Track.[¶](#section-4.5-2){.pilcrow}

#### [4.5.1.](#section-4.5.1){.section-number .selfRef} [General Behavior of Tracks](#name-general-behavior-of-tracks){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-general-behavior-of-tracks}

A Track is associated with Layer 2 bundles of cells with related
schedules and logical relationships that ensure that a packet that is
injected in a Track will progress in due time all the way to
destination.[¶](#section-4.5.1-1){.pilcrow}

Multiple cells may be scheduled in a Track for the transmission of a
single packet, in which case the normal operation of IEEE Std 802.15.4
Automatic Repeat-reQuest (ARQ) can take place; the acknowledgment may be
omitted in some cases, for instance, if there is no scheduled cell for a
possible retry.[¶](#section-4.5.1-2){.pilcrow}

There are several benefits for using a Track to forward a packet from a
source node to the destination node:[¶](#section-4.5.1-3){.pilcrow}

1.  [Track Forwarding, as further described in [Section
    4.6.1](#trkfwd){.xref}, is a Layer 2 forwarding scheme, which
    introduces less process delay and overhead than a Layer 3 forwarding
    scheme. Therefore, LLN devices can save more energy and resources,
    which is critical for resource-constrained
    devices.[¶](#section-4.5.1-4.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.5.1-4.1}
2.  [Since channel resources, i.e., bundles of cells, have been reserved
    for communications between 6TiSCH nodes of each hop on the Track,
    the throughput and the maximum latency of the traffic along a Track
    are guaranteed, and the jitter is
    minimized.[¶](#section-4.5.1-4.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.5.1-4.2}
3.  [By knowing the scheduled timeslots of incoming bundle(s) and
    outgoing bundle(s), 6TiSCH nodes on a Track could save more energy
    by staying in sleep state during inactive
    slots.[¶](#section-4.5.1-4.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.5.1-4.3}
4.  [Tracks are protected from interfering with one another if a cell is
    scheduled to belong to at most one Track, and congestion loss is
    avoided if at most one packet can be presented to the MAC to use
    that cell. Tracks enhance the reliability of transmissions and thus
    further improve the energy consumption in LLN devices by reducing
    the chances of
    retransmission.[¶](#section-4.5.1-4.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.5.1-4.4}

A Serial (or simple) Track is the 6TiSCH version of a circuit: a bundle
of cells that are programmed to receive (RX-cells) is uniquely paired
with a bundle of cells that are set to transmit (TX-cells), representing
a Layer 2 forwarding state that can be used regardless of the
network-layer protocol. A Serial Track is thus formed end-to-end as a
succession of paired bundles: a receive bundle from the previous hop and
a transmit bundle to the next hop along the
Track.[¶](#section-4.5.2-1){.pilcrow}

For a given iteration of the device schedule, the effective channel of
the cell is obtained by looping through a well-known hopping sequence
beginning at Epoch time and starting at the cell\'s channelOffset, which
results in a rotation of the frequency that is used for transmission.
The bundles may be computed so as to accommodate both variable rates and
retransmissions, so they might not be fully used in the iteration of the
schedule.[¶](#section-4.5.2-2){.pilcrow}

The art of Deterministic Networks already includes packet replication
and elimination techniques. Example standards include the Parallel
Redundancy Protocol (PRP) and the High-availability Seamless Redundancy
(HSR) \[[IEC62439](#IEC62439){.xref}\]. Similarly, and as opposed to a
Serial Track that is a sequence of nodes and links, a Complex Track is
shaped as a directed acyclic graph towards one or more destination(s) to
support multipath forwarding and route around
failures.[¶](#section-4.5.3-1){.pilcrow}

A Complex Track may branch off over noncongruent branches for the
purpose of multicasting and/or redundancy, in which case, it reconverges
later down the path. This enables the Packet Replication, Elimination,
and Ordering Functions (PREOF) defined by DetNet. Packet ARQ,
Replication, Elimination, and Overhearing (PAREO) adds radio-specific
capabilities of Layer 2 ARQ and promiscuous listening to redundant
transmissions to compensate for the lossiness of the medium and meet
industrial expectations of a RAW network. Combining PAREO and PREOF, a
Track may extend beyond the 6TiSCH network into a larger DetNet
network.[¶](#section-4.5.3-2){.pilcrow}

In the art of TSCH, a path does not necessarily support PRE, but it is
almost systematically multipath. This means that a Track is scheduled so
as to ensure that each hop has at least two forwarding solutions, and
the forwarding decision is to try the preferred one and use the other in
case of Layer 2 transmission failure as detected by ARQ. Similarly, at
each 6TiSCH hop along the Track, the PCE may schedule more than one
timeslot for a packet, so as to support Layer 2 retries (ARQ). It is
also possible that the field device only uses the second branch if
sending over the first branch fails.[¶](#section-4.5.3-3){.pilcrow}

Ultimately, DetNet should enable extending a Track beyond the 6TiSCH LLN
as illustrated in [Figure 10](#elifig){.xref}. In that example, a Track
is laid out from a field device in a 6TiSCH network to an IoT gateway
that is located on an 802.1 Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) backbone. A
6TiSCH-aware DetNet service layer handles the Packet Replication,
Elimination, and Ordering Functions over the DODAG that forms a
Track.[¶](#section-4.5.4-1){.pilcrow}

The Replication function in the 6TiSCH Node sends a copy of each packet
over two different branches, and the PCE schedules each hop of both
branches so that the two copies arrive in due time at the gateway. In
case of a loss on one branch, hopefully the other copy of the packet
still makes it in due time. If two copies make it to the IoT gateway,
the Elimination function in the gateway ignores the extra packet and
presents only one copy to upper layers.[¶](#section-4.5.4-2){.pilcrow}

#### [4.5.5.](#section-4.5.5){.section-number .selfRef} [Cell Reuse](#name-cell-reuse){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-cell-reuse}

The 6TiSCH architecture provides the means to avoid waste of cells as
well as overflows in the transmit bundle of a Track, as
follows:[¶](#section-4.5.5-1){.pilcrow}

A TX-cell that is not needed for the current iteration may be reused
opportunistically on a per-hop basis for routed packets. When all of the
frames that were received for a given Track are effectively transmitted,
any available TX-cell for that Track can be reused for upper-layer
traffic for which the next-hop router matches the next hop along the
Track. In that case, the cell that is being used is effectively a
TX-cell from the Track, but the short address for the destination is
that of the next-hop router.[¶](#section-4.5.5-2){.pilcrow}

It results in a frame that is received in an RX-cell of a Track with a
destination MAC address set to this node, as opposed to the broadcast
MAC address that must be extracted from the Track and delivered to the
upper layer. Note that a frame with an unrecognized destination MAC
address is dropped at the lower MAC layer and thus is not received at
the 6top sublayer.[¶](#section-4.5.5-3){.pilcrow}

On the other hand, it might happen that there are not enough TX-cells in
the transmit bundle to accommodate the Track traffic, for instance, if
more retransmissions are needed than provisioned. In that case, and if
the frame transports an IPv6 packet, then it can be placed for
transmission in the bundle that is used for Layer 3 traffic towards the
next hop along the Track. The MAC address should be set to the next-hop
MAC address to avoid confusion.[¶](#section-4.5.5-4){.pilcrow}

It results in a frame that is received over a Layer 3 bundle that may be
in fact associated with a Track. In a classical IP link such as an
Ethernet, off-Track traffic is typically in excess over reservation to
be routed along the non-reserved path based on its QoS setting. But with
6TiSCH, since the use of the Layer 3 bundle may be due to transmission
failures, it makes sense for the receiver to recognize a frame that
should be re-Tracked and to place it back on the appropriate bundle if
possible. A frame is re-Tracked by scheduling it for transmission over
the transmit bundle associated with the Track, with the destination MAC
address set to broadcast.[¶](#section-4.5.5-5){.pilcrow}

#### [4.6.1.](#section-4.6.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Track Forwarding](#name-track-forwarding){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-track-forwarding}

Forwarding along a Track can be seen as a Generalized Multiprotocol
Label Switching (GMPLS) operation in that the information used to switch
a frame is not an explicit label but is rather related to other
properties of the way the packet was received, a particular cell in the
case of 6TiSCH. As a result, as long as the TSCH MAC (and Layer 2
security) accepts a frame, that frame can be switched regardless of the
protocol, whether this is an IPv6 packet, a 6LoWPAN fragment, or a frame
from an alternate protocol such as WirelessHART or
ISA100.11a.[¶](#section-4.6.1-1){.pilcrow}

A data frame that is forwarded along a Track normally has a destination
MAC address that is set to broadcast or a multicast address depending on
MAC support. This way, the MAC layer in the intermediate nodes accepts
the incoming frame and 6top switches it without incurring a change in
the MAC header. In the case of IEEE Std 802.15.4, this means effectively
to broadcast, so that along the Track the short address for the
destination of the frame is set to
0xFFFF.[¶](#section-4.6.1-2){.pilcrow}

There are two modes for a Track: an IPv6 native mode and a
protocol-independent tunnel mode.[¶](#section-4.6.1-3){.pilcrow}

##### [4.6.1.1.](#section-4.6.1.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Native Mode](#name-native-mode){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-native-mode}

In native mode, the Protocol Data Unit (PDU) is associated with
flow-dependent metadata that refers uniquely to the Track, so the 6top
sublayer can place the frame in the appropriate cell without ambiguity.
In the case of IPv6 traffic, this flow may be identified using a 6-tuple
as discussed in \[[RFC8939](#RFC8939){.xref}\]. In particular,
implementations of this document should support identification of DetNet
flows based on the IPv6 Flow Label
field.[¶](#section-4.6.1.1-1){.pilcrow}

The flow follows a Track that is identified using a RPL Instance (see
[Section
3.1.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6550#section-3.1.3){.relref} of
\[[RFC6550](#RFC6550){.xref}\]), signaled in a RPL Packet Information
(more in [Section
11.2.2.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6550#section-11.2.2.1){.relref}
of \[[RFC6550](#RFC6550){.xref}\]) and the source address of a packet
going down the DODAG formed by a local instance. One or more flows may
be placed in a same Track and the Track identification (TrackID plus
owner) may be placed in an IP-in-IP encapsulation. The forwarding
operation is based on the Track and does not depend on the flow
therein.[¶](#section-4.6.1.1-2){.pilcrow}

The Track identification is validated at egress before restoring the
destination MAC address (DMAC) and punting to the upper
layer.[¶](#section-4.6.1.1-3){.pilcrow}

[Figure 11](#fig6t){.xref} illustrates the Track Forwarding operation
that happens at the 6top sublayer, below
IP.[¶](#section-4.6.1.1-4){.pilcrow}

In tunnel mode, the frames originate from an arbitrary protocol over a
compatible MAC that may or may not be synchronized with the 6TiSCH
network. An example of this would be a router with a dual radio that is
capable of receiving and sending WirelessHART or ISA100.11a frames with
the second radio by presenting itself as an access point or a Backbone
Router, respectively. In that mode, some entity (e.g., PCE) can
coordinate with a WirelessHART Network Manager or an ISA100.11a System
Manager to specify the flows that are
transported.[¶](#section-4.6.1.2-1){.pilcrow}

In that case, the TrackID that identifies the Track at the ingress
6TiSCH router is derived from the RX-cell. The DMAC is set to this node,
but the TrackID indicates that the frame must be tunneled over a
particular Track, so the frame is not passed to the upper layer.
Instead, the DMAC is forced to broadcast, and the frame is passed to the
6top sublayer for switching.[¶](#section-4.6.1.2-3){.pilcrow}

At the egress 6TiSCH router, the reverse operation occurs. Based on
tunneling information of the Track, which may for instance indicate that
the tunneled datagram is an IP packet, the datagram is passed to the
appropriate link-layer with the destination MAC
restored.[¶](#section-4.6.1.2-4){.pilcrow}

##### [4.6.1.3.](#section-4.6.1.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Tunneling Information](#name-tunneling-information){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-tunneling-information}

Tunneling information coming with the Track configuration provides the
destination MAC address of the egress endpoint as well as the tunnel
mode and specific data depending on the mode, for instance, a service
access point for frame delivery at
egress.[¶](#section-4.6.1.3-1){.pilcrow}

If the tunnel egress point does not have a MAC address that matches the
configuration, the Track installation
fails.[¶](#section-4.6.1.3-2){.pilcrow}

If the Layer 3 destination address belongs to the tunnel termination,
then it is possible that the IPv6 address of the destination is
compressed at the 6LoWPAN sublayer based on the MAC address. Restoring
the wrong MAC address at the egress would then also result in the wrong
IP address in the packet after decompression. For that reason, a packet
can be injected in a Track only if the destination MAC address is
effectively that of the tunnel egress point. It is thus mandatory for
the ingress router to validate that the MAC address used at the 6LoWPAN
sublayer for compression matches that of the tunnel egress point before
it overwrites it to broadcast. The 6top sublayer at the tunnel egress
point reverts that operation to the MAC address obtained from the tunnel
information.[¶](#section-4.6.1.3-3){.pilcrow}

Considering that, per [Section
4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4944#section-4){.relref} of
\[[RFC4944](#RFC4944){.xref}\], 6LoWPAN packets can be as large as 1280
bytes (the IPv6 minimum MTU) and that the non-storing mode of RPL
implies source routing, which requires space for routing headers, and
that an IEEE Std 802.15.4 frame with security may carry in the order of
80 bytes of effective payload, an IPv6 packet might be fragmented into
more than 16 fragments at the 6LoWPAN
sublayer.[¶](#section-4.6.3-1){.pilcrow}

This level of fragmentation is much higher than that traditionally
experienced over the Internet with IPv4 fragments, where fragmentation
is already known as harmful.[¶](#section-4.6.3-2){.pilcrow}

In the case of a multihop route within a 6TiSCH network, hop-by-hop
recomposition occurs at each hop to reform the packet and route it. This
creates additional latency and forces intermediate nodes to store a
portion of a packet for an undetermined time, thus impacting critical
resources such as memory and battery.[¶](#section-4.6.3-3){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC8930](#RFC8930){.xref}\] describes a framework for forwarding
fragments end-to-end across a 6TiSCH route-over mesh. Within that
framework,
\[[VIRTUAL-REASSEMBLY](#I-D.ietf-lwig-6lowpan-virtual-reassembly){.xref}\]
details a virtual reassembly buffer mechanism whereby the datagram tag
in the 6LoWPAN fragment is used as a label for switching at the 6LoWPAN
sublayer.[¶](#section-4.6.3-4){.pilcrow}

Building on this technique, \[[RFC8931](#RFC8931){.xref}\] introduces a
new format for 6LoWPAN fragments that enables the selective recovery of
individual fragments and allows for a degree of flow control based on an
Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN).[¶](#section-4.6.3-5){.pilcrow}

6TiSCH supports the PREOF operations of elimination and reordering of
packets along a complex Track, but has no requirement about tagging a
sequence number in the packet for that purpose. With 6TiSCH, the
schedule can tell when multiple receive timeslots correspond to copies
of a same packet, in which case the receiver may avoid listening to the
extra copies once it has received one instance of the
packet.[¶](#section-4.7.2-1){.pilcrow}

The semantics of the configuration enable correlated timeslots to be
grouped for transmit (and receive, respectively) with \'OR\' relations,
and then an \'AND\' relation can be configurable between groups. The
semantics are such that if the transmit (and receive, respectively)
operation succeeded in one timeslot in an \'OR\' group, then all the
other timeslots in the group are ignored. Now, if there are at least two
groups, the \'AND\' relation between the groups indicates that one
operation must succeed in each of the
groups.[¶](#section-4.7.2-2){.pilcrow}

On the transmit side, timeslots provisioned for retries along a same
branch of a Track are placed in the same \'OR\' group. The \'OR\'
relation indicates that if a transmission is acknowledged, then
retransmissions of that packet should not be attempted for the remaining
timeslots in that group. There are as many \'OR\' groups as there are
branches of the Track departing from this node. Different \'OR\' groups
are programmed for the purpose of replication, each group corresponding
to one branch of the Track. The \'AND\' relation between the groups
indicates that transmission over any of branches must be attempted
regardless of whether a transmission succeeded in another branch. It is
also possible to place cells to different next-hop routers in the same
\'OR\' group. This allows routing along multipath Tracks, trying one
next hop and then another only if sending to the first
fails.[¶](#section-4.7.2-3){.pilcrow}

On the receive side, all timeslots are programmed in the same \'OR\'
group. Retries of the same copy as well as converging branches for
elimination are converged, meaning that the first successful reception
is enough and that all the other timeslots can be ignored. An \'AND\'
group denotes different packets that must all be received and
transmitted over the associated transmit groups within their respected
\'AND\' or \'OR\' rules.[¶](#section-4.7.2-4){.pilcrow}

### [6.1.](#section-6.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Availability of Remote Services](#name-availability-of-remote-serv){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-availability-of-remote-serv}

The operation of 6TiSCH Tracks inherits its high-level operation from
DetNet and is subject to the observations in [Section
5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8655#section-5){.relref} of
\[[RFC8655](#RFC8655){.xref}\]. The installation and the maintenance of
the 6TiSCH Tracks depend on the availability of a controller with a PCE
to compute and push them in the network. When that connectivity is lost,
existing Tracks may continue to operate until the end of their lifetime,
but cannot be removed or updated, and new Tracks cannot be
installed.[¶](#section-6.1-1){.pilcrow}

In an LLN, the communication with a remote PCE may be slow and
unreactive to rapid changes in the condition of the wireless
communication. An attacker may introduce extra delay by selectively
jamming some packets or some flows. The expectation is that the 6TiSCH
Tracks enable enough redundancy to maintain the critical traffic in
operation while new routes are calculated and programmed into the
network.[¶](#section-6.1-2){.pilcrow}

As with DetNet in general, the communication with the PCE must be
secured and should be protected against DoS attacks, including delay
injection and blackholing attacks, and secured as discussed in the
security considerations defined for Abstraction and Control of Traffic
Engineered Networks (ACTN) in [Section
9](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8453#section-9){.relref} of
\[[RFC8453](#RFC8453){.xref}\], which applies equally to DetNet and
6TiSCH. In a similar manner, the communication with the JRC must be
secured and should be protected against DoS attacks when
possible.[¶](#section-6.1-3){.pilcrow}

### [6.2.](#section-6.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Selective Jamming](#name-selective-jamming){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-selective-jamming}

The hopping sequence of a TSCH network is well known, meaning that if a
rogue manages to identify a cell of a particular flow, then it may
selectively jam that cell without impacting any other traffic. This
attack can be performed at the PHY layer without any knowledge of the
Layer 2 keys, and it is very hard to detect and diagnose because only
one flow is impacted.[¶](#section-6.2-1){.pilcrow}

\[[ROBUST-SCHEDULING](#I-D.tiloca-6tisch-robust-scheduling){.xref}\]

to perpetrate that particular attack.[¶](#section-6.2-2){.pilcrow}

### [6.3.](#section-6.3){.section-number .selfRef} [MAC-Layer Security](#name-mac-layer-security){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-mac-layer-security}

This architecture operates on IEEE Std 802.15.4 and expects the
link-layer security to be enabled at all times between connected
devices, except for the very first step of the device join process,
where a joining device may need some initial, unsecured exchanges so as
to obtain its initial key material. In a typical deployment, all joined
nodes use the same keys, and rekeying needs to be
global.[¶](#section-6.3-1){.pilcrow}

The 6TISCH architecture relies on the join process to deny authorization
of invalid nodes and to preserve the integrity of the network keys. A
rogue that managed to access the network can perform a large variety of
attacks from DoS to injecting forged packets and routing information.
\"Zero-trust\" properties would be highly desirable but are mostly not
available at the time of this writing. \[[RFC8928](#RFC8928){.xref}\] is
a notable exception that protects the ownership of IPv6 addresses and
prevents a rogue node with L2 access from stealing and injecting traffic
on behalf of a legitimate node.[¶](#section-6.3-2){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-6.4 .section}
### [6.4.](#section-6.4){.section-number .selfRef} [Time Synchronization](#name-time-synchronization){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-time-synchronization}

Time synchronization in TSCH induces another event horizon whereby a
node will only communicate with another node if they are synchronized
within a guard time. The pledge discovers the synchronization of the
network based on the time of reception of the beacon. If an attacker
synchronizes a pledge outside of the guard time of the legitimate nodes,
then the pledge will never see a legitimate beacon and may not discover
the attack.[¶](#section-6.4-1){.pilcrow}

As discussed in \[[RFC8655](#RFC8655){.xref}\], measures must be taken
to protect the time synchronization, and for 6TiSCH this includes
ensuring that the Absolute Slot Number (ASN), which is the node\'s sense
of time, is not compromised. Once installed and as long as the node is
synchronized to the network, ASN is implicit in the
transmissions.[¶](#section-6.4-2){.pilcrow}

[IEEE Std 802.15.4](#IEEE802154){.xref}
\[[IEEE802154](#IEEE802154){.xref}\] specifies that in a TSCH network,
the nonce that is used for the computation of the Message Integrity Code
(MIC) to secure link-layer frames is composed of the address of the
source of the frame and of the ASN. The standard assumes that the ASN is
distributed securely by other means. The ASN is not passed explicitly in
the data frames and does not constitute a complete anti-replay
protection. As a result, upper-layer protocols must provide a way to
detect duplicates and cope with them.[¶](#section-6.4-3){.pilcrow}

If the receiver and the sender have a different sense of ASN, the MIC
will not validate and the frame will be dropped. In that sense, TSCH
induces an event horizon whereby only nodes that have a common sense of
ASN can talk to one another in an authenticated manner. With 6TiSCH, the
pledge discovers a tentative ASN in beacons from nodes that have already
joined the network. But even if the beacon can be authenticated, the ASN
cannot be trusted as it could be a replay by an attacker, announcing an
ASN that represents a time in the past. If the pledge uses an ASN that
is learned from a replayed beacon for an encrypted transmission, a
nonce-reuse attack becomes possible, and the network keys may be
compromised.[¶](#section-6.4-4){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-6.5 .section}
### [6.5.](#section-6.5){.section-number .selfRef} [Validating ASN](#name-validating-asn){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-validating-asn}

After obtaining the tentative ASN, a pledge that wishes to join the
6TiSCH network must use a join protocol to obtain its security keys. The
join protocol used in 6TiSCH is the Constrained Join Protocol (CoJP). In
the minimal setting defined in \[[RFC9031](#RFC9031){.xref}\], the
authentication requires a pre-shared key, based on which a secure
session is derived. The CoJP exchange may also be preceded by a
zero-touch handshake
\[[ZEROTOUCH-JOIN](#I-D.ietf-6tisch-dtsecurity-zerotouch-join){.xref}\]
in order to enable pledge joining based on certificates and/or
inter-domain communication.[¶](#section-6.5-1){.pilcrow}

As detailed in [Section 4.2.1](#rflo){.xref}, a Join Proxy (JP) helps
the pledge with the join procedure by relaying the link-scope Join
Request over the IP network to a Join Registrar/Coordinator (JRC) that
can authenticate the pledge and validate that it is attached to the
appropriate network. As a result of the CoJP exchange, the pledge is in
possession of link-layer material including keys and a short address,
and if the ASN is known to be correct, all traffic can now be secured
using CCM\* \[[CCMstar](#CCMstar){.xref}\] at the link
layer.[¶](#section-6.5-2){.pilcrow}

The authentication steps must be such that they cannot be replayed by an
attacker, and they must not depend on the tentative ASN being valid.
During the authentication, the keying material that the pledge obtains
from the JRC does not provide protection against spoofed ASN. Once the
pledge has obtained the keys to use in the network, it may still need to
verify the ASN. If the nonce used in the Layer 2 security derives from
the extended (MAC-64) address, then replaying the ASN alone cannot
enable a nonce-reuse attack unless the same node has lost its state with
a previous ASN. But if the nonce derives from the short address (e.g.,
assigned by the JRC), then the JRC must ensure that it never assigns
short addresses that were already given to this or other nodes with the
same keys. In other words, the network must be rekeyed before the JRC
runs out of short addresses.[¶](#section-6.5-3){.pilcrow}

[Section 4.2.1](#rflo){.xref} provides an overview of the CoJP process
described in \[[RFC9031](#RFC9031){.xref}\] by which an LLN can be
assembled in the field, having been provisioned in a lab.
\[[ZEROTOUCH-JOIN](#I-D.ietf-6tisch-dtsecurity-zerotouch-join){.xref}\]
is future work that precedes and then leverages CoJP using the
\[[CONSTRAINED-VOUCHER](#I-D.ietf-anima-constrained-voucher){.xref}\]
constrained profile of \[[RFC8995](#RFC8995){.xref}\]. This later work
requires a yet-to-be standardized Lightweight Authenticated Key Exchange
protocol.[¶](#section-6.6-1){.pilcrow}

CoJP results in distribution of a network-wide key that is to be used
with \[[IEEE802154](#IEEE802154){.xref}\] security. The details of use
are described in \[[RFC9031](#RFC9031){.xref}\], Sections
[9.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9031#section-9.2){.relref} and
[9.3.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9031#section-9.3.2){.relref}.[¶](#section-6.6-2){.pilcrow}

The BRSKI mechanism may lead to the use of CoJP, in which case it also
results in distribution of a network-wide key. Alternatively the BRSKI
mechanism may be followed by use of
\[[EST-COAPS](#I-D.ietf-ace-coap-est){.xref}\] to enroll certificates
for each device. In that case, the certificates may be used with an
\[[IEEE802154](#IEEE802154){.xref}\] key agreement protocol. The
description of this mechanism, while conceptually straightforward, still
has significant standardization hurdles to
pass.[¶](#section-6.6-3){.pilcrow}

[Section
8.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9031#section-8.2){.relref} of
\[[RFC9031](#RFC9031){.xref}\] describes a mechanism to change (rekey)
the network. There are a number of reasons to initiate a network rekey:
to remove unwanted (corrupt/malicious) nodes, to recover unused 2-byte
short addresses, or due to limits in encryption algorithms. For all of
the mechanisms that distribute a network-wide key, rekeying is also
needed on a periodic basis. In more detail:[¶](#section-6.6-4){.pilcrow}

-   [The mechanism described in [Section
    8.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9031#section-8.2){.relref} of
    \[[RFC9031](#RFC9031){.xref}\] requires advance communication
    between the JRC and every one of the nodes before the key change.
    Given that many nodes may be sleepy, this operation may take a
    significant amount of time and may consume a significant portion of
    the available bandwidth. As such, network-wide rekeys to exclude
    nodes that have become malicious will not be particularly quick. If
    a rekey is already in progress, but the unwanted node has not yet
    been updated, then it is possible to just continue the operation. If
    the unwanted node has already received the update, then the rekey
    operation will need to be
    restarted.[¶](#section-6.6-5.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.6-5.1}
-   [The cryptographic mechanisms used by IEEE Std 802.15.4 include the
    2-byte short address in the calculation of the context. A
    nonce-reuse attack may become feasible if a short address is
    reassigned to another node while the same network-wide keys are in
    operation. A network that gains and loses nodes on a regular basis
    is likely to reach the 65536 limit of the 2-byte (16-bit) short
    addresses, even if the network has only a few thousand nodes.
    Network planners should consider the need to rekey the network on a
    periodic basis in order to recover 2-byte addresses. The rekey can
    update the short addresses for active nodes if desired, but there is
    actually no need to do this as long as the key has been
    changed.[¶](#section-6.6-5.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.6-5.2}
-   [With TSCH as it stands at the time of this writing, the ASN will
    wrap after 2\^40 timeslot durations, meaning around 350 years with
    the default values. Wrapping ASN is not expected to happen within
    the lifetime of most LLNs. Yet, should the ASN wrap, the network
    must be rekeyed to avoid a nonce-reuse
    attack.[¶](#section-6.6-5.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.6-5.3}
-   [Many cipher algorithms have some suggested limits on how many bytes
    should be encrypted with that algorithm before a new key is used.
    These numbers are typically in the many to hundreds of gigabytes of
    data. On very fast backbone networks, this becomes an important
    concern. On LLNs with typical data rates in the kilobits/second,
    this concern is significantly less. With IEEE Std 802.15.4 as it
    stands at the time of this writing, the ASN will wrap before the
    limits of the current L2 crypto (AES-CCM-128) are reached, so the
    problem should never
    occur.[¶](#section-6.6-5.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.6-5.4}
-   [In any fashion, if the LLN is expected to operate continuously for
    decades, then the operators are advised to plan for the need to
    rekey.[¶](#section-6.6-5.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.6-5.5}

Except for urgent rekeys caused by malicious nodes, the rekey operation
described in \[[RFC9031](#RFC9031){.xref}\] can be done as a background
task and can be done incrementally. It is a make-before-break mechanism.
The switch over to the new key is not signaled by time, but rather by
observation that the new key is in use. As such, the update can take as
long as needed, or occur in as short a time as
practical.[¶](#section-6.6-6){.pilcrow}

intent was to publish when the WG concluded on the covered items. At the
time of publishing, the following specifications are still in progress

The security model and in particular the zero-touch join process

\[[ANIMA](#ANIMA){.xref}\] \"[Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key

\[[RFC8995](#RFC8995){.xref}\] to enable zero-touch security
provisioning; for highly constrained nodes, a minimal model based on
pre-shared keys (PSK) is also available. As currently written, it also
depends on a number of documents in progress in the CORE (Constrained
RESTful Environments) WG and on [\"Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman Over COSE

ROLL (Routing Over Low power and Lossy networks) is now standardizing a
reactive routing protocol based on RPL
\[[AODV-RPL](#I-D.ietf-roll-aodv-rpl){.xref}\]. The need of a reactive
routing protocol to establish on-demand, constraint-optimized routes and
a reservation protocol to establish Layer 3 Tracks is being discussed in
6TiSCH but not yet chartered.[¶](#section-a.1.2-1){.pilcrow}

At the time of this writing, there is new work planned in the IETF to
provide limited deterministic networking capabilities for wireless
networks with a focus on forwarding behaviors to react quickly and
locally to the changes as described in
\[[RAW-ARCHITECTURE](#I-D.pthubert-raw-architecture){.xref}\].[¶](#section-a.1.2-2){.pilcrow}

ROLL is also standardizing an extension to RPL to set up centrally
computed routes
\[[DAO-PROJECTION](#I-D.ietf-roll-dao-projection){.xref}\].[¶](#section-a.1.2-3){.pilcrow}

The 6TiSCH architecture should thus inherit from the [DetNet
architecture](#RFC8655){.xref} \[[RFC8655](#RFC8655){.xref}\] and thus
depends on it. The PCE should be a core component of that architecture.
An extension to RPL or to TEAS (Traffic Engineering Architecture and
Signaling) \[[TEAS](#TEAS){.xref}\] will be required to expose the
6TiSCH node capabilities and the network peers to the PCE, possibly in
combination with \[[RPL-MOP](#I-D.ietf-roll-capabilities){.xref}\]. A
protocol such as a lightweight Path Computation Element Communication
Protocol (PCEP) or an adaptation of Common Control and Measurement Plane
(CCAMP) \[[CCAMP](#CCAMP){.xref}\] GMPLS formats and procedures could be
used in combination to
\[[DAO-PROJECTION](#I-D.ietf-roll-dao-projection){.xref}\] to install
the Tracks, as computed by the PCE, to the 6TiSCH
nodes.[¶](#section-a.1.2-4){.pilcrow}

method to compress both the data-plane packets and the routing tables in

\[[RPL-BIER](#I-D.thubert-roll-bier){.xref}\].[¶](#section-a.1.3-1){.pilcrow}

BIER could also be used in the context of the DetNet service layer.

\[[TE-PREF](#I-D.thubert-bier-replication-elimination){.xref}\]

The current charter positions 6TiSCH on IEEE Std 802.15.4 only. Though
most of the design should be portable to other link types, 6TiSCH has a
strong dependency on IEEE Std 802.15.4 and its evolution. The impact of
changes to TSCH on this architecture should be minimal to nonexistent,
but deeper work such as 6top and security may be impacted. A 6TiSCH
Interest Group at the IEEE maintains the synchronization and helps
foster work at the IEEE should 6TiSCH demand
it.[¶](#section-a.2-1){.pilcrow}

Work is being proposed at IEEE (802.15.12 PAR) for an LLC that would
logically include the 6top sublayer. The interaction with the 6top
sublayer and the Scheduling Functions described in this document are yet
to be defined.[¶](#section-a.2-2){.pilcrow}

ISA100 \[[ISA100](#ISA100){.xref}\] Common Network Management (CNM) is
another external work of interest for 6TiSCH. The group, referred to as
ISA100.20, defines a Common Network Management framework that should
enable the management of resources that are controlled by heterogeneous
protocols such as ISA100.11a \[[ISA100.11a](#ISA100.11a){.xref}\],
WirelessHART \[[WirelessHART](#WirelessHART){.xref}\], and 6TiSCH.
Interestingly, the establishment of 6TiSCH deterministic paths, called
Tracks, are also in scope, and ISA100.20 is working on requirements for
DetNet.[¶](#section-a.2-3){.pilcrow}
