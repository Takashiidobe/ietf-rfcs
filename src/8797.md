The RPC-over-RDMA version 1 transport protocol
\[[RFC8166](#RFC8166){.xref}\] enables payload data transfer using
Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) for upper-layer protocols based on
Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) \[[RFC5531](#RFC5531){.xref}\]. The terms
\"Remote Direct Memory Access\" (RDMA) and \"Direct Data Placement\"
(DDP) are introduced in
\[[RFC5040](#RFC5040){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

The two most immediate shortcomings of RPC-over-RDMA version 1 are as
follows:[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

1.  ::: {#section-1-3.1}
    Setting up an RDMA data transfer (via RDMA Read or Write) can be
    costly. The small default size of messages transmitted using RDMA
    Send forces the use of RDMA Read or Write operations even for
    relatively small messages and data
    payloads.[¶](#section-1-3.1.1){.pilcrow}

    The original specification of RPC-over-RDMA version 1 provided an
    out-of-band protocol for passing inline threshold values between
    connected peers \[[RFC5666](#RFC5666){.xref}\]. However,
    \[[RFC8166](#RFC8166){.xref}\] eliminated support for this protocol,
    making it unavailable for this
    purpose.[¶](#section-1-3.1.2){.pilcrow}
    :::

2.  [Unlike most other contemporary RDMA-enabled storage protocols,
    there is no facility in RPC-over-RDMA version 1 that enables the use
    of remote invalidation
    \[[RFC5042](#RFC5042){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-3.2}

Each RPC-over-RDMA version 1 Transport Header follows the External Data
Representation (XDR) definition \[[RFC4506](#RFC4506){.xref}\] specified
in \[[RFC8166](#RFC8166){.xref}\]. However, RPC-over-RDMA version 1 has
no means of extending this definition in such a way that
interoperability with existing implementations is preserved. As a
result, an out-of-band mechanism is needed to help relieve these
constraints for existing RPC-over-RDMA version 1
implementations.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

This document specifies a simple, non-XDR-based message format designed
to be passed between RPC-over-RDMA version 1 peers at the time each RDMA
transport connection is first established. The mechanism assumes that
the underlying RDMA transport has a Private Data field that is passed
between peers at connection time, such as is present in the Marker PDU
Aligned Framing (MPA) protocol (described in [Section
7.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5044#section-7.1){.relref} of
\[[RFC5044](#RFC5044){.xref}\] and extended in
\[[RFC6581](#RFC6581){.xref}\]) or the InfiniBand Connection Manager
\[[IBA](#IBA){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}

To enable current RPC-over-RDMA version 1 implementations to
interoperate with implementations that support the message format
described in this document, implementation of the Private Data exchange
is [OPTIONAL]{.bcp14}. When Private Data has been successfully
exchanged, peers may choose to perform extended RDMA semantics. However,
this exchange does not alter the XDR definition specified in
\[[RFC8166](#RFC8166){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-6){.pilcrow}

The message format is intended to be further extensible within the
normal scope of such IETF work (see [Section
6](#section_96A18D5A-2AE4-490D-B140-B964302BF1DF){.xref} for further
details). [Section
8](#section_8701C122-F206-4F87-8FA6-62F1CD648A14){.xref} of this
document defines an IANA registry for this purpose. In addition,
interoperation between implementations of RPC-over-RDMA version 1 that
present this message format to peers and those that do not recognize
this message format is guaranteed.[¶](#section-1-7){.pilcrow}

### [3.1.](#section-3.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Inline Threshold Size](#name-inline-threshold-size){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-inline-threshold-size}

[Section
3.3.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8166#section-3.3.2){.relref} of
\[[RFC8166](#RFC8166){.xref}\] defines the term \"inline threshold\". An
inline threshold is the maximum number of bytes that can be transmitted
using one RDMA Send and one RDMA Receive. There are a pair of inline
thresholds for a connection: a client-to-server threshold and a
server-to-client threshold.[¶](#section-3.1-1){.pilcrow}

If an incoming RDMA message exceeds the size of a receiver\'s inline
threshold, the Receive operation fails and the RDMA provider typically
terminates the connection. To convey an RPC message larger than the
receiver\'s inline threshold without risking receive failure, a sender
must use explicit RDMA data transfer operations, which are more
expensive than an RDMA Send. See
Sections [3.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8166#section-3.3){.relref}
and [3.5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8166#section-3.5){.relref}
of \[[RFC8166](#RFC8166){.xref}\] for a complete
discussion.[¶](#section-3.1-2){.pilcrow}

The default value of inline thresholds for RPC-over-RDMA version 1
connections is 1024 bytes (as defined in [Section
3.3.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8166#section-3.3.3){.relref} of
\[[RFC8166](#RFC8166){.xref}\]). This value is adequate for nearly all
NFS version 3 procedures.[¶](#section-3.1-3){.pilcrow}

NFS version 4 COMPOUND operations \[[RFC7530](#RFC7530){.xref}\] are
larger on average than NFS version 3 procedures
\[[RFC1813](#RFC1813){.xref}\], forcing clients to use explicit RDMA
operations for frequently issued requests such as LOOKUP and GETATTR.
The use of RPCSEC_GSS security also increases the average size of RPC
messages, due to the larger size of RPCSEC_GSS credential material
included in RPC headers
\[[RFC7861](#RFC7861){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3.1-4){.pilcrow}

If a sender and receiver could somehow agree on larger inline
thresholds, frequently used RPC transactions avoid the cost of explicit
RDMA operations.[¶](#section-3.1-5){.pilcrow}

### [3.2.](#section-3.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Remote Invalidation](#name-remote-invalidation){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-remote-invalidation}

After an RDMA data transfer operation completes, an RDMA consumer can
request that its peer\'s RDMA Network Interface Card (RNIC) invalidate
the Steering Tag (STag) associated with the data transfer
\[[RFC5042](#RFC5042){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3.2-1){.pilcrow}

An RDMA consumer requests remote invalidation by posting an RDMA Send
with Invalidate operation in place of an RDMA Send operation. Each RDMA
Send with Invalidate carries one STag to invalidate. The receiver of an
RDMA Send with Invalidate performs the requested invalidation and then
reports that invalidation as part of the completion of a waiting Receive
operation.[¶](#section-3.2-2){.pilcrow}

If both peers support remote invalidation, an RPC-over-RDMA responder
might use remote invalidation when replying to an RPC request that
provided chunks. Because one of the chunks has already been invalidated,
finalizing the results of the RPC is made simpler and
faster.[¶](#section-3.2-3){.pilcrow}

However, there are some important caveats that contraindicate the
blanket use of remote invalidation:[¶](#section-3.2-4){.pilcrow}

-   [Remote invalidation is not supported by all
    RNICs.[¶](#section-3.2-5.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.2-5.1}
-   [Not all RPC-over-RDMA responder implementations can generate RDMA
    Send with Invalidate
    operations.[¶](#section-3.2-5.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.2-5.2}
-   [Not all RPC-over-RDMA requester implementations can recognize when
    remote invalidation has
    occurred.[¶](#section-3.2-5.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.2-5.3}
-   [On one connection in different RPC-over-RDMA transactions, or in a
    single RPC-over-RDMA transaction, an RPC-over-RDMA requester can
    expose a mixture of STags that may be invalidated remotely and some
    that must not be. No indication is provided at the RDMA layer as to
    which is which.[¶](#section-3.2-5.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.2-5.4}

A responder therefore must not employ remote invalidation unless it is
aware of support for it in its own RDMA stack, and on the requester.
And, without altering the XDR structure of RPC-over-RDMA version 1
messages, it is not possible to support remote invalidation with
requesters that include an STag that must not be invalidated remotely in
an RPC with STags that may be invalidated. Likewise, it is not possible
to support remote invalidation with requesters that mix RPCs with STags
that may be invalidated with RPCs with STags that must not be
invalidated on the same connection.[¶](#section-3.2-6){.pilcrow}

There are some NFS/RDMA client implementations whose STags are always
safe to invalidate remotely. For such clients, indicating to the
responder that remote invalidation is always safe can enable such
invalidation without the need for additional protocol elements to be
defined.[¶](#section-3.2-7){.pilcrow}

## [4.](#section-4){.section-number .selfRef} [Private Data Message Format](#name-private-data-message-format){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-private-data-message-format}

With an InfiniBand lower layer, for example, RDMA connection setup uses
a Connection Manager (CM) when establishing a Reliable Connection
\[[IBA](#IBA){.xref}\]. When an RPC-over-RDMA version 1 transport
connection is established, the client (which actively establishes
connections) and the server (which passively accepts connections)
populate the CM Private Data field exchanged as part of CM connection
establishment.[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

The transport properties exchanged via this mechanism are fixed for the
life of the connection. Each new connection presents an opportunity for
a fresh exchange. An implementation of the extension described in this
document [MUST]{.bcp14} be prepared for the settings to change upon a
reconnection.[¶](#section-4-2){.pilcrow}

For RPC-over-RDMA version 1, the CM Private Data field is formatted as
described below. RPC clients and servers use the same format. If the
capacity of the Private Data field is too small to contain this message
format or the underlying RDMA transport is not managed by a CM, the CM
Private Data field cannot be used on behalf of RPC-over-RDMA version
1.[¶](#section-4-3){.pilcrow}

The first eight octets of the CM Private Data field are to be formatted
as follows:[¶](#section-4-4){.pilcrow}

### [4.2.](#section-4.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Send and Receive Size Values](#name-send-and-receive-size-value){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-send-and-receive-size-value}

Inline threshold sizes from 1024 to 262144 octets can be represented in
the Send Size and Receive Size fields. The inline threshold values
provide a pair of 1024-octet-aligned maximum message lengths that
guarantee that Send and Receive operations do not fail due to length
errors.[¶](#section-4.2-1){.pilcrow}

The minimum inline threshold for RPC-over-RDMA version 1 is 1024 octets
(see [Section
3.3.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8166#section-3.3.3){.relref} of
\[[RFC8166](#RFC8166){.xref}\]). The values in the Send Size and Receive
Size fields represent the unsigned number of additional kilo-octets of
length beyond the first 1024 octets. Thus, a sender computes the encoded
value by dividing its actual buffer size, in octets, by 1024 and
subtracting one from the result. A receiver decodes an incoming Size
value by performing the inverse set of operations: it adds one to the
encoded value and then multiplies that result by
1024.[¶](#section-4.2-2){.pilcrow}

The client uses the smaller of its own send size and the server\'s
reported receive size as the client-to-server inline threshold. The
server uses the smaller of its own send size and the client\'s reported
receive size as the server-to-client inline
threshold.[¶](#section-4.2-3){.pilcrow}

## [5.](#section-5){.section-number .selfRef} [Interoperability Considerations](#name-interoperability-considerat){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-interoperability-considerat}

The extension described in this document is designed to allow
RPC-over-RDMA version implementations that use CM Private Data to
interoperate fully with RPC-over-RDMA version 1 implementations that do
not exchange this information. Implementations that use this extension
must also interoperate fully with RDMA implementations that use CM
Private Data for other purposes. Realizing these goals requires that
implementations of this extension follow the practices described in the
rest of this section.[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

When a peer does not receive a CM Private Data message that conforms to
[Section 4](#section_99541DF3-E579-42B6-9C7A-D020926798F6){.xref}, it
needs to act as if the remote peer supports only the default
RPC-over-RDMA version 1 settings, as defined in
\[[RFC8166](#RFC8166){.xref}\]. In other words, the peer [MUST]{.bcp14}
behave as if a Private Data message was received in which (1) bit 15 of
the Flags field is zero and (2) both Size fields contain the value
zero.[¶](#section-5.1-1){.pilcrow}

### [5.2.](#section-5.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Interoperability amongst RDMA Transports](#name-interoperability-amongst-rd){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-interoperability-amongst-rd}

The Format Identifier field defined in [Section
4](#section_99541DF3-E579-42B6-9C7A-D020926798F6){.xref} is provided to
enable implementations to distinguish the Private Data defined in this
document from Private Data inserted at other layers, such as the
additional Private Data defined by the MPAv2 protocol described in
\[[RFC6581](#RFC6581){.xref}\], and others.[¶](#section-5.2-1){.pilcrow}

As part of connection establishment, the buffer containing the received
Private Data is searched for the Format Identifier word. The offset of
the Format Identifier is not restricted to any alignment. If the
RPC-over-RDMA version 1 CM Private Data Format Identifier is not
present, an RPC-over-RDMA version 1 receiver [MUST]{.bcp14} behave as if
no RPC-over-RDMA version 1 CM Private Data has been
provided.[¶](#section-5.2-2){.pilcrow}

Once the RPC-over-RDMA version 1 CM Private Data Format Identifier is
found, the receiver parses the subsequent octets as RPC-over-RDMA
version 1 CM Private Data. As additional assurance that the content is
valid RPC-over-RDMA version 1 CM Private Data, the receiver should check
that the format version number field contains a valid and recognized
version number and the size of the content does not overrun the length
of the buffer.[¶](#section-5.2-3){.pilcrow}

## [6.](#section-6){.section-number .selfRef} [Updating the Message Format](#name-updating-the-message-format){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-updating-the-message-format}

Although the message format described in this document provides the
ability for the client and server to exchange particular information
about the local RPC-over-RDMA implementation, it is possible that there
will be a future need to exchange additional properties. This would make
it necessary to extend or otherwise modify the format described in this
document.[¶](#section-6-1){.pilcrow}

Any modification faces the problem of interoperating properly with
implementations of RPC-over-RDMA version 1 that are unaware of the
existence of the new format. These include implementations that do not
recognize the exchange of CM Private Data as well as those that
recognize only the format described in this
document.[¶](#section-6-2){.pilcrow}

Given the message format described in this document, these
interoperability constraints could be met by the following sorts of new
message formats:[¶](#section-6-3){.pilcrow}

-   [A format that uses a different value for the first four bytes of
    the format, as provided for in the registry described in [Section
    8](#section_8701C122-F206-4F87-8FA6-62F1CD648A14){.xref}.[¶](#section-6-4.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-6-4.1}
-   [A format that uses the same value for the Format Identifier field
    and a value other than one (1) in the Version
    field.[¶](#section-6-4.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-6-4.2}

Although it is possible to reorganize the last three of the eight bytes
in the existing format, extended formats are unlikely to do so. New
formats would take the form of extensions of the format described in
this document with added fields starting at byte eight of the format or
changes to the definition of bits in the Reserved
field.[¶](#section-6-5){.pilcrow}

## [7.](#section-7){.section-number .selfRef} [Security Considerations](#name-security-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-security-considerations}

The reader is directed to the Security Considerations section of
\[[RFC8166](#RFC8166){.xref}\] for background and further
discussion.[¶](#section-7-1){.pilcrow}

The RPC-over-RDMA version 1 protocol framework depends on the semantics
of the Reliable Connected (RC) queue pair (QP) type, as defined in
Section 9.7.7 of \[[IBA](#IBA){.xref}\]. The integrity of CM Private
Data and the authenticity of its source are ensured by the exclusive use
of RC QPs. Any attempt to interfere with or hijack data in transit on an
RC connection results in the RDMA provider terminating the
connection.[¶](#section-7-2){.pilcrow}

The Security Considerations section of \[[RFC5042](#RFC5042){.xref}\]
refers the reader to further relevant discussion of generic RDMA
transport security. That document recommends IPsec as the default
transport-layer security solution. When deployed with the Remote Direct
Memory Access Protocol (RDMAP) \[[RFC5040](#RFC5040){.xref}\], DDP
\[[RFC5041](#RFC5041){.xref}\], and MPA \[[RFC5044](#RFC5044){.xref}\],
IPsec establishes a protected channel before any operations are
exchanged; thus, it protects the exchange of Private Data. However,
IPsec is not available for InfiniBand or RDMA over Converged Ethernet
(RoCE) deployments. Those fabrics rely on physical security and cyclic
redundancy checks to protect network traffic.[¶](#section-7-3){.pilcrow}

Exchanging the information contained in the message format defined in
this document does not expose upper-layer payloads to an attacker.
Furthermore, the behavior changes that occur as a result of exchanging
the Private Data described in the current document do not introduce any
new risk of exposure of upper-layer payload
data.[¶](#section-7-4){.pilcrow}

Improperly setting one of the fields in version 1 Private Data can
result in an increased risk of disconnection (i.e., self-imposed Denial
of Service). A similar risk can arise if non-RPC-over-RDMA CM Private
Data inadvertently contains the Format Identifier that identifies this
protocol\'s data structure. Additional checking of incoming Private
Data, as described in [Section
5.2](#section_0BD80E15-13FF-4210-A1D8-E0AE531821A4){.xref}, can help
reduce this risk.[¶](#section-7-5){.pilcrow}

In addition to describing the structure of a new format version, any
document that extends the Private Data format described in the current
document must discuss security considerations of new data items
exchanged between connection peers. Such documents should also explore
the risks of erroneously identifying non-RPC-over-RDMA CM Private Data
as the new format.[¶](#section-7-6){.pilcrow}

## [8.](#section-8){.section-number .selfRef} [IANA Considerations](#name-iana-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-iana-considerations}

IANA has created the \"RDMA-CM Private Data Identifiers\" subregistry
within the \"Remote Direct Data Placement\" protocol category group.
This is a subregistry of 32-bit numbers that identify the upper-layer
protocol associated with data that appears in the application-specific
RDMA-CM Private Data area. The fields in this subregistry include the
following: Format Identifier, Length (format length, in octets),
Description, and Reference.[¶](#section-8-1){.pilcrow}

The initial contents of this registry are a single
entry:[¶](#section-8-2){.pilcrow}

IANA is to assign subsequent new entries in this registry using the
Specification Required policy as defined in [Section
4.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8126#section-4.6){.relref} of

The Designated Expert (DE), appointed by the IESG, should ascertain the
existence of suitable documentation that defines the semantics and
format of the Private Data, and verify that the document is permanently
and publicly available. Documentation produced outside the IETF must not
conflict with work that is active or already published within the IETF.
The new Reference field should contain a reference to that
documentation.[¶](#section-8.1-1){.pilcrow}

The Description field should contain the name of the upper-layer
protocol that generates and uses the Private
Data.[¶](#section-8.1-2){.pilcrow}

The DE should assign a new Format Identifier so that it does not
conflict with existing entries in this registry and so that it is not
likely to be mistaken as part of the payload of other registered
formats.[¶](#section-8.1-3){.pilcrow}

The DE shall post the request to the NFSV4 Working Group mailing list
(or a successor to that list, if such a list exists) for comment and
review. The DE shall approve or deny the request and publish notice of
the decision within 30 days.[¶](#section-8.1-4){.pilcrow}
