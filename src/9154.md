# Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) Secure Authorization Information for Transfer {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

The Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) (RFC 5730) defines the use of
authorization information to authorize a transfer of an EPP object, such
as a domain name, between clients that are referred to as
\"registrars\". Object-specific, password-based authorization
information (see RFCs 5731 and 5733) is commonly used but raises issues
related to the security, complexity, storage, and lifetime of
authentication information. This document defines an operational
practice, using the EPP RFCs, that leverages the use of strong random
authorization information values that are short lived, not stored by the
client, and stored by the server using a cryptographic hash that
provides for secure authorization information that can safely be used
for object transfers.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

The Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP)
\[[RFC5730](#RFC5730){.xref}\] defines the use of authorization
information to authorize a transfer of an EPP object, such as a domain
name, between clients that are referred to as \"registrars\". The
authorization information is object specific and has been defined in
\"[Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) Domain Name
Mapping](#RFC5731){.xref}\" \[[RFC5731](#RFC5731){.xref}\] and
\"[Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) Contact
Mapping](#RFC5733){.xref}\" \[[RFC5733](#RFC5733){.xref}\] as
password-based authorization information. Other authorization mechanisms
can be used, but in practice the password-based authorization
information has been used at the time of object creation, managed with
the object update, and used to authorize an object transfer request.
What has not been considered is the security of the authorization
information, which includes the complexity of the authorization
information, the Time To Live (TTL) of the authorization information,
and where and how the authorization information is
stored.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

The current/original lifecycle for authorization information involves
long-term storage of encrypted (not hashed) passwords, which presents a
significant latent risk of password compromise and is not consistent
with current best practices. The mechanisms in this document provide a
way to avoid long-term password storage entirely and to only require the
storage of hashed (not retrievable) passwords instead of encrypted
passwords.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

This document defines an operational practice, using the EPP RFCs, that
leverages the use of strong, random authorization information values
that are short lived, not stored by the client, and stored by the server
using a cryptographic hash to provide secure authorization information
used for transfers. This operational practice can be used to support
transfers of any EPP object, where the domain name object as defined in
\[[RFC5731](#RFC5731){.xref}\] is used in this document for illustration
purposes. Elements of the practice may be used to support the secure use
of the authorization information for purposes other than transfer, but
any other purposes and the applicable elements are out of scope for this
document.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

The overall goal is to have strong, random authorization information
values that are short lived and are either not stored or stored as
cryptographic hash values by the non-responsible parties. In a
registrant, registrar, and registry model, the registrant registers the
object through the registrar to the registry. The registrant is the
responsible party, and the registrar and the registry are the
non-responsible parties. EPP is a protocol between the registrar and the
registry, where the registrar is referred to as the \"client\" and the
registry is referred to as the \"server\". The following are the
elements of the operational practice and how the existing features of
the EPP RFCs can be leveraged to satisfy
them:[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

Strong Random Authorization Information:
:   The EPP RFCs define the password-based authorization information
    value using an XML schema \"normalizedString\" type, so they don\'t
    restrict what can be used in any substantial way. This operational
    practice defines the recommended mechanism for creating a strong
    random authorization value that would be generated by the
    client.[¶](#section-1-5.2){.pilcrow}
:   

Short-Lived Authorization Information:
:   The EPP RFCs don\'t explicitly support short-lived authorization
    information or a TTL for authorization information, but there are
    EPP RFC features that can be leveraged to support short-lived
    authorization information. All of these features are compatible with
    the EPP RFCs, though not mandatory to implement. As stated in
    [Section
    2.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5731#section-2.6){.relref} of
    \[[RFC5731](#RFC5731){.xref}\], authorization information is
    assigned when a domain object is created, which results in
    long-lived authorization information. This specification changes the
    nature of the authorization information from long lived to short
    lived. If authorization information is set only when a transfer is
    in process, the server needs to support an empty authorization
    information value on create, support setting and unsetting
    authorization information, and support automatically unsetting the
    authorization information upon a successful transfer. All of these
    features can be supported by the EPP
    RFCs.[¶](#section-1-5.4){.pilcrow}
:   

Storing Authorization Information Securely:
:   The EPP RFCs don\'t specify where and how the authorization
    information is stored in the client or the server, so there are no
    restrictions on defining an operational practice for storing the
    authorization information securely. The operational practice will
    require the client to not store the authorization information and
    will require the server to store the authorization information using
    a cryptographic hash with at least a 256-bit hash function, such as
    SHA-256 \[[FIPS-180-4](#FIPS-180-4){.xref}\], and with a
    per-authorization information random salt with at least 128 bits.
    Returning the authorization information set in an EPP info response
    will not be supported.[¶](#section-1-5.6){.pilcrow}

The EPP RFCs refer to \"client\" and \"server\", but when it comes to
transfers, there are three types of actors that are involved. This
document will refer to these actors as \"registrant\", \"registrar\",
and \"registry\". \[[RFC8499](#RFC8499){.xref}\] defines these terms
formally for the Domain Name System (DNS). The terms are further
described below to cover their roles as actors using the authorization
information in the transfer process of any object in the registry, such
as a domain name or a contact:[¶](#section-2-1){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

Registrant:
:   \[[RFC8499](#RFC8499){.xref}\] defines the registrant as \"an
    individual or organization on whose behalf a name in a zone is
    registered by the registry.\" The registrant can be the owner of any
    object in the registry, such as a domain name or a contact. The
    registrant interfaces with the registrar for provisioning the
    objects. A transfer is coordinated by the registrant to transfer the
    sponsorship of the object from one registrar to another. The
    authorization information is meant to authenticate the registrant as
    the owner of the object to the non-sponsoring registrar and to
    authorize the transfer.[¶](#section-2-2.2){.pilcrow}
:   

Registrar:
:   \[[RFC8499](#RFC8499){.xref}\] defines the registrar as \"a service
    provider that acts as a go-between for registrants and registries.\"
    The registrar interfaces with the registrant for the provisioning of
    objects, such as domain names and contacts, and with the registries
    to satisfy the registrant\'s provisioning requests. A registrar may
    (1) directly interface with the registrant or (2) indirectly
    interface with the registrant, typically through one or more
    resellers. Implementing a transfer using secure authorization
    information extends through the registrar\'s reseller channel up to
    the direct interface with the registrant. The registrar\'s interface
    with the registries uses EPP. The registrar\'s interface with its
    reseller channel or the registrant is registrar specific. In the EPP
    RFCs, the registrar is referred to as the \"client\", since EPP is
    the protocol used between the registrar and the registry. The
    sponsoring registrar is the authorized registrar to manage objects
    on behalf of the registrant. A non-sponsoring registrar is not
    authorized to manage objects on behalf of the registrant. A transfer
    of an object\'s sponsorship is from one registrar, referred to as
    the \"losing registrar\", to another registrar, referred to as the
    \"gaining registrar\".[¶](#section-2-2.4){.pilcrow}
:   

Registry:
:   \[[RFC8499](#RFC8499){.xref}\] defines the registry as \"the
    administrative operation of a zone that allows registration of names
    within that zone.\" The registry typically interfaces with the
    registrars over EPP and generally does not interact directly with
    the registrant. In the EPP RFCs, the registry is referred to as the
    \"server\", since EPP is the protocol used between the registrar and
    the registry. The registry has a record of the sponsoring registrar
    for each object and provides the mechanism (over EPP) to coordinate
    a transfer of an object\'s sponsorship between
    registrars.[¶](#section-2-2.6){.pilcrow}

This document does not define a new protocol; rather, it defines an
operational practice using existing EPP features, where the client and
the server can signal support for the operational practice using a
namespace URI in the login and greeting extension services. The
namespace URI
\"urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp:secure-authinfo-transfer-1.0\" is used to

The EPP RFCs (\[[RFC5731](#RFC5731){.xref}\] and
\[[RFC5733](#RFC5733){.xref}\]) use password-based authorization
information to support transfer with the \<domain:pw> element
\[[RFC5731](#RFC5731){.xref}\] and with the \<contact:pw> element
\[[RFC5733](#RFC5733){.xref}\]. Other EPP objects that support
password-based authorization information for transfer can use secure
authorization information as defined in this document. For authorization
information to be secure, it must be generated using a strong random
value and have a short TTL. The security of the authorization
information is defined in the following
sections.[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

### [4.1.](#section-4.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Secure Random Authorization Information](#name-secure-random-authorization){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-secure-random-authorization}

For authorization information to be secure, it [MUST]{.bcp14} be
generated using a secure random value. The authorization information is
treated as a password, and the required length L of a password, rounded
up to the largest whole number, is based on the size N of the set of
characters and the desired entropy H, in the equation L = ROUNDUP(H /
log~2~ N). Given a target entropy, the required length can be calculated
after deciding on the set of characters that will be randomized. In
accordance with current best practices and noting that the authorization
information is a machine-generated value, the implementation
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} use at least 128 bits of entropy as the value of H. The
lengths below are calculated using that
value.[¶](#section-4.1-1){.pilcrow}

Calculation of the required length with 128 bits of entropy and with the
set of all printable ASCII characters except space (0x20), which
consists of the 94 characters 0x21-0x7E:[¶](#section-4.1-2){.pilcrow}

ROUNDUP(128 / log~2~ 94) =\~ ROUNDUP(128 / 6.55) =\~ ROUNDUP(19.54) =
20[¶](#section-4.1-3){.pilcrow}

Calculation of the required length with 128 bits of entropy and with the
set of case-insensitive alphanumeric characters, which consists of 36
characters (a-z A-Z 0-9):[¶](#section-4.1-4){.pilcrow}

ROUNDUP(128 / log~2~ 36) =\~ ROUNDUP(128 / 5.17) =\~ ROUNDUP(24.76) =
25[¶](#section-4.1-5){.pilcrow}

The strength of the random authorization information is dependent on the
random number generator. Suitably strong random number generators are
available in a wide variety of implementation environments, including
the interfaces listed in
Sections [7.1.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4086#section-7.1.2){.relref}
and
[7.1.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4086#section-7.1.3){.relref}
of \[[RFC4086](#RFC4086){.xref}\]. In environments that do not provide
interfaces to strong random number generators, the practices defined in

The authorization information [SHOULD]{.bcp14} only be set when a
transfer is in process. This implies that the authorization information
has a TTL by which the authorization information is cleared when the TTL
expires. The EPP RFCs do not provide definitions for TTL, but since the
server supports the setting and unsetting of the authorization
information by the sponsoring registrar, the sponsoring registrar can
apply a TTL based on client policy. The TTL client policy may be based
on proprietary registrar-specific criteria, which provides for a
transfer-specific TTL tuned for the particular circumstances of the
transaction. The sponsoring registrar will be aware of the TTL, and the
sponsoring registrar [MUST]{.bcp14} inform the registrant of the TTL
when the authorization information is provided to the
registrant.[¶](#section-4.2-1){.pilcrow}

following requirements apply:[¶](#section-4.3-1){.pilcrow}

1.  [The authorization information [MUST]{.bcp14} be stored by the
    registry using a strong one-way cryptographic hash with at least a
    256-bit hash function, such as SHA-256
    \[[FIPS-180-4](#FIPS-180-4){.xref}\], and with a per-authorization
    information random salt with at least 128
    bits.[¶](#section-4.3-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.3-2.1}
2.  [An empty authorization information value [MUST]{.bcp14} be stored
    as an undefined value that is referred to as a \"NULL\" value. The
    representation of a NULL (undefined) value is dependent on the type
    of database used.[¶](#section-4.3-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.3-2.2}

### [4.4.](#section-4.4){.section-number .selfRef} [Authorization Information Matching](#name-authorization-information-m){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-authorization-information-m}

To support the authorization information TTL, as described in [Section
4.2](#authInfoTTL){.xref}, the authorization information must have
either a set or unset state. Authorization information that is unset is
stored with a NULL (undefined) value. Based on the requirement to store
the authorization information using a strong one-way cryptographic hash,
as described in [Section 4.3](#authInfoStorageTransport){.xref},
authorization information that is set is stored with a non-NULL hashed
value. The empty authorization information value is used as input in
both the [\<create> command](#createCommand){.xref} ([Section
5.1](#createCommand){.xref}) and the [\<update>
command](#updateCommand){.xref} ([Section 5.2](#updateCommand){.xref})
to define the unset state. The matching of the authorization information
in the [\<info> command](#infoCommandResponse){.xref} ([Section
5.3](#infoCommandResponse){.xref}) and the [\<transfer> request
command](#transferRequestCommand){.xref} ([Section
5.4](#transferRequestCommand){.xref}) is based on the following
rules:[¶](#section-4.4-1){.pilcrow}

1.  [Any input authorization information value [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} match
    an unset authorization information value. For example, in
    \[[RFC5731](#RFC5731){.xref}\] the input
    \<domain:pw>2fooBAR\</domain:pw> must not match an unset
    authorization information value that used \<domain:null/> or
    \<domain:pw/>.[¶](#section-4.4-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.4-2.1}
2.  [An empty input authorization information value [MUST NOT]{.bcp14}
    match any set authorization information
    value.[¶](#section-4.4-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.4-2.2}
3.  [A non-empty input authorization information value [MUST]{.bcp14} be

To secure the transfer process using secure authorization information as
described in [Section 4](#secureAuthInfo){.xref}, the client and server
need to implement steps where the authorization information is set only

information is stored securely and transported only over secure
channels. The steps for management of the authorization information for
transfers include the following:[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

    gaining registrar.[¶](#section-5-2.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-5-2.4}

    information with the \<info> command to the registry, as described

the passing of a non-empty authorization information value. By having an
empty authorization information value on create, the object is initially
not involved in the transfer process. Any EPP object extension that
supports setting the authorization information with an
\"eppcom:pwAuthInfoType\" element can pass an empty authorization
information value. Examples of such extensions are found in

::: {#section-5.2 .section}
### [5.2.](#section-5.2){.section-number .selfRef} [\<Update> Command](#name-update-command){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-update-command}

For an \<update> command, the registry [MUST]{.bcp14} allow the setting
and unsetting of the authorization information. The registrar sets the
authorization information by first generating a strong, random
authorization information value, based on the information provided in
[Section 4.1](#secureRandomAuthInfo){.xref}, and setting it in the
registry in the \<update> command. The importance of generating strong
authorization information values cannot be overstated: secure transfers
are very important to the Internet to mitigate damage in the form of
theft, fraud, and other abuse. It is critical that registrars only use
strong, randomly generated authorization information
values.[¶](#section-5.2-1){.pilcrow}

Because of this, registries may validate the randomness of the
authorization information based on the length and character set required
by the registry \-- for example, validating that an authorization value
contains a combination of uppercase, lowercase, and non-alphanumeric
characters in an attempt to assess the strength of the value and
returning an EPP error result of 2202 (\"Invalid authorization
information\") \[[RFC5730](#RFC5730){.xref}\] if the check
fails.[¶](#section-5.2-2){.pilcrow}

Such checks are, by their nature, heuristic and imperfect, and may
identify well-chosen authorization information values as being not
sufficiently strong. Registrars, therefore, must be prepared for an
error response of 2202 and respond by generating a new value and trying
again, possibly more than once.[¶](#section-5.2-3){.pilcrow}

Often, the registrar has the \"clientTransferProhibited\" status set, so
to start the transfer process, the \"clientTransferProhibited\" status
needs to be removed, and the strong, random authorization information
value needs to be set. The registrar [MUST]{.bcp14} define a TTL, as
described in [Section 4.2](#authInfoTTL){.xref}, and if the TTL expires,
the registrar will unset the authorization
information.[¶](#section-5.2-4){.pilcrow}

:::

When the registrar-defined TTL expires, the sponsoring registrar
[MUST]{.bcp14} cancel the transfer process by unsetting the
authorization information value and [MAY]{.bcp14} add back statuses like
the \"clientTransferProhibited\" status. Any EPP object extension that
supports setting the authorization information with an
\"eppcom:pwAuthInfoType\" element can pass an empty authorization
information value. Examples of such extensions are found in
\[[RFC5731](#RFC5731){.xref}\] and \[[RFC5733](#RFC5733){.xref}\].
Setting an empty authorization information value unsets the
authorization information. \[[RFC5731](#RFC5731){.xref}\] supports an
explicit mechanism of unsetting the authorization information, by

## [6.](#section-6){.section-number .selfRef} [Transition Considerations](#name-transition-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-transition-considerations}

The goal of the transition considerations is to minimize the impact to
the registrars in supporting the Secure Authorization Information Model
defined in this document by supporting incremental transition steps. The
transition steps are dependent on the starting point of the registry.
Registries may have different starting points, since some of the
elements of the Secure Authorization Information Model may have already
been implemented. The considerations assume a starting point, referred
to as the \"Classic Authorization Information Model\", which
incorporates the following steps for management of the authorization
information for transfers:[¶](#section-6-1){.pilcrow}

1.  [The registrant requests to register the object with the registrar.
    The registrar sends the \<create> command, with a non-empty
    authorization information value, to the registry. The registry
    stores the authorization information as an encrypted value and
    requires a non-empty authorization information value for the life of
    the object. The registrar may store the long-lived authorization
    information.[¶](#section-6-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-6-2.1}
2.  [At the time of transfer, the registrant requests from the losing
    registrar the authorization information to provide to the gaining
    registrar.[¶](#section-6-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-6-2.2}
3.  [The losing registrar retrieves the locally stored authorization
    information or queries the registry for authorization information
    using the \<info> command, and provides it to the registrant. If the
    registry is queried, the authorization information is decrypted and
    the plain-text authorization information is returned in the info
    response to the
    registrar.[¶](#section-6-2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-6-2.3}
4.  [The registrant provides the authorization information value to the
    gaining registrar.[¶](#section-6-2.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-6-2.4}
5.  [The gaining registrar optionally verifies the authorization
    information with the \<info> command to the registry, by passing the
    authorization information in the \<info> command to the
    registry.[¶](#section-6-2.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-6-2.5}
6.  [The gaining registrar sends the transfer request with the
    authorization information to the registry. The registry will decrypt
    the stored authorization information to compare to the passed
    authorization
    information.[¶](#section-6-2.6){.pilcrow}]{#section-6-2.6}
7.  [If the transfer completes successfully, the authorization
    information is not touched by the registry and may be updated by the
    gaining registrar using the \<update> command. If the transfer is
    canceled or rejected, the losing registrar may reset the
    authorization information using the \<update>
    command.[¶](#section-6-2.7){.pilcrow}]{#section-6-2.7}

The gaps between the Classic Authorization Information Model and the
Secure Authorization Information Model include the
following:[¶](#section-6-3){.pilcrow}

1.  [Registry requirement for a non-empty authorization information
    value on create and for the life of the object versus the
    authorization information not being set on create and only being set
    when a transfer is in
    process.[¶](#section-6-4.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-6-4.1}
2.  [Registry not allowing the authorization information to be unset
    versus providing support for unsetting the authorization information
    in the \<update>
    command.[¶](#section-6-4.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-6-4.2}
3.  [Registry storing the authorization information as an encrypted
    value versus a hashed
    value.[¶](#section-6-4.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-6-4.3}
4.  [Registry support for returning the authorization information versus
    not returning the authorization information in the info
    response.[¶](#section-6-4.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-6-4.4}
5.  [Registry not touching the authorization information versus the
    registry automatically unsetting the authorization information upon
    a successful transfer.[¶](#section-6-4.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-6-4.5}
6.  [Registry possibly validating a shorter authorization information
    value using password complexity rules versus validating the
    randomness of a longer authorization information value that meets
    the required bits of
    entropy.[¶](#section-6-4.6){.pilcrow}]{#section-6-4.6}

The transition can be handled in the three phases defined in
Sections [6.1](#TransitionFeatures){.xref},
[6.2](#TransitionStorage){.xref}, and
[6.3](#TransitionEnforcement){.xref}.[¶](#section-6-5){.pilcrow}

::: {#TransitionFeatures}
::: {#section-6.1 .section}
### [6.1.](#section-6.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Transition Phase 1 - Features](#name-transition-phase-1-features){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-transition-phase-1-features}

The goal of \"Transition Phase 1 - Features\" is to implement the needed
features in EPP so that the registrar can optionally implement the
Secure Authorization Information Model. The features to implement are
broken out by the commands and responses
below:[¶](#section-6.1-1){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

\<Create> Command:
:   Change the \<create> command to make the authorization information
    optional, by allowing both a non-empty value and an empty value.
    This enables a registrar to optionally create objects without an
    authorization information value, as described in [Section
    5.1](#createCommand){.xref}.[¶](#section-6.1-2.2){.pilcrow}
:   

\<Update> Command:
:   Change the \<update> command to allow unsetting the authorization
    information, as described in [Section 5.2](#updateCommand){.xref}.
    This enables the registrar to optionally unset the authorization
    information when the TTL expires or when the transfer is canceled or
    rejected.[¶](#section-6.1-2.4){.pilcrow}
:   

Transfer Approve Command and Transfer Auto-Approve:
:   Change the transfer approve command and the transfer auto-approve to
    automatically unset the authorization information. This sets the
    default state of the object to not have the authorization
    information set. The registrar implementing the Secure Authorization
    Information Model will not set the authorization information for an
    inbound transfer, and the registrar implementing the Classic
    Authorization Information Model will set the new authorization
    information upon a successful
    transfer.[¶](#section-6.1-2.6){.pilcrow}
:   

Info Response:
:   Change the \<info> command to not return the authorization
    information in the info response, as described in [Section
    5.3](#infoCommandResponse){.xref}. This sets up the implementation
    of \"Transition Phase 2 - Storage\" ([Section
    6.2](#TransitionStorage){.xref}), since the dependency on returning
    the authorization information in the info response will be removed.
    This feature is the only one that is not an optional change to the
    registrar, and this change could potentially break the client, so
    it\'s recommended that the registry provide notice of the
    change.[¶](#section-6.1-2.8){.pilcrow}
:   

\<Info> Command and Transfer Request:
:   Change the \<info> command and the transfer request to ensure that a
    registrar cannot get an indication that the authorization
    information is set or not set by returning the EPP error result code
    of 2202 when comparing a passed authorization to a non-matching set
    authorization information value or an unset
    value.[¶](#section-6.1-2.10){.pilcrow}

### [6.2.](#section-6.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Transition Phase 2 - Storage](#name-transition-phase-2-storage){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-transition-phase-2-storage}

The goal of \"Transition Phase 2 - Storage\" is to transition the
registry to use hashed authorization information instead of encrypted
authorization information. There is no direct impact on the registrars,
since the only visible indication that the authorization information has
been hashed is that the set authorization information is not returned in
the info response, as addressed in [\"Transition Phase 1 -
Features\"](#TransitionFeatures){.xref} ([Section
6.1](#TransitionFeatures){.xref}). Transitioning the authorization
information storage includes the following three
steps:[¶](#section-6.2-1){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

Hash New Authorization Information Values:
:   Change the \<create> command and the \<update> command to hash
    rather than encrypt the authorization
    information.[¶](#section-6.2-2.2){.pilcrow}
:   

Support Comparison against Encrypted or Hashed Authorization Information:
:   Change the \<info> command and the \<transfer> request command to be
    able to compare a passed authorization information value with either
    a hashed or encrypted authorization information value. This requires
    that the stored values be self-identifying as being in hashed or
    encrypted form.[¶](#section-6.2-2.4){.pilcrow}
:   

Hash Existing Encrypted Authorization Information Values:
:   Convert the encrypted authorization information values stored in the
    registry database to hashed values. This update will not be visible
    to the registrar. The conversion can be done over a period of time,
    depending on registry policy.[¶](#section-6.2-2.6){.pilcrow}

The goal of \"Transition Phase 3 - Enforcement\" is to complete the
implementation of the Secure Authorization Information Model, by
enforcing the following:[¶](#section-6.3-1){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

Disallow Authorization Information on \<Create> Command:
:   Change the \<create> command to not allow the passing of a non-empty
    authorization information value. This behavior could potentially
    break the client, so it\'s recommended that the registry provide
    notice of this change.[¶](#section-6.3-2.2){.pilcrow}
:   

Validate the Strong Random Authorization Information:
:   Change the validation of the authorization information in the
    \<update> command to ensure at least 128 bits of
    entropy.[¶](#section-6.3-2.4){.pilcrow}
