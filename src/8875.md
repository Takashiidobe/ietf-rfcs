# RFC 8875 {#rfcnum}

# Working Group GitHub Administration {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

The use of GitHub in IETF working group processes is increasing. This
document describes uses and conventions for working groups that are
considering starting to use GitHub. It does not mandate any processes
and does not require changes to the processes used by current and future
working groups not using GitHub.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

Many IETF working groups and participants make use of GitHub in
different ways as part of their work on IETF documents. Some others are
interested in having their working groups use GitHub to facilitate the
development of working group documents, but they are unfamiliar with how
to get started or unclear about which conventions to follow. Some other
working groups use or plan to use other code-repository services such as
GitLab and Bitbucket, which have different properties than
GitHub.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

This document specifies a set of administrative processes and
conventions for IETF working groups to use if they choose as a working
group to use GitHub to facilitate their work. The specifications in this
document are not directed at working groups or individuals that are
already using GitHub to do IETF work. Practices vary among existing
working groups, and some of them are not consistent with the conventions
proposed here: that is fine. The goal of the specifications in this
document is not to require uniformity in current practice, but to help
working groups get started using GitHub in a reviewed and validated way,
if desired.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-2 .section}
## [2.](#section-2){.section-number .selfRef} [Administrative Process and Conventions](#name-administrative-process-and-){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-administrative-process-and-}

This section specifies an administrative process and conventions to
support the creation and management of GitHub organizations for working
groups and single-document repositories in a uniform way. The steps may
be done manually by the IETF Secretariat, or they may be automated. See
\<<https://github.com/richsalz/ietf-gh-scripts>\> and
\<<https://github.com/martinthomson/i-d-template>\> for working examples
of automation that is in use in some working
groups.[¶](#section-2-1){.pilcrow}

In this document the question of whether processes should be manual or
automated is deliberately left unspecified, since these are
implementation details that the IETF Secretariat and Tools Team will
address.[¶](#section-2-2){.pilcrow}

Most of the conventions below are drawn from
\[[RFC8874](#RFC8874){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2-3){.pilcrow}

::: {#creation}
::: {#section-2.1 .section}
### [2.1.](#section-2.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Creation of GitHub Organizations](#name-creation-of-github-organiza){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-creation-of-github-organiza}

This document specifies that there be a facility in the IETF Datatracker
(\<<https://datatracker.ietf.org/>\>) interface to allow an area
director (AD) or working group chair to request the creation of a GitHub
organization for a particular working group. Ideally, this facility
would appear both as part of the working group chartering UI and the
working group page UI.[¶](#section-2.1-1){.pilcrow}

When an area director or working group chair makes a request to create a
GitHub organization, the following process would be
initiated:[¶](#section-2.1-2){.pilcrow}

1.  [Create a GitHub organization for the working
    group.[¶](#section-2.1-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.1-3.1}

2.  [Name the organization in the format
    ietf-wg-\<wgname>\...[¶](#section-2.1-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.1-3.2}

3.  ::: {#section-2.1-3.3}
    ::: {#S3}
    Initialize the organization by designating the IETF Secretariat and
    the area directors in the working group\'s area as owners. If the
    responsible AD for the working group is from another area, that AD
    will be an owner as well.[¶](#S3){.pilcrow}
    :::
    :::

4.  ::: {#section-2.1-3.4}
    ::: {#S4}
    Initialize the organization with a team that has administrator
    access. This team will consist of the working group chairs and
    working group secretary, if one exists.[¶](#S4){.pilcrow}
    :::
    :::

After the organization is created, the URL for the organization would be
added to the working group\'s page in the
Datatracker.[¶](#section-2.1-4){.pilcrow}

Steps [3](#S3){.xref} and [4](#S4){.xref} above imply that the GitHub
identities of the organization owners and administrators are known.
Recording GitHub identities in the Datatracker (see
\<<https://trac.tools.ietf.org/tools/ietfdb/ticket/2548>\>) would
facilitate this. The person requesting the organization would need to be
notified if the GitHub identities of any of the people meant to be
owners or administrators were not
available.[¶](#section-2.1-5){.pilcrow}

### [2.2.](#section-2.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Migration of an Existing Organization](#name-migration-of-an-existing-or){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-migration-of-an-existing-or}

If a working group already has an organization, it would be useful to be
able to make it have the same management as one would get by going
through the steps in [Section 2.1](#creation){.xref}. That is, it would
be good to be able to run Steps [3](#S3){.xref} and [4](#S4){.xref} from
[Section 2.1](#creation){.xref} so that the rest of the activities in
this section, such as personnel changes, work the same way as for
organizations that were created as specified
herein.[¶](#section-2.2-1){.pilcrow}
:::
:::

::: {#personnel-changes}
::: {#section-2.3 .section}
### [2.3.](#section-2.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Personnel Changes](#name-personnel-changes){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-personnel-changes}

When there are personnel changes in the area or the working group, those
changes would be reflected in the GitHub organization. There should be
an ability in the Datatracker to specify that personnel changes have
occurred.[¶](#section-2.3-1){.pilcrow}
:::
:::

::: {#working-group-closing}
::: {#section-2.4 .section}
### [2.4.](#section-2.4){.section-number .selfRef} [Working Group Closing](#name-working-group-closing){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-working-group-closing}

When a working group is closed, the team with administrative access
would be removed, and the owner list would be returned to the
Secretariat and current ADs at the time of closing. The organization
summary and the repositories within the organization would be updated to
indicate that they are no longer under development. Later, the owner
list could become just the Secretariat, or it might include others
chosen by the Secretariat or the IESG.[¶](#section-2.4-1){.pilcrow}
:::
:::

::: {#repo_create}
::: {#section-2.5 .section}
### [2.5.](#section-2.5){.section-number .selfRef} [Creation of Document Repository](#name-creation-of-document-reposi){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-creation-of-document-reposi}

There are many different scenarios and configurations where it might be
useful to have automation or established administrative conventions for
repositories within WG organizations, such
as:[¶](#section-2.5-1){.pilcrow}

-   [Creating a new repository for an individual draft (at the
    discretion of the WG
    chair);[¶](#section-2.5-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.5-2.1}
-   [Creating a new repository for an already adopted working group
    draft;[¶](#section-2.5-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.5-2.2}
-   [Migrating an existing document repository into the WG organization;
    and[¶](#section-2.5-2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.5-2.3}
-   [Creating a new repository that contains multiple
    drafts.[¶](#section-2.5-2.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.5-2.4}

As an incremental step, this document specifies that there be a facility
in the Datatracker interface to allow an administrator of an
ietf-wg-\<wgname> organization to request the creation of a new
repository within that organization for a single document. The document
authors would be identified as collaborators. The repository name would
be the draft name. Ideally, the repository would be configured with a
skeleton draft file, default CONTRIBUTING, LICENSE, and README files,
and continuous integration support, in the vein of
\<<https://github.com/martinthomson/i-d-template>\>. Performing this
step would automatically inform the IETF Secretariat that this
repository should be backed up as described in [Section
3.2](#backup){.xref}.[¶](#section-2.5-3){.pilcrow}

### [2.6.](#section-2.6){.section-number .selfRef} [Listing Related Repositories](#name-listing-related-repositorie){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-listing-related-repositorie}

The IETF Datatracker should allow users to add links to repositories
(for GitHub and other repository services) on working group, document,
and user pages. At the time of this writing, this feature was under
development.[¶](#section-2.6-1){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-3 .section}
## [3.](#section-3){.section-number .selfRef} [Working Group Process](#name-working-group-process){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-working-group-process}

\[[RFC8874](#RFC8874){.xref}\] contains discussion of the different
possible ways that a working group can use GitHub and the large number
of decisions associated with doing so. This section specifies a basic
set of administrative policies for working groups to follow and the
administrative support needed to carry out those
policies.[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

::: {#contributions}
::: {#section-3.1 .section}
### [3.1.](#section-3.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Contributions](#name-contributions){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-contributions}

At a minimum, every repository created in a working group organization
needs to incorporate into its CONTRIBUTING file the boilerplate text at
\<https://trustee.ietf.org/license-for-open-source-repositories.html>
from the IETF license file for open-source repositories. The
CONTRIBUTING file can contain other information as well (see
\<https://github.com/ietf/repo-files/tree/master/contributing-samples>
for examples).[¶](#section-3.1-1){.pilcrow}

It would be useful if the user data in the Datatracker could list (at a
minimum) the GitHub account of the user so that their contributions
could be tracked more easily.[¶](#section-3.1-2){.pilcrow}

Some working groups choose to have more than one draft in a repository,
particularly for drafts that are tightly linked with significant
cross-references. In such a case, the README for the repository needs to
say so clearly, so that a participant understands that changes might be
made to multiple drafts at once.[¶](#section-3.1-3){.pilcrow}
:::

::: {#backup}
::: {#section-3.2 .section}
### [3.2.](#section-3.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Backing Up and Archiving GitHub Content](#name-backing-up-and-archiving-gi){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-backing-up-and-archiving-gi}

IETF working group mailing lists are automatically backed up by the IETF
Secretariat, and the archives are publicly available. All official
interactions in a WG must be archived.[¶](#section-3.2-1){.pilcrow}

Working group GitHub content also needs to be backed up and publicly
archived. This document specifies using the Git protocol
\[[git-protocol](#git-protocol){.xref}\] itself for both of these
tasks.[¶](#section-3.2-2){.pilcrow}

Every IETF working group repository on GitHub will have a mirror
repository of the same name on a server maintained by the IETF
Secretariat. Every hour, a service will use the \"git fetch\" command on
every GitHub repository that is being tracked. The mirror repository
will allow anyone to read the repository.[¶](#section-3.2-3){.pilcrow}

Note that this system will not back up GitHub issues or pull requests.
These should be backed up as well; the GitHub API allows for this. The
IETF Secretariat should back up those at the same time as it is backing
up the GitHub repositories.[¶](#section-3.2-4){.pilcrow}

The steps in [Section 2.5](#repo_create){.xref} inform the IETF
Secretariat which repositories should be backed up. Working group chairs
and area directors should also be able to request that the IETF
Secretariat back up additional repositories that are related to IETF
working groups.[¶](#section-3.2-5){.pilcrow}

An attacker who can change the contents of Internet-Drafts, particularly
late in a working group\'s process, can possibly cause unnoticed changes
in protocols that are eventually adopted.[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

There is a risk of data loss due to centralization of data in one
service. This is recognized and mitigated by the plan described in
[Section 3.2](#backup){.xref}.[¶](#section-4-2){.pilcrow}
