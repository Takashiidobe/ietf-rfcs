# IPv6 Mesh over BLUETOOTH(R) Low Energy Using the Internet Protocol Support Profile (IPSP) {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

RFC 7668 describes the adaptation of IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless
Personal Area Network (6LoWPAN) techniques to enable IPv6 over Bluetooth
Low Energy (Bluetooth LE) networks that follow the star topology.
However, recent Bluetooth specifications allow the formation of extended
topologies as well. This document specifies mechanisms that are needed
to enable IPv6 mesh over Bluetooth LE links established by using the
Bluetooth Internet Protocol Support Profile (IPSP). This document does
not specify the routing protocol to be used in an IPv6 mesh over
Bluetooth LE links.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

Bluetooth Low Energy (hereinafter, Bluetooth LE) was first introduced in
the Bluetooth 4.0 specification. Bluetooth LE (which has been marketed
as Bluetooth Smart) is a low-power wireless technology designed for
short-range control and monitoring applications. Bluetooth LE is
currently implemented in a wide range of consumer electronics devices,
such as smartphones and wearable devices. Given the high potential of
this technology for the Internet of Things, the Bluetooth Special
Interest Group (Bluetooth SIG) and the IETF have produced specifications
in order to enable IPv6 over Bluetooth LE, such as the Internet Protocol
Support Profile (IPSP) \[[IPSP](#IPSP){.xref}\] and [RFC
7668](#RFC7668){.xref} \[[RFC7668](#RFC7668){.xref}\], respectively.
Bluetooth 4.0 only supports Bluetooth LE networks that follow the star
topology. As a consequence, [RFC 7668](#RFC7668){.xref}
\[[RFC7668](#RFC7668){.xref}\] was specifically developed and optimized
for that type of network topology. However, the functionality described
in [RFC 7668](#RFC7668){.xref} \[[RFC7668](#RFC7668){.xref}\] is not
sufficient and would fail to enable an IPv6 mesh over Bluetooth LE
links. This document specifies mechanisms that are needed to enable IPv6
mesh over Bluetooth LE links. This document does not specify the routing
protocol to be used in an IPv6 mesh over Bluetooth LE
links.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

Bluetooth LE defines two Generic Access Profile (GAP) roles of relevance
herein: the Bluetooth LE central role and the Bluetooth LE peripheral
role. In Bluetooth 4.0, a device in the central role, which is called
\"central\" from now on, was able to manage multiple simultaneous
connections with a number of devices in the peripheral role, called
\"peripherals\" hereinafter. Bluetooth 4.1 (now deprecated) introduced
the possibility for a peripheral to be connected to more than one
central simultaneously, therefore allowing extended topologies beyond
the star topology for a Bluetooth LE network
\[[BTCorev4.1](#BTCorev4.1){.xref}\]. In addition, a device may
simultaneously be a central in a set of link-layer connections, as well
as a peripheral in others.[¶](#section-2-1){.pilcrow}

On the other hand, the IPSP enables discovery of IP-enabled devices and
the establishment of a link-layer connection for transporting IPv6
packets. The IPSP defines the Node and Router roles for devices that
consume/originate IPv6 packets and for devices that can route IPv6
packets, respectively. Consistent with Bluetooth 4.1, Bluetooth 4.2
\[[BTCorev4.2](#BTCorev4.2){.xref}\], and subsequent Bluetooth versions,
a device may implement both roles
simultaneously.[¶](#section-2-2){.pilcrow}

This document assumes a mesh network composed of Bluetooth LE links,
where link-layer connections are established between neighboring
IPv6-enabled devices (see [Section 3.3.2, item 3.b,](#three-b){.xref}
and an example in [Appendix A](#Appendix){.xref}). The IPv6 forwarding
devices of the mesh have to implement both IPSP Node and Router roles,
while simpler leaf-only nodes can implement only the Node role. In an
IPv6 mesh over Bluetooth LE links, a node is a neighbor of another node,
and vice versa, if a link-layer connection has been established between
both by using the IPSP functionality for discovery and link-layer
connection establishment for IPv6 packet
transport.[¶](#section-2-3){.pilcrow}

[Figure 1](#fig_BLEMeshStack){.xref} illustrates the protocol stack for
IPv6 mesh over Bluetooth LE links. The core Bluetooth LE protocol stack
comprises two main sections: the Controller and the Host. The former
includes the Physical Layer and the Link Layer, whereas the latter is
composed of the Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol (L2CAP),
the Attribute Protocol (ATT), and the Generic Attribute Profile (GATT).
The Host and the Controller sections are connected by means of the
Host-Controller Interface (HCI). A device that supports the IPSP Node
role instantiates one Internet Protocol Support Service (IPSS), which
runs atop GATT. The protocol stack shown in [Figure
1](#fig_BLEMeshStack){.xref} shows two main differences with the IPv6
over Bluetooth LE stack in

[Figure 1](#figure-1){.selfRef}: [Protocol Stack for IPv6 Mesh over
Bluetooth LE Links](#name-protocol-stack-for-ipv6-mes){.selfRef}
:::

Bluetooth 4.2 defines a default MTU for Bluetooth LE of 251 bytes.
Excluding the L2CAP header of 4 bytes, a protocol data unit (PDU) size
of 247 bytes is available for the layer above L2CAP. (Note: Earlier
Bluetooth LE versions offered a maximum amount of 23 bytes for the layer
atop L2CAP.) The L2CAP provides a fragmentation and reassembly solution
for transmitting or receiving larger PDUs. At each link, the IPSP
defines means for negotiating a link-layer connection that provides an
MTU of 1280 octets or higher for the IPv6 layer
\[[IPSP](#IPSP){.xref}\]. As per the present specification, the MTU size
for IPv6 mesh over BLE links is 1280
octets.[¶](#section-3.1-4){.pilcrow}

Similarly to \[[RFC7668](#RFC7668){.xref}\], fragmentation functionality
from 6LoWPAN standards is not used for IPv6 mesh over Bluetooth LE
links. Bluetooth LE\'s fragmentation support provided by L2CAP is
used.[¶](#section-3.1-5){.pilcrow}

### [3.2.](#section-3.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Subnet Model](#name-subnet-model){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-subnet-model}

For IPv6 mesh over Bluetooth LE links, a multilink model has been
chosen, as further illustrated in [Figure 2](#fig_SubnetModel){.xref}.
As IPv6 over Bluetooth LE is intended for constrained nodes and for
Internet of Things use cases and environments, the complexity of
implementing a separate subnet on each peripheral-central link and
routing between the subnets appears to be excessive. In this
specification, the benefits of treating the collection of point-to-point
links between a central and its connected peripherals as a single
multilink subnet rather than a multiplicity of separate subnets are
considered to outweigh the multilink model\'s drawbacks as described in
\[[RFC4903](#RFC4903){.xref}\]. With the multilink subnet model, the
routers have to take on the responsibility of tracking the multicast
state and forwarding multicast in a loop-free manner. Note that the
route-over functionality defined in \[[RFC6775](#RFC6775){.xref}\] is
essential to enabling the multilink subnet model for IPv6 mesh over
Bluetooth LE links.[¶](#section-3.2-1){.pilcrow}

One or more 6LBRs are connected to the Internet. 6LNs are connected to
the network through a 6LR or a 6LBR. Note that in some scenarios and/or
for some time intervals, a 6LR may remain at the edge of the network
(e.g., the top left node in [Figure 2](#fig_SubnetModel){.xref}). This
may happen when a 6LR has no neighboring 6LNs. A single global unicast
prefix is used on the whole subnet.[¶](#section-3.2-3){.pilcrow}

The following aspects of the Neighbor Discovery optimizations for
6LoWPAN \[[RFC6775](#RFC6775){.xref}\] \[[RFC8505](#RFC8505){.xref}\]
are applicable to Bluetooth LE 6LNs:[¶](#section-3.3.2-2){.pilcrow}

1.  ::: {#section-3.3.2-3.1}
    A Bluetooth LE 6LN [MUST]{.bcp14} register its non-link-local
    addresses with its routers by sending a Neighbor Solicitation (NS)
    message with the Extended Address Registration Option (EARO) and
    process the Neighbor Advertisement (NA) accordingly. The EARO option
    includes a Registration Ownership Verifier (ROVR) field
    \[[RFC8505](#RFC8505){.xref}\]. In the case of Bluetooth LE, by
    default, the ROVR field is filled with the 48-bit device address
    used by the Bluetooth LE node converted into 64-bit Modified EUI-64
    format \[[RFC4291](#RFC4291){.xref}\]. Optionally, a cryptographic
    ID (see [RFC 8928](#RFC8928){.xref} \[[RFC8928](#RFC8928){.xref}\])
    [MAY]{.bcp14} be placed in the ROVR field. If a cryptographic ID is
    used, address registration and multihop DAD formats and procedures
    defined in \[[RFC8928](#RFC8928){.xref}\] [MUST]{.bcp14} be used
    unless an alternative mechanism offering equivalent protection is
    used.[¶](#section-3.3.2-3.1.1){.pilcrow}

    As per \[[RFC8505](#RFC8505){.xref}\], a 6LN link-local address does
    not need to be unique in the multilink subnet. A link-local address
    only needs to be unique from the perspective of the two nodes that
    use it to communicate (e.g., the 6LN and the 6LR in an NS/NA
    exchange). Therefore, the exchange of Extended Duplicate Address
    Request (EDAR) and Extended Duplicate Address Confirmation (EDAC)
    messages between the 6LR and a 6LBR, which ensures that an address
    is unique across the domain covered by the 6LBR, does not need to
    take place for link-local
    addresses.[¶](#section-3.3.2-3.1.2){.pilcrow}

    If the 6LN registers multiple addresses that are not based on the
    Bluetooth device address using the same compression context, the
    header compression efficiency may decrease, since only the last
    registered address can be fully elided (see [Section

#### [3.3.3.](#section-3.3.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Header Compression](#name-header-compression){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-header-compression}

Header compression as defined in RFC 6282
\[[RFC6282](#RFC6282){.xref}\], which specifies the compression format
for IPv6 datagrams on top of IEEE 802.15.4, is [REQUIRED]{.bcp14} as the
basis for IPv6 header compression on top of Bluetooth LE. All headers
[MUST]{.bcp14} be compressed according to RFC 6282
\[[RFC6282](#RFC6282){.xref}\] encoding
formats.[¶](#section-3.3.3-1){.pilcrow}

To enable efficient header compression, when the 6LBR sends a Router
Advertisement, it [MAY]{.bcp14} include a 6LoWPAN Context Option (6CO)
\[[RFC6775](#RFC6775){.xref}\] matching each address prefix advertised
via a Prefix Information Option (PIO) \[[RFC4861](#RFC4861){.xref}\] for
use in stateless address autoconfiguration. Note that 6CO is not needed
for context-based compression when the context is pre-provisioned or
provided by out-of-band means as, in these cases, the in-band indication
(6CO) becomes superfluous.[¶](#section-3.3.3-2){.pilcrow}

The specific optimizations of \[[RFC7668](#RFC7668){.xref}\] for header
compression, which exploited the star topology and Address Registration
Option (ARO) (note that the latter has been updated by EARO as per
\[[RFC8505](#RFC8505){.xref}\]), cannot be generalized in an IPv6 mesh
over Bluetooth LE links. Still, a subset of those optimizations can be
applied in some cases in such a network. These cases comprise link-local
interactions, non-link-local packet transmissions originated by a 6LN
(i.e., the first hop from a 6LN), and non-link-local packets intended
for a 6LN that are originated or forwarded by a neighbor of that 6LN
(i.e., the last hop toward a 6LN). For all other packet transmissions,
context-based compression [MAY]{.bcp14} be
used.[¶](#section-3.3.3-3){.pilcrow}

When a device transmits a packet to a neighbor, the sender
[MUST]{.bcp14} fully elide the source Interface Identifier (IID) if the
source IPv6 address is the link-local address based on the sender\'s
Bluetooth device address (SAC=0, SAM=11). The sender also [MUST]{.bcp14}
fully elide the destination IPv6 address if it is the link-local address
based on the neighbor\'s Bluetooth device address (DAC=0,
DAM=11).[¶](#section-3.3.3-4){.pilcrow}

When a 6LN transmits a packet with a non-link-local source address that
the 6LN has registered with EARO in the next-hop router for the
indicated prefix, the source address [MUST]{.bcp14} be fully elided if
it is the latest address that the 6LN has registered for the indicated
prefix (SAC=1, SAM=11). If the source non-link-local address is not the
latest registered by the 6LN and the first 48 bits of the IID match the
latest address are registered by the 6LN, then the last 16 bits of the
IID [SHALL]{.bcp14} be carried inline (SAC=1, SAM=10). Otherwise, if the
first 48 bits of the IID do not match, then the 64 bits of the IID
[SHALL]{.bcp14} be fully carried inline (SAC=1,
SAM=01).[¶](#section-3.3.3-5){.pilcrow}

When a router transmits a packet to a neighboring 6LN with a
non-link-local destination address, the router [MUST]{.bcp14} fully
elide the destination IPv6 address if the destination address is the
latest registered by the 6LN with EARO for the indicated context (DAC=1,
DAM=11). If the destination address is a non-link-local address and not
the latest registered and if the first 48 bits of the IID match those of
the latest registered address, then the last 16 bits of the IID
[SHALL]{.bcp14} be carried inline (DAC=1, DAM=10). Otherwise, if the
first 48 bits of the IID do not match, then the 64 bits of the IID

The Bluetooth LE Link Layer does not support multicast. Hence, traffic
is always unicast between two Bluetooth LE neighboring nodes. If a node
needs to send a multicast packet to several neighbors, it has to
replicate the packet and unicast it on each link. However, this may not
be energy efficient, and particular care must be taken if the node is
battery powered. A router (i.e., a 6LR or a 6LBR) [MUST]{.bcp14} keep
track of neighboring multicast listeners, and it [MUST NOT]{.bcp14}
forward multicast packets to neighbors that have not registered as
listeners for multicast groups to which the packets are
destined.[¶](#section-3.3.4-1){.pilcrow}

The security considerations in \[[RFC7668](#RFC7668){.xref}\]
apply.[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

IPv6 mesh over BLE requires a routing protocol to find end-to-end paths.
Unfortunately, the routing protocol may generate additional
opportunities for threats and attacks to the
network.[¶](#section-5-2){.pilcrow}

[RFC 7416](#RFC7416){.xref} \[[RFC7416](#RFC7416){.xref}\] provides a
systematic overview of threats and attacks on the IPv6 Routing Protocol
for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL), as well as countermeasures. In
that document, described threats and attacks comprise threats due to
failures to authenticate, threats due to failure to keep routing
information, threats and attacks on integrity, and threats and attacks
on availability. Reported countermeasures comprise confidentiality
attack, integrity attack, and availability attack
countermeasures.[¶](#section-5-3){.pilcrow}

While this specification does not state the routing protocol to be used
in IPv6 mesh over Bluetooth LE links, the guidance of
\[[RFC7416](#RFC7416){.xref}\] is useful when RPL is used in such
scenarios. Furthermore, such guidance may partly apply for other routing
protocols as well.[¶](#section-5-4){.pilcrow}

The ROVR can be derived from the Bluetooth device address. However, such
a ROVR can be spoofed; therefore, any node connected to the subnet and
aware of a registered-address-to-ROVR mapping could perform address
theft and impersonation attacks. Use of Address Protected Neighbor
Discovery \[[RFC8928](#RFC8928){.xref}\] provides protection against
such attacks.[¶](#section-5-5){.pilcrow}

## [Appendix A.](#appendix-A){.section-number .selfRef} [Bluetooth LE Connection Establishment Example](#name-bluetooth-le-connection-est){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-bluetooth-le-connection-est}

This appendix provides an example of Bluetooth LE connection
establishment and use of IPSP roles in an IPv6 mesh over BLE that uses
dynamic configuration. The example follows text in [Section 3.3.2, item
3.b](#three-b){.xref}.[¶](#appendix-A-1){.pilcrow}

The example assumes a network with one 6LBR, two 6LRs, and three 6LNs,
as shown in [Figure 3](#fig_Appendix){.xref}. Connectivity between the
6LNs and the 6LBR is only possible via the
6LRs.[¶](#appendix-A-2){.pilcrow}

The following text describes the different steps in the example as time
evolves. Note that other sequences of events that may lead to the same
final scenario are also possible.[¶](#appendix-A-3){.pilcrow}

At the beginning, the 6LBR starts running as an IPSP router, whereas the
rest of devices are not yet initialized ([Step 1](#step1){.xref}). Next,
the 6LRs start running as IPSP nodes, i.e., they use Bluetooth LE
advertisement packets to announce their presence and support of IPv6
capabilities ([Step 2](#step2){.xref}). The 6LBR (already running as an
IPSP router) discovers the presence of the 6LRs and establishes one
Bluetooth LE connection with each 6LR ([Step 3](#step3){.xref}). After
establishment of those link-layer connections (and after reception of
Router Advertisements from the 6LBR), the 6LRs start operating as
routers and also initiate the IPSP Router role ([Step
4](#step4){.xref}). (Note: whether the IPSP Node role is kept running
simultaneously is an implementation decision). Then, 6LNs start running
the IPSP Node role ([Step 5](#step5){.xref}). Finally, the 6LRs discover
the presence of the 6LNs and establish connections with the latter
([Step 6](#step6){.xref}).[¶](#appendix-A-4){.pilcrow}

## [Appendix B.](#appendix-B){.section-number .selfRef} [Node-Joining Procedure](#name-node-joining-procedure){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-node-joining-procedure}

This appendix provides a diagram that illustrates the node-joining
procedure. First of all, the joining node advertises its presence in
order to allow establishment of Bluetooth LE connections with neighbors
that already belong to a network. The neighbors typically run as a 6LR
or as a 6LBR. After Bluetooth LE connection establishment, the joining
node starts acting as a 6LN.[¶](#appendix-B-1){.pilcrow}

[Figure 4](#fig_AppendixB){.xref} shows the sequence of messages that
are exchanged by the 6LN and a neighboring 6LR that already belongs to
the network after the establishment of a Bluetooth LE connection between
both devices. Initially, the 6LN sends a Router Solicitation (RS)
message (1). Then, the 6LR replies with an RA, which includes the PIO
(2). After discovering the non-link-local prefix in use in the network,
the 6LN creates its non-link-local address and registers that address
with EARO (3) in the 6LR, and then multihop DAD is performed (4). The
next step is the transmission of the NA message sent by the 6LR in
response to the NS previously sent by the 6LN (5). If the non-link-local
address of the 6LN has been successfully validated, the 6LN can operate
as a member of the network it has joined.[¶](#appendix-B-2){.pilcrow}
