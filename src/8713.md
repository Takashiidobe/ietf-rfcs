## [1.](#section-1){.section-number .selfRef} [Introduction](#name-introduction){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-introduction}

This document is a revision of \[[RFC7437](#RFC7437){.xref}\] that
updates it to be consistent with the IETF Administrative Support
Activity (IASA) 2.0 changes. RFC 7437 was based on
\[[RFC3777](#RFC3777){.xref}\] that consolidated and updated other RFCs
that updated that document into a single specification. The result is a
complete specification of the process by which members of the Internet
Architecture Board (IAB) and Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG),
some Trustees of the IETF Trust, and some Directors of the IETF
Administration LLC (IETF LLC), are selected, confirmed, and
recalled.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

This revision addresses only the changes required for IASA 2.0; should
the community agree on other changes, they will be addressed in future
documents.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

[Section 2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8714#section-2){.relref}
of \[[RFC8714](#RFC8714){.xref}\] provides further details about the
IETF Trust Trustees positions that are filled by the IETF Nominating
Committee (NomCom).[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

[Section 5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8711#section-5){.relref}
of \[[RFC8711](#RFC8711){.xref}\] provides further details about the
IETF LLC Director positions that are filled by the
NomCom.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

The following two assumptions continue to be true of this
specification:[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}

1.  [The Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) and Internet Research
    Steering Group (IRSG) are not a part of the process described
    here.[¶](#section-1-6.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-6.1}
2.  [The organization (and reorganization) of the IESG is not a part of
    the process described
    here.[¶](#section-1-6.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-6.2}

The time frames specified here use IETF meetings as a frame of
reference. The time frames assume that the IETF meets three times per
calendar year with approximately equal amounts of time between them. The
meetings are referred to as the First IETF, Second IETF, or Third IETF
as needed.[¶](#section-1-7){.pilcrow}

The next section lists the words and phrases commonly used throughout
this document with their intended meaning.[¶](#section-1-8){.pilcrow}

The majority of this document is divided into four major topics as
follows:[¶](#section-1-9){.pilcrow}

General:
:   This is a set of rules and constraints that apply to the selection
    and confirmation process as a whole.[¶](#section-1-10.2){.pilcrow}

Nominating Committee Selection:
:   This is the process by which the volunteers who will serve on the
    NomCom are selected.[¶](#section-1-10.4){.pilcrow}

Nominating Committee Operation:
:   This is the set of principles, rules, and constraints that guide the
    activities of the NomCom, including the confirmation
    process.[¶](#section-1-10.6){.pilcrow}

Member, Trustee, and Director Recall:
:   This is the process by which the behavior of a sitting member of the
    IESG, or IAB, or IETF Trust Trustee, or IETF LLC Director may be
    questioned, perhaps resulting in the removal of the sitting member.
    See [Section 2](#defs){.xref} for a description of what a sitting
    member means for each of these groups.[¶](#section-1-10.8){.pilcrow}

A final section describes how this document differs from
\[[RFC3777](#RFC3777){.xref}\] and
\[[RFC7437](#RFC7437){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-11){.pilcrow}

An appendix of useful facts and practices collected from previous
NomComs is also included.[¶](#section-1-12){.pilcrow}

This document updates the IAB, IESG, and IAOC Selection, Confirmation,
and Recall Process to be aligned with IASA 2.0 Model
\[[RFC8711](#RFC8711){.xref}\] that creates an IETF Administration
Limited Liability Company (IETF LLC) managed by a Board of Directors
(IETF LLC Board). This document obsoletes \[[RFC7437](#RFC7437){.xref}\]
and \[[RFC8318](#RFC8318){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-13){.pilcrow}

    body.[¶](#section-2-2.4){.pilcrow}

Nominating Committee Term:
:   The term begins when its members are officially announced, which is
    expected to be prior to the Third IETF to ensure it is fully
    operational at the Third IETF. The term ends at the Third IETF (not
    three meetings) after the next NomCom\'s term
    begins.[¶](#section-2-2.6){.pilcrow}

necessary, a paragraph discussing the interpretation of each rule is
included.[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-3.1 .section}
### [3.1.](#section-3.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Completion Due](#name-completion-due){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-completion-due}

The completion of the annual process is due within seven
months.[¶](#section-3.1-1){.pilcrow}

The completion of the annual process is due one month prior to the
Friday of the week before the First IETF. It is expected to begin at
least eight months prior to the Friday of the week before the First
IETF.[¶](#section-3.1-2){.pilcrow}

The process officially begins with the announcement of the Chair of the
committee. The process officially ends when all confirmed candidates
have been announced.[¶](#section-3.1-3){.pilcrow}

The annual process is comprised of three major components as
follows:[¶](#section-3.1-4){.pilcrow}

1.  [The selection and organization of the NomCom
    members.[¶](#section-3.1-5.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.1-5.1}
2.  [The selection of candidates by the
    NomCom.[¶](#section-3.1-5.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.1-5.2}
3.  [The confirmation of the
    candidates.[¶](#section-3.1-5.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.1-5.3}

There is an additional month set aside between when the annual process
is expected to end and the term of the new candidates is to begin. This
time may be used during unusual circumstances to extend the time
allocated for any of the components listed
above.[¶](#section-3.1-6){.pilcrow}

### [3.2.](#section-3.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Nominating Committee Principal Functions](#name-nominating-committee-princi){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-nominating-committee-princi}

The principal functions of the NomCom are to review each open IESG, IAB,
IETF Trust, and IETF LLC Director position and to select either its
incumbent or a superior candidate.[¶](#section-3.2-1){.pilcrow}

Although there is no term limit for serving in any IESG, IAB, or IETF
Trust position, the NomCom may use length of service as one of its
criteria for evaluating an incumbent.[¶](#section-3.2-2){.pilcrow}

The NomCom does not select the open positions to be reviewed; it is
instructed as to which positions to review.[¶](#section-3.2-3){.pilcrow}

The NomCom will be given the titles of the positions to be reviewed and
a brief summary of the desired expertise of the candidate that is
selected to fill each position.[¶](#section-3.2-4){.pilcrow}

Incumbents must notify the NomCom if they wish to be
nominated.[¶](#section-3.2-5){.pilcrow}

The NomCom does not confirm its candidates; it presents its candidates
to the appropriate confirming body as indicated
below.[¶](#section-3.2-6){.pilcrow}

A superior candidate is one who the NomCom believes would contribute in
such a way as to improve or enhance the body to which he or she is
nominated.[¶](#section-3.2-7){.pilcrow}

### [3.3.](#section-3.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Positions to Be Reviewed](#name-positions-to-be-reviewed){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-positions-to-be-reviewed}

Approximately one-half of each of the then current IESG and IAB
positions, one IETF Trust position, and one IETF LLC Director position,
is selected to be reviewed each year.[¶](#section-3.3-1){.pilcrow}

The intent of this rule is to ensure the review of approximately
one-half of each of the IESG and IAB sitting members, one of the three
NomCom-nominated IETF LLC Director positions, and one of the three
nominated IETF Trust Trustee positions, each year. It is recognized that
circumstances may exist that will require the NomCom to review more or
less than the usual number of positions, e.g., if the IESG, IAB, IETF
Trust, or IETF LLC Board have reorganized prior to this process and
created new positions, if there are an odd number of current positions,
or if a member, a Director, or a Trustee unexpectedly
resigns.[¶](#section-3.3-2){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-3.4 .section}
### [3.4.](#section-3.4){.section-number .selfRef} [Term Lengths](#name-term-lengths){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-term-lengths}

Confirmed IESG and IAB candidates are expected to serve at least a
two-year term. The intent of this rule is to ensure that members of the
IESG and IAB serve the number of years that best facilitates the review
of one-half of the members each year.[¶](#section-3.4-1){.pilcrow}

Confirmed IETF LLC Director candidates are expected to serve at least a
three-year term, except if a nominating or selection body decides to use
a shorter term to allow for initial staggered appointments. Please refer
to [Section
6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8711#section-6){.relref} of
\[[RFC8711](#RFC8711){.xref}\] for additional guidance on term length
and term limits for the IETF LLC Board.[¶](#section-3.4-2){.pilcrow}

Confirmed IETF Trust Trustee candidates are expected to serve at least a
three-year term, except if a nominating or selection body decides to use
a shorter term to allow for initial staggered appointments. Please refer
to [Section
2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8714#section-2){.relref} of
\[[RFC8714](#RFC8714){.xref}\] for additional guidance on term length
and term limits for the IETF Trust.[¶](#section-3.4-3){.pilcrow}

The term of a confirmed candidate selected according to the mid-term
vacancy rules may be less than a full term (two years for IESG and IAB,
three years for the IETF Trust and IETF LLC), as stated elsewhere in
this document.[¶](#section-3.4-4){.pilcrow}

It is consistent with this rule for the NomCom to choose one or more of
the currently open positions to which it may assign a term of not more
than three years in order to ensure the ideal application of this rule
in the future.[¶](#section-3.4-5){.pilcrow}

It is consistent with this rule for the NomCom to choose one or more of
the currently open positions that share responsibilities with other
positions (both those being reviewed and those sitting) to which it may
assign a term of not more than three years to ensure that all such
members, Directors, or Trustees will not be reviewed at the same
time.[¶](#section-3.4-6){.pilcrow}

All sitting member terms end during the First IETF meeting corresponding
to the end of the term for which they were confirmed. All confirmed
candidate terms begin during the First IETF meeting corresponding to the
beginning of the term for which they were
confirmed.[¶](#section-3.4-7){.pilcrow}

For confirmed candidates of the IESG, the terms begin no later than when
the currently sitting members\' terms end on the last day of the
meeting. A term may begin or end no sooner than the first day of the
meeting and no later than the last day of the meeting as determined by
the mutual agreement of the currently sitting member and the confirmed
candidate. A confirmed candidate\'s term may overlap the sitting
member\'s term during the meeting as determined by their mutual
agreement.[¶](#section-3.4-8){.pilcrow}

For confirmed candidates of the IAB, the terms overlap with the terms of
the sitting members for the entire week of the
meeting.[¶](#section-3.4-9){.pilcrow}

For confirmed Trustee candidates of the IETF Trust, the term begins at
the next IETF Trust meeting or as dictated by the policies and
procedures of the IETF Trust.[¶](#section-3.4-10){.pilcrow}

For confirmed Director candidates of the IETF LLC, the term begins at
the next appropriate IETF LLC Board meeting or as dictated by the
policies and procedures of the IETF LLC
Board.[¶](#section-3.4-11){.pilcrow}

For candidates confirmed under the mid-term vacancy rules, the term
begins as soon as possible after the
confirmation.[¶](#section-3.4-12){.pilcrow}

Mid-term vacancies are filled by the same rules as documented here with
four qualifications, namely:[¶](#section-3.5-1){.pilcrow}

1.  [When there is only one official NomCom, the body with the mid-term
    vacancy relegates the responsibility to fill the vacancy to it. If
    the mid-term vacancy occurs during the period of time that the term
    of the prior year\'s NomCom overlaps with the term of the current
    year\'s NomCom, the body with the mid-term vacancy must relegate the
    responsibility to fill the vacancy to the prior year\'s
    NomCom.[¶](#section-3.5-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.5-2.1}

2.  [If it is the case that the NomCom is reconvening to fill the
    mid-term vacancy, then the completion of the candidate selection and
    confirmation process is due within six weeks, with all other time
    periods otherwise unspecified prorated
    accordingly.[¶](#section-3.5-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.5-2.2}

3.  [The confirming body has two weeks from the day it is notified of a
    candidate to reject the candidate, otherwise the candidate is
    assumed to have been
    confirmed.[¶](#section-3.5-2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.5-2.3}

4.  ::: {#section-3.5-2.4}
    The term of the confirmed candidate will be
    either:[¶](#section-3.5-2.4.1){.pilcrow}

    A.  [the remainder of the term of the open position if that
        remainder is not less than one year
        or[¶](#section-3.5-2.4.2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.5-2.4.2.1}
    B.  [the remainder of the term of the open position plus the next

### [3.6.](#section-3.6){.section-number .selfRef} [Confidentiality](#name-confidentiality){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-confidentiality}

All deliberations and supporting information that relate to specific
nominees, candidates, and confirmed candidates are
confidential.[¶](#section-3.6-1){.pilcrow}

The NomCom and confirming body members will be exposed to confidential
information as a result of their deliberations, their interactions with
those they consult, and from those who provide requested supporting
information. All members and all other participants are expected to
handle this information in a manner consistent with its
sensitivity.[¶](#section-3.6-2){.pilcrow}

It is consistent with this rule for current NomCom members who have
served on prior NomComs to advise the current committee on deliberations
and results of the prior committee, as necessary and
appropriate.[¶](#section-3.6-3){.pilcrow}

The list of nominees willing to be considered for positions under review
in the current NomCom cycle is not confidential. The NomCom may disclose
a list of names of nominees who are willing to be considered for
positions under review to the community, in order to obtain feedback
from the community on these nominees.[¶](#section-3.6-4){.pilcrow}

The list of nominees disclosed for a specific position should contain
only the names of nominees who are willing to be considered for the
position under review.[¶](#section-3.6-5){.pilcrow}

The NomCom may choose not to include some names in the disclosed list,
at their discretion.[¶](#section-3.6-6){.pilcrow}

The NomCom may disclose an updated list, at its discretion. For example,
the NomCom might disclose an updated list if it identifies
errors/omissions in a previously disclosed version of the disclosed
list, or if the NomCom finds it necessary to call for additional
nominees, and these nominees indicate a willingness to be considered
before the NomCom has completed its
deliberations.[¶](#section-3.6-7){.pilcrow}

Nominees may choose to ask people to provide feedback to the NomCom but
should not encourage any public statements of support. NomComs should
consider nominee-encouraged lobbying and campaigning to be unacceptable
behavior.[¶](#section-3.6-8){.pilcrow}

IETF community members are encouraged to provide feedback on nominees to
the NomCom but should not post statements of support/non-support for
nominees in any public forum.[¶](#section-3.6-9){.pilcrow}

A confirming body decides whether it confirms each candidate using a
confirmation decision rule chosen by the confirming
body.[¶](#section-3.7.4-1){.pilcrow}

If a confirming body has no specific confirmation decision rule, then
confirming a given candidate should require at least one-half of the
confirming body\'s sitting members to agree to that
confirmation.[¶](#section-3.7.4-2){.pilcrow}

consensus based on informal exchanges (e.g., email), or by any other
mechanism that is used to conduct the normal business of the confirming
body.[¶](#section-3.7.4-3){.pilcrow}

Regardless of which decision rule the confirming body uses, any
candidate that is not confirmed under that rule is considered to be
rejected.[¶](#section-3.7.4-4){.pilcrow}

### [3.8.](#section-3.8){.section-number .selfRef} [Sitting Members, Directors, and Trustees](#name-sitting-members-directors-a){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-sitting-members-directors-a}

The following rules apply to nominees and candidates who are currently
sitting members of the IESG or IAB, IETF Trust Trustees, or IETF LLC
Directors, and who are not sitting in an open position being filled by
the NomCom.[¶](#section-3.8-1){.pilcrow}

The confirmation of a candidate to an open position does not
automatically create a vacancy in the IESG, IAB, IETF Trust, or IETF LLC
Board position currently occupied by the candidate. The mid-term vacancy
cannot exist until, first, the candidate formally resigns from the
current position and, second, the body with the vacancy formally decides
for itself that it wants the NomCom to fill the mid-term vacancy
according to the rules for a mid-term vacancy documented elsewhere in
this document.[¶](#section-3.8-2){.pilcrow}

The resignation should be effective as of when the term of the new
position begins. The resignation may remain confidential to the IESG,
IAB, IETF Trust, IETF LLC Board, and NomCom until the confirmed
candidate is announced for the new position. The process, according to
rules set out elsewhere in this document, of filling the seat vacated by
the confirmed candidate may begin as soon as the vacancy is publicly
announced.[¶](#section-3.8-3){.pilcrow}

Filling a mid-term vacancy is a separate and independent action from the

complete its job with respect to filling the open positions and then

However, the following exception is permitted in the case where the
candidate for an open position is currently a sitting member of the IAB.
It is consistent with these rules for the announcements of a resignation
of a sitting member of the IAB and of the confirmed candidate for the
mid-term vacancy created by that sitting member on the IAB to all occur
at the same time as long as the actual sequence of events that occurred
did so in the following order:[¶](#section-3.8-5){.pilcrow}

The term of a NomCom is expected to be 15
months.[¶](#section-4.2-1){.pilcrow}

It is the intent of this rule that the end of a NomCom\'s term overlap
by approximately three months the beginning of the term of the next
NomCom.[¶](#section-4.2-2){.pilcrow}

The term of a NomCom begins when its members are officially announced.
The term ends at the Third IETF (not three meetings), i.e., the IETF
meeting after the next NomCom\'s term
begins.[¶](#section-4.2-3){.pilcrow}

A term is expected to begin at least two months prior to the Third IETF
to ensure the NomCom has at least one month to get organized before
preparing for the Third IETF.[¶](#section-4.2-4){.pilcrow}

A NomCom is expected to complete any work in progress before it is
dissolved at the end of its term.[¶](#section-4.2-5){.pilcrow}

During the period of time when the terms of the NomComs overlap, all
mid-term vacancies are to be relegated to the prior year\'s NomCom. The
prior year\'s NomCom has no other responsibilities during the overlap
period. At all times other than the overlap period, there is exactly one
official NomCom and it is responsible for all mid-term
vacancies.[¶](#section-4.2-6){.pilcrow}

When the prior year\'s NomCom is filling a mid-term vacancy during the
period of time that the terms overlap, the NomComs operate
independently. However, some coordination is needed between them. Since
the prior year\'s Chair is a non-voting advisor to the current NomCom,
the coordination is expected to be
straightforward.[¶](#section-4.2-7){.pilcrow}

selection and confirmation process.[¶](#section-5.4-1){.pilcrow}

There is a defined time period during which the candidate selection and
confirmation process must be completed. The Chair must establish a set
of milestones that, if met in a timely fashion, will result in the
completion of the process on time. The Chair should allow time for
iterating the activities of the committee if one or more candidates are
not confirmed.[¶](#section-5.4-2){.pilcrow}

Only voting volunteers vote on a candidate selection. For a candidate
selection vote, a quorum is comprised of at least seven of the voting
volunteers.[¶](#section-5.6-2){.pilcrow}

Any member of the NomCom may propose to the committee that any other
member except the Chair be recalled. The process for recalling the Chair
is defined elsewhere in this document.[¶](#section-5.7-1){.pilcrow}

There are a variety of ordinary circumstances that may arise that could
result in one or more members of the committee being unavailable to
complete their assigned duties, for example, health concerns, family
issues, or a change of priorities at work. A committee member may choose
to resign for unspecified personal reasons. In addition, the committee
may not function well as a group because a member may be disruptive or
otherwise uncooperative.[¶](#section-5.7-2){.pilcrow}

Regardless of the circumstances, if individual committee members cannot
work out their differences between themselves, the entire committee may
be called upon to discuss and review the circumstances. If a resolution
is not forthcoming, a vote may be conducted. A member may be recalled if
at least a quorum of all committee members agree, including the vote of
the member being recalled.[¶](#section-5.7-3){.pilcrow}

If a liaison member is recalled, the committee must notify the affected
organization and must allow a reasonable amount of time for a
replacement to be identified by the organization before
proceeding.[¶](#section-5.7-4){.pilcrow}

If an advisor member other than the prior year\'s Chair is recalled, the
committee may choose to proceed without the advisor. In the case of the
prior year\'s Chair, the Internet Society President must be notified and
the current Chair must be allowed a reasonable amount of time to consult
with the Internet Society President to identify a replacement before
proceeding.[¶](#section-5.7-5){.pilcrow}

If a single voting volunteer position on the NomCom is vacated,
regardless of the circumstances, the committee may choose to proceed
with only nine voting volunteers at its own discretion. In all other
cases, a new voting member must be selected, and the Chair must repeat
the random selection process including an announcement of the iteration
prior to the actual selection as stated elsewhere in this
document.[¶](#section-5.7-6){.pilcrow}

A change in the primary affiliation of a voting volunteer during the
term of the NomCom is not a cause to request the recall of that
volunteer, even if the change would result in more than two voting
volunteers with the same affiliation.[¶](#section-5.7-7){.pilcrow}

It is the responsibility of the prior year\'s Chair to ensure the
current Chair completes the assigned tasks in a manner consistent with
this document and in the best interests of the IETF
community.[¶](#section-5.8-2){.pilcrow}

Any member of the committee who has an issue or concern regarding the
Chair should report it to the prior year\'s Chair immediately. The prior
year\'s Chair is expected to report it to the Chair immediately. If they
cannot resolve the issue between themselves, the prior year\'s Chair

confirmed by the NomCom.[¶](#section-5.11-1){.pilcrow}

A self-nomination is permitted.[¶](#section-5.11-2){.pilcrow}

The NomCom selects candidates based on its understanding of the IETF
community\'s consensus of the qualifications required to fill the open
positions.[¶](#section-5.12-1){.pilcrow}

The intent of this rule is to ensure that the NomCom consults with a
broad base of the IETF community for input to its deliberations. In
particular, the NomCom must determine if the desired expertise for the
open positions matches its understanding of the qualifications desired
by the IETF community.[¶](#section-5.12-2){.pilcrow}

The consultations are permitted to include names of nominees, if all
parties to the consultation agree to observe the same confidentiality
rules as the NomCom itself, or the names are public as discussed in
[Section 3.6](#gen_confidential){.xref}. Feedback on individual nominees
should always be confidential.[¶](#section-5.12-3){.pilcrow}

A broad base of the community should include the existing members of the
IESG and IAB, IETF Trust Trustees, and IETF LLC Directors, especially
sitting members who share responsibilities with open positions, e.g.,
co-Area Directors, and working group chairs, especially those in the
areas with open positions.[¶](#section-5.12-4){.pilcrow}

consent to their nomination prior to being chosen as
candidates.[¶](#section-5.13-1){.pilcrow}

Although the NomCom will make every reasonable effort to contact and to
remain in contact with nominees, any nominee whose contact information
changes during the process and who wishes to still be considered should
inform the NomCom of the changes.[¶](#section-5.13-2){.pilcrow}

position and an assurance that the nominee will perform the duties of
the position for which they are being considered in the best interests
of the IETF community.[¶](#section-5.13-3){.pilcrow}

Consenting to a nomination must occur prior to a nominee being a

## [Appendix C.](#section-appendix.c){.section-number .selfRef} [Oral Tradition](#name-oral-tradition){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-oral-tradition}

Over the years, various NomComs have learned through oral tradition
passed on by liaisons that there are certain consistencies in the
process and information considered during deliberations. Some items from
that oral tradition are collected here to facilitate its consideration
by future NomComs.[¶](#section-appendix.c-1){.pilcrow}

1.  [It has been found that experience as an IETF Working Group Chair or
    an IRTF Research Group Chair is helpful in giving a nominee
    experience of what the job of an Area Director involves. It also
    helps a NomCom judge the technical, people, and process management
    skills of the
    nominee.[¶](#section-appendix.c-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-appendix.c-2.1}
2.  [No person should serve both on the IAB and as an Area Director,
    except the IETF Chair whose roles as an IAB member and Area Director
    of the General Area are set out
    elsewhere.[¶](#section-appendix.c-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-appendix.c-2.2}
3.  [The strength of the IAB is found in part in the balance of the
    demographics of its members (e.g., national distribution, years of
    experience, gender, etc.), the combined skill set of its members,
    and the combined sectors (e.g., industry, academia, etc.)
    represented by its
    members.[¶](#section-appendix.c-2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-appendix.c-2.3}
4.  [There are no term limits for IAB and IESG members explicitly
    because the issue of continuity versus turnover should be evaluated
    each year according to the expectations of the IETF community, as it
    is understood by each
    NomCom.[¶](#section-appendix.c-2.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-appendix.c-2.4}
5.  [The number of NomCom members with the same primary affiliation is
    limited in order to avoid the appearance of improper bias in
    choosing the leadership of the IETF. Rather than defining precise
    rules for how to define \"affiliation\", the IETF community depends
    on the honor and integrity of the participants to make the process
    work.[¶](#section-appendix.c-2.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-appendix.c-2.5}

## [Appendix D.](#section-appendix.d){.section-number .selfRef} [Nominating Committee Timeline](#name-nominating-committee-timeli){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-nominating-committee-timeli}

This appendix is included for the convenience of the reader and is not
to be interpreted as the definitive timeline. It is intended to capture
the detail described elsewhere in this document in one place. Although
every effort has been made to ensure the description here is consistent
with the description elsewhere, if there are any conflicts the
definitive rule is the one in the main body of this
document.[¶](#section-appendix.d-1){.pilcrow}

The only absolute in the timeline rules for the annual process is that
its completion is due by the First IETF of the year after the NomCom
begins its term. This is supported by the fact that the confirmed
candidate terms begin during the week of the First
IETF.[¶](#section-appendix.d-2){.pilcrow}

The overall annual process is designed to be completed in seven months.
It is expected to start nine months prior to the First IETF. The time is
split between three major components of the process roughly as
follows:[¶](#section-appendix.d-3){.pilcrow}

1.  [First is the selection and organization of the committee members.
    Three months are allotted for this
    process.[¶](#section-appendix.d-4.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-appendix.d-4.1}
2.  [Second is the selection of the candidates by the NomCom. Four
    months are allotted for this
    process.[¶](#section-appendix.d-4.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-appendix.d-4.2}
3.  [Third is the confirmation of the candidates by their respective
    confirming bodies. Two months are allotted for this
    process.[¶](#section-appendix.d-4.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-appendix.d-4.3}

The following list captures the details of the milestones within each
component. For illustrative purposes, the list presumes the Friday
before the First IETF is March 1. Numbers shown in square brackets
indicate the expected number of weeks at each
step.[¶](#section-appendix.d-5){.pilcrow}

1.  [BEGIN Eight Months Prior to First IETF (approx. June 1); Internet
    Society President appoints the Chair. The appointment must be done
    no later than the Second IETF or eight months prior to the First
    IETF, whichever comes first. The Chair must be announced and
    recognized during a plenary session of the Second IETF.
