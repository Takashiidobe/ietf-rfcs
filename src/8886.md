# RFC 8886 {#rfcnum}

# Secure Device Install {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

Deploying a new network device in a location where the operator has no
staff of its own often requires that an employee physically travel to
the location to perform the initial install and configuration, even in
shared facilities with \"remote-hands\" (or similar) support. In many
cases, this could be avoided if there were an easy way to transfer the
initial configuration to a new device while still maintaining
confidentiality of the configuration.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

This document extends existing vendor proprietary auto-install to
provide limited confidentiality to initial configuration during
bootstrapping of the device.[¶](#section-abstract-2){.pilcrow}

## [1.](#section-1){.section-number .selfRef} [Introduction](#name-introduction){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-introduction}

In a growing, global network, significant amounts of time and money are
spent deploying new devices and \"forklift\" upgrading existing devices.
In many cases, these devices are in shared facilities (for example,
Internet Exchange Points (IXP) or \"carrier-neutral data centers\"),
which have staff on hand that can be contracted to perform tasks
including physical installs, device reboots, loading initial
configurations, etc. There are also a number of (often proprietary)
protocols to perform initial device installs and configurations. For
example, many network devices will attempt to use DHCP
\[[RFC2131](#RFC2131){.xref}\] or DHCPv6 \[[RFC8415](#RFC8415){.xref}\]
to get an IP address and configuration server and then fetch and install
a configuration when they are first powered
on.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

The configurations of network devices contain a significant amount of
security-related and proprietary information (for example, RADIUS
\[[RFC2865](#RFC2865){.xref}\] or TACACS+
\[[TACACS](#I-D.ietf-opsawg-tacacs){.xref}\] secrets). Exposing these to
a third party to load onto a new device (or using an auto-install
technique that fetches an unencrypted configuration file via TFTP
\[[RFC1350](#RFC1350){.xref}\]) or something similar is an unacceptable
security risk for many operators, and so they send employees to remote
locations to perform the initial configuration work; this costs time and
money.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

There are some workarounds to this, such as asking the vendor to
preconfigure the device before shipping it; asking the remote support to
install a terminal server; providing a minimal, unsecured configuration
and using that to bootstrap to a complete configuration; etc. However,
these are often clumsy and have security issues. As an example, in the
terminal server case, the console port connection could be easily
snooped.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

An ideal solution in this space would protect both the confidentiality
of device configuration in transit and the authenticity (and
authorization status) of configuration to be used by the device. The
mechanism described in this document only addresses the former and makes
no effort to do the latter, with the device accepting any configuration
file that comes its way and is encrypted to the device\'s key (or not
encrypted, as the case may be). Other solutions (such as [Secure Zero
Touch Provisioning (SZTP)](#RFC8572){.xref}
\[[RFC8572](#RFC8572){.xref}\], [Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key
Infrastructures (BRSKI)](#I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra){.xref}
\[[BRSKI](#I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra){.xref}\], and other
voucher-based methods) are more fully featured but also require more
complicated machinery. This document describes something much simpler,
at the cost of only providing limited
protection.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

This document layers security onto existing auto-install solutions (one
example of which is \[[Cisco_AutoInstall](#Cisco_AutoInstall){.xref}\])
to provide a method to initially configure new devices while maintaining
(limited) confidentiality of the initial configuration. It is optimized
for simplicity, for both the implementor and the operator. It is
explicitly not intended to be a fully featured system for managing
installed devices nor is it intended to solve all use cases; rather, it
is a simple targeted solution to solve a common operational issue where
the network device has been delivered, fiber has been laid (as
appropriate), and there is no trusted member of the operator\'s staff to
perform the initial configuration. This solution is only intended to
increase confidentiality of the information in the configuration file
and does not protect the device itself from loading a malicious
configuration.[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}

This document describes a concept and some example ways of implementing
this concept. As devices have different capabilities and use different
configuration paradigms, one method will not suit all, and so it is
expected that vendors will differ in exactly how they implement
this.[¶](#section-1-6){.pilcrow}

This solution is specifically designed to be a simple method on top of
exiting device functionality. If devices do not support this new method,
they can continue to use the existing functionality. In addition,
operators can choose to use this to protect their configuration
information or can continue to use the existing
functionality.[¶](#section-1-7){.pilcrow}

The issue of securely installing devices is in no way a new issue nor is
it limited to network devices; it occurs when deploying servers, PCs,
Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and in many other situations. While
the solution described in this document is obvious (encrypt the config,
then decrypt it with a device key), this document only discusses the use
for network devices, such as routers and
switches.[¶](#section-1-8){.pilcrow}
:::

::: {#section-2 .section}
## [2.](#section-2){.section-number .selfRef} [Overview](#name-overview){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-overview}

Most network devices already include some sort of initial bootstrapping
logic (sometimes called \'autoboot\' or \'autoinstall\'). This generally
works by having a newly installed, unconfigured device obtain an IP
address for itself and discover the address of a configuration server
(often called \'next-server\', \'siaddr\', or \'tftp-server-name\')
using DHCP or DHCPv6 (see \[[RFC2131](#RFC2131){.xref}\] and
\[[RFC8415](#RFC8415){.xref}\]). The device then contacts this
configuration server to download its initial configuration, which is
often identified using the device\'s serial number, Media Access Control
(MAC) address, or similar. This document extends this (vendor-specific)
paradigm by allowing the configuration file to be
encrypted.[¶](#section-2-1){.pilcrow}

This document uses the serial number of the device as a unique device
identifier for simplicity; some vendors may not want to implement the
system using the serial number as the identifier for business reasons (a
competitor or similar could enumerate the serial numbers and determine
how many devices have been manufactured). Implementors are free to
choose some other way of generating identifiers (e.g., a Universally
Unique Identifier (UUID) \[[RFC4122](#RFC4122){.xref}\]), but this will
likely make it somewhat harder for operators to use (the serial number
is usually easy to find on a device).[¶](#section-2-2){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-2.1 .section}
### [2.1.](#section-2.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Example Scenario](#name-example-scenario){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-example-scenario}

Operator_A needs another peering router, and so they order another
router from Vendor_B to be drop-shipped to the facility. Vendor_B begins
assembling the new device and tells Operator_A what the new device\'s
serial number will be (SN:17894321). When Vendor_B first installs the
firmware on the device and boots it, the device generates a
public-private key pair, and Vendor_B publishes the public key on its
key server (in a public key certificate, for ease of
use).[¶](#section-2.1-1){.pilcrow}

While the device is being shipped, Operator_A generates the initial
device configuration and fetches the certificate from Vendor_B key
servers by providing the serial number of the new device. Operator_A
then encrypts the device configuration and puts this encrypted
configuration on a (local) TFTP server.[¶](#section-2.1-2){.pilcrow}

When the device arrives at the Point of Presence (POP), it gets
installed in Operator_A\'s rack and cabled as instructed. The new device
powers up and discovers that it has not yet been configured. It enters
its autoboot state and begins the DHCP process. Operator_A\'s DHCP
server provides it with an IP address and the address of the
configuration server. The router uses TFTP to fetch its configuration
file. Note that all of this is existing functionality. The device
attempts to load the configuration file. As an added step, if the
configuration file cannot be parsed, the device tries to use its private
key to decrypt the file and, assuming it validates, proceeds to install
the new, decrypted configuration.[¶](#section-2.1-3){.pilcrow}

Only the \"correct\" device will have the required private key and be
able to decrypt and use the configuration file (see [Security
Considerations](#security){.xref} ([Section 7](#security){.xref})). An
attacker would be able to connect to the network and get an IP address.
They would also be able to retrieve (encrypted) configuration files by
guessing serial numbers (or perhaps the server would allow directory
listing), but without the private keys, an attacker will not be able to
decrypt the files.[¶](#section-2.1-4){.pilcrow}

## [3.](#section-3){.section-number .selfRef} [Vendor Role](#name-vendor-role){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-vendor-role}

This section describes the vendor\'s roles and provides an overview of
what the device needs to do.[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-3.1 .section}
### [3.1.](#section-3.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Device Key Generation](#name-device-key-generation){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-device-key-generation}

Each device requires a public-private key pair and for the public part
to be published and retrievable by the operator. The cryptographic
algorithm and key lengths to be used are out of the scope of this
document. This section illustrates one method, but, as with much of this
document, the exact mechanism may vary by vendor. Enrollment over Secure
Transport \[[RFC7030](#RFC7030){.xref}\] and possibly the Simple
Certificate Enrollment Protocol \[[RFC8894](#RFC8894){.xref}\] are
methods that vendors may want to consider.[¶](#section-3.1-1){.pilcrow}

During the manufacturing stage, when the device is initially powered on,
it will generate a public-private key pair. It will send its unique
device identifier and the public key to the vendor\'s directory server
\[[RFC5280](#RFC5280){.xref}\] to be published. The vendor\'s directory
server should only accept certificates that are from the manufacturing
facility and that match vendor-defined policies (for example, extended
key usage and extensions). Note that some devices may be constrained and
so may send the raw public key and unique device identifier to the
certificate publication server, while more capable devices may generate
and send self-signed certificates. This communication with the directory
server should be integrity protected and should occur in a controlled
environment.[¶](#section-3.1-2){.pilcrow}

This reference architecture needs a serialization format for the key
material. Due to the prevalence of tooling support for it on network
devices, X.509 certificates are a convenient format to exchange public
keys. However, most of the metadata that would be used for revocation
and aging will not be used and should be ignored by both the client and
server. In such cases, the signature on the certificate conveys no
value, and the consumer of the certificate is expected to pin the
end-entity key fingerprint (versus using a PKI and signature
chain).[¶](#section-3.1-3){.pilcrow}
:::

::: {#section-3.2 .section}
### [3.2.](#section-3.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Directory Server](#name-directory-server){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-directory-server}

The directory server contains a database of certificates. If newly
manufactured devices upload certificates, the directory server can
simply publish these; if the devices provide the raw public keys and
unique device identifier, the directory server will need to wrap these
in a certificate.[¶](#section-3.2-1){.pilcrow}

The customers (e.g., Operator_A) query this server with the serial
number (or other provided unique identifier) of a device and retrieve
the associated certificate. It is expected that operators will receive
the unique device identifier (serial number) of devices when they
purchase them and will download and store the certificate. This means
that there is not a hard requirement on the reachability of the
directory server.[¶](#section-3.2-2){.pilcrow}

The operator will contact the vendor\'s publication server and download
the certificate (by providing the unique device identifier of the
device). The operator fetches the certificate using a secure transport
that authenticates the source of the certificate, such as HTTPS
(confidentiality protection can provide some privacy and
metadata-leakage benefit but is not key to the primary mechanism of this
document). The operator will then encrypt the initial configuration (for
example, using S/MIME \[[RFC8551](#RFC8551){.xref}\]) using the key in
the certificate and place it on their configuration
server.[¶](#section-4.2-1){.pilcrow}

### [4.3.](#section-4.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Example Initial Customer Boot](#name-example-initial-customer-bo){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-example-initial-customer-bo}

When the device is first booted by the customer (and on subsequent
boots), if the device does not have a valid configuration, it will use
existing auto-install functionality. As an example, it performs DHCP
Discovery until it gets a DHCP offer including DHCP option 66
(Server-Name) or 150 (TFTP server address), contacts the server listed
in these DHCP options, and downloads its configuration file. Note that
this is existing functionality (for example, Cisco devices fetch the
config file named by the Bootfile-Name DHCP option
(67)).[¶](#section-4.3-1){.pilcrow}

After retrieving the configuration file, the device needs to determine
if it is encrypted or not. If it is not encrypted, the existing behavior
is used. If the configuration is encrypted, the process continues as
described in this document. If the device has been configured to only
support encrypted configuration and determines that the configuration
file is not encrypted, it should abort. The method used to determine if
the configuration is encrypted or not is implementation dependent; there
are a number of (obvious) options, including having a magic string in
the file header, using a file name extension (e.g., config.enc), or
using specific DHCP options.[¶](#section-4.3-2){.pilcrow}

If the file is encrypted, the device will attempt to decrypt and parse
the file. If able, it will install the configuration and start using it.
If it cannot decrypt the file or if parsing the configuration fails, the
device will either abort the auto-install process or repeat this process
until it succeeds. When retrying, care should be taken to not overwhelm
the server hosting the encrypted configuration files. It is suggested
that the device retry every 5 minutes for the first hour and then every
hour after that. As it is expected that devices may be installed well
before the configuration file is ready, a maximum number of retries is
not specified.[¶](#section-4.3-3){.pilcrow}

Note that the device only needs to be able to download the configuration
file; after the initial power on in the factory, it never needs to
access the Internet, vendor, or directory server. The device (and only
the device) has the private key and so has the ability to decrypt the
configuration file.[¶](#section-4.3-4){.pilcrow}

### [5.1.](#section-5.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Key Storage](#name-key-storage){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-key-storage}

Ideally, the key pair would be stored in a Trusted Platform Module (TPM)
on something that is identified as the \"router\" \-- for example, the
chassis/backplane. This is so that a key pair is bound to what humans
think of as the \"device\" and not, for example, (redundant) routing
engines. Devices that implement IEEE 802.1AR
\[[IEEE802-1AR](#IEEE802-1AR){.xref}\] could choose to use the Initial
Device Identifier (IDevID) for this
purpose.[¶](#section-5.1-1){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-5.2 .section}
### [5.2.](#section-5.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Key Replacement](#name-key-replacement){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-key-replacement}

It is anticipated that some operator may want to replace the
(vendor-provided) keys after installing the device. There are two
options when implementing this: a vendor could allow the operator\'s key
to completely replace the initial device-generated key (which means
that, if the device is ever sold, the new owner couldn\'t use this
technique to install the device), or the device could prefer the
operator\'s installed key. This is an implementation decision left to
the vendor.[¶](#section-5.2-1){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-5.3 .section}
### [5.3.](#section-5.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Device Reinstall](#name-device-reinstall){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-device-reinstall}

Increasingly, operations are moving towards an automated model of device
management, whereby portions of the configuration (or the entire
configuration) are programmatically generated. This means that operators
may want to generate an entire configuration after the device has been
initially installed and ask the device to load and use this new
configuration. It is expected (but not defined in this document, as it
is vendor specific) that vendors will allow the operator to copy a new,
encrypted configuration (or part of a configuration) onto a device and
then request that the device decrypt and install it (e.g., \'load
replace \<filename> encrypted\'). The operator could also choose to
reset the device to factory defaults and allow the device to act as
though it were the initial boot (see [Section
4.3](#initial_cust_boot){.xref}).[¶](#section-5.3-1){.pilcrow}

## [7.](#section-7){.section-number .selfRef} [Security Considerations](#name-security-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-security-considerations}

This reference architecture is intended to incrementally improve upon
commonly accepted \"auto-install\" practices used today that may
transmit configurations unencrypted (e.g., unencrypted configuration
files that can be downloaded connecting to unprotected ports in data
centers, mailing initial configuration files on flash drives, or
emailing configuration files and asking a third party to copy and paste
them over a serial terminal) or allow unrestricted access to these
configurations.[¶](#section-7-1){.pilcrow}

This document describes an object-level security design to provide
confidentiality assurances for the configuration stored at rest on the
configuration server and for configuration while it is in transit
between the configuration server and the unprovisioned device, even if
the underlying transport does not provide this security
service.[¶](#section-7-2){.pilcrow}

The architecture provides no assurances about the source of the
encrypted configuration or protect against theft and reuse of
devices.[¶](#section-7-3){.pilcrow}

An attacker (e.g., a malicious data center employee, person in the
supply chain, etc.) who has physical access to the device before it is
connected to the network or who manages to exploit it once installed may
be able to extract the device private key (especially if it is not
stored in a TPM), pretend to be the device when connecting to the
network, and download and extract the (encrypted) configuration
file.[¶](#section-7-4){.pilcrow}

An attacker with access to the configuration server (or the ability to
route traffic to configuration server under their control) and the
device\'s public key could return a configuration of the attacker\'s
choosing to the unprovisioned device.[¶](#section-7-5){.pilcrow}

This mechanism does not protect against a malicious vendor. While the
key pair should be generated on the device and the private key should be
securely stored, the mechanism cannot detect or protect against a vendor
who claims to do this but instead generates the key pair off device and
keeps a copy of the private key. It is largely understood in the
operator community that a malicious vendor or attacker with physical
access to the device is largely a \"Game Over\"
situation.[¶](#section-7-6){.pilcrow}

Even when using a secure bootstrap mechanism, security-conscious
operators may wish to bootstrap devices with a minimal or less-sensitive
configuration and then replace this with a more complete one after
install.[¶](#section-7-7){.pilcrow}

automated would be used. In this example, the unique device identifier

They generate the initial configuration (using whatever magic tool
generates router configs!), fetch the router\'s certificate, and encrypt
the configuration file to that key. This is done by the

When the router connects to the operator\'s network, it will detect that
it does not have a valid configuration file and will start the
\"autoboot\" process. This is a well-documented process, but the
high-level overview is that it will use DHCP to obtain an IP address and
configuration server. It will then use TFTP to download a configuration
file, based upon its serial number (this document modifies the solution
to fetch an encrypted configuration file (ending in .enc)). It will then
decrypt the configuration file and install
it.[¶](#section-a.3-1){.pilcrow}
