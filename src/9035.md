## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

This document updates RFC 8138 by defining a bit in the Routing Protocol
for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) Destination-Oriented Directed
Acyclic Graph (DODAG) Configuration option to indicate whether
compression is used within the RPL Instance and to specify the behavior
of nodes compliant with RFC 8138 when the bit is set and
unset.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

The design of Low-Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) is generally focused
on saving energy, which is the most constrained resource of all. The
routing optimizations in \"[RPL: IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and
Lossy Networks](#RFC6550){.xref}\" \[[RFC6550](#RFC6550){.xref}\], such
as routing along a Destination-Oriented Directed Acyclic Graph (DODAG)
to a Root Node and the associated routing header compression and
forwarding technique specified in \[[RFC8138](#RFC8138){.xref}\], derive
from that primary concern.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

Enabling \[[RFC8138](#RFC8138){.xref}\] on a running network requires a
\"flag day\", where the network is upgraded and rebooted. Otherwise, if
acting as a leaf, a node that does not support compression per
\[[RFC8138](#RFC8138){.xref}\] would fail to communicate; if acting as a
router, it would drop the compressed packets and black-hole a portion of
the network. This specification enables a hot upgrade where a live
network is migrated. During the migration, compression remains inactive
until all nodes are upgraded.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

This document complements \[[RFC8138](#RFC8138){.xref}\] and signals
whether it should be used within a RPL DODAG with a new flag in the RPL
DODAG Configuration option. The setting of this new flag is controlled
by the Root and propagates as is in the whole network as part of the
normal RPL signaling.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

The flag is cleared to ensure that compression remains inactive during
the migration phase. When the migration is complete (e.g., as known by
network management and/or inventory), the flag is set and compression is
globally activated in the whole DODAG.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

The terminology used in this document is consistent with, and
incorporates the terms provided in, \"[Terms Used in Routing for
Low-Power and Lossy Networks](#RFC7102){.xref}\"
\[[RFC7102](#RFC7102){.xref}\]. Other terms in use as related to LLNs
are found in \"[Terminology for Constrained-Node
Networks](#RFC7228){.xref}\"
\[[RFC7228](#RFC7228){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2.1-1){.pilcrow}

\"RPL\", \"RPL Packet Information\" (RPI), and \"RPL Instance\" (indexed
by a RPLInstanceID) are defined in \"[RPL: IPv6 Routing Protocol for
Low-Power and Lossy Networks](#RFC6550){.xref}\"
\[[RFC6550](#RFC6550){.xref}\]. The RPI is the abstract information that
RPL defines to be placed in data packets, e.g., as the RPL Option
\[[RFC6553](#RFC6553){.xref}\] within the IPv6 Hop-By-Hop Header. By
extension, the term \"RPI\" is often used to refer to the RPL Option
itself. The DODAG Information Solicitation (DIS), Destination
Advertisement Object (DAO), and DODAG Information Object (DIO) messages
are also specified in
\[[RFC6550](#RFC6550){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2.1-2){.pilcrow}

This document uses the terms \"RPL-Unaware Leaf\" (RUL) and \"RPL-Aware
Leaf\" (RAL) consistently with [\"Using RPI Option Type, Routing Header
for Source Routes, and IPv6-in-IPv6 Encapsulation in the RPL Data
Plane\"](#RFC9008){.xref} \[[RFC9008](#RFC9008){.xref}\]. The term
\"RPL-Aware Node\" (RAN) refers to a node that is either a RAL or a RPL
router. A RAN manages the reachability of its addresses and prefixes by
injecting them in RPL by itself. In contrast, a RUL leverages
\"[Registration Extensions for IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal
Area Network (6LoWPAN) Neighbor Discovery](#RFC8505){.xref}\"
\[[RFC8505](#RFC8505){.xref}\] to obtain reachability services from its
parent router(s) as specified in [\"Routing for RPL (Routing Protocol

:::

This specification defines a new flag, \"Enable Compression per RFC 8138
(T)\". The \'T\' flag is set to turn on the use of
\[[RFC8138](#RFC8138){.xref}\] within the DODAG. The \'T\' flag is
encoded in position 2 of the reserved flags in the DODAG Configuration
option (counting from bit 0 as the most significant bit) and set to 0 in
legacy implementations as specified in
Sections [20.14](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6550#section-20.14){.relref}
and
[6.7.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6550#section-6.7.6){.relref}
of \[[RFC6550](#RFC6550){.xref}\],
respectively.[¶](#section-3-3){.pilcrow}

[Section
4.1.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9008#section-4.1.2){.relref} of
\[[RFC9008](#RFC9008){.xref}\] updates \[[RFC6550](#RFC6550){.xref}\] to
indicate that the definition of the flags applies to Mode of Operation
(MOP) values zero (0) to six (6) only. For a MOP value of 7,
\[[RFC8138](#RFC8138){.xref}\] [MUST]{.bcp14} be used on links where
6LoWPAN Header Compression \[[RFC6282](#RFC6282){.xref}\] applies and
[MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be used otherwise.[¶](#section-3-4){.pilcrow}

The RPL DODAG Configuration option is typically placed in a DIO message.
The DIO message propagates down the DODAG to form and then maintain its
structure. The DODAG Configuration option is copied unmodified from
parents to children. \[[RFC6550](#RFC6550){.xref}\] states that \"Nodes
other than the DODAG root [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} modify this information
when propagating the DODAG Configuration option.\" Therefore, a legacy
parent propagates the \'T\' flag as set by the Root, and when the \'T\'
flag is set, it is transparently flooded to all the nodes in the
DODAG.[¶](#section-3-5){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-4 .section}
## [4.](#section-4){.section-number .selfRef} [Updating RFC 8138](#name-updating-rfc-8138){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-updating-rfc-8138}

A node [SHOULD]{.bcp14} generate packets in compressed form using
\[[RFC8138](#RFC8138){.xref}\] if and only if the \'T\' flag is set.
This behavior can be overridden by configuration or network management.
Overriding may be needed, e.g., to turn on compression in a network
where all nodes support \[[RFC8138](#RFC8138){.xref}\] but the Root does
not support this specification and cannot set the \'T\' flag, or to
disable it locally in case of a problem.[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

The decision to use \[[RFC8138](#RFC8138){.xref}\] is made by the
originator of the packet, depending on its capabilities and its
knowledge of the state of the \'T\' flag. A router encapsulating a
packet is the originator of the resulting packet and is responsible for
compressing the outer headers per \[[RFC8138](#RFC8138){.xref}\], but it
[MUST NOT]{.bcp14} perform compression on the encapsulated
packet.[¶](#section-4-2){.pilcrow}

An external target \[[RFC9008](#RFC9008){.xref}\] is not expected to
support \[[RFC8138](#RFC8138){.xref}\]. In most cases, packets to and
from an external target are tunneled back and forth between the border
router (referred to as a 6LoWPAN Router (6LR)) that serves the external
target and the Root, regardless of the MOP used in the RPL DODAG. The
inner packet is typically not compressed per
\[[RFC8138](#RFC8138){.xref}\], so for outgoing packets, the border
router just needs to decapsulate the (compressed) outer header and
forward the (uncompressed) inner packet towards the external
target.[¶](#section-4-3){.pilcrow}

A border router that forwards a packet to an external target
[MUST]{.bcp14} uncompress the packet first. In all other cases, a router
[MUST]{.bcp14} forward a packet in the form that the source used, either
compressed or uncompressed.[¶](#section-4-4){.pilcrow}

A RUL \[[RFC9010](#RFC9010){.xref}\] is both a leaf and an external
target. A RUL does not participate in RPL and depends on the parent
router to obtain connectivity. In the case of a RUL, forwarding towards
an external target actually means delivering the
packet.[¶](#section-4-5){.pilcrow}
:::

::: {#section-5 .section}
## [5.](#section-5){.section-number .selfRef} [Transition Scenarios](#name-transition-scenarios){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-transition-scenarios}

A node that supports \[[RFC8138](#RFC8138){.xref}\] but not this
specification can only be used in a homogeneous network. Enabling
compression per \[[RFC8138](#RFC8138){.xref}\] without a turn-on
signaling method requires a flag day, by which time all nodes must be
upgraded and at which point the network can be rebooted with 6LoRH
compression \[[RFC8138](#RFC8138){.xref}\] turned
on.[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

The intent of this specification is to perform a migration once and for
all, without the need for a flag day. In particular, the intent is not
to undo the setting of the \'T\' flag. Though it is possible to roll
back (see [Section 5.3](#rb){.xref}), the rollback operation
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} be complete before the network operator adds nodes that
do not support
\[[RFC8138](#RFC8138){.xref}\].[¶](#section-5-2){.pilcrow}

### [5.1.](#section-5.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Coexistence](#name-coexistence){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-coexistence}

A node that supports this specification can operate in a network with
6LoRH compression \[[RFC8138](#RFC8138){.xref}\] turned on or off with
the \'T\' flag set accordingly and in a network in transition from off
to on or on to off (see [Section
5.2](#mig){.xref}).[¶](#section-5.1-1){.pilcrow}

A node that does not support \[[RFC8138](#RFC8138){.xref}\] can
interoperate with nodes that do in a network with 6LoRH compression
\[[RFC8138](#RFC8138){.xref}\] turned off. If compression is turned on,
all the RANs are expected to be able to handle packets in compressed
form. A node that cannot do so may remain connected to the network as a
RUL as described in
\[[RFC9010](#RFC9010){.xref}\].[¶](#section-5.1-2){.pilcrow}

### [5.2.](#section-5.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Inconsistent State While Migrating](#name-inconsistent-state-while-mi){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-inconsistent-state-while-mi}

When the \'T\' flag is turned on by the Root, the information slowly
percolates through the DODAG as the DIO gets propagated. Some nodes will
see the flag and start sourcing packets in compressed form, while other
nodes in the same RPL DODAG will still not be aware of it. In
Non-Storing mode, the Root will start using
\[[RFC8138](#RFC8138){.xref}\] with a Source Routing Header 6LoRH
(SRH-6LoRH) that routes all the way to the parent router or to the
leaf.[¶](#section-5.2-1){.pilcrow}

To ensure that a packet is forwarded across the RPL DODAG in the form in
which it was generated, it is required that all the RPL nodes support
\[[RFC8138](#RFC8138){.xref}\] at the time of the
switch.[¶](#section-5.2-2){.pilcrow}

Setting the \'T\' flag is ultimately the responsibility of the network
administrator. The expectation is that the network management or
upgrading tools in place enable the network administrator to know when
all the nodes that may join a DODAG were migrated. In the case of a RPL
Instance with multiple Roots, all nodes that participate in the RPL
Instance may potentially join any DODAG. The network [MUST]{.bcp14} be
operated with the \'T\' flag unset until all nodes in the RPL Instance
are upgraded to support this specification.[¶](#section-5.2-3){.pilcrow}

When turning 6LoRH compression \[[RFC8138](#RFC8138){.xref}\] off in the
network, the network administrator [MUST]{.bcp14} wait until each node
has its \'T\' flag unset before allowing nodes that do not support
compression in the network. Information regarding whether compression is
active in a node [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be exposed in the node\'s management
interface.[¶](#section-5.3-1){.pilcrow}

Nodes that do not support \[[RFC8138](#RFC8138){.xref}\] [SHOULD
NOT]{.bcp14} be deployed in a network where compression is turned on. If
that is done, the node can only operate as a
RUL.[¶](#section-5.3-2){.pilcrow}

## [7.](#section-7){.section-number .selfRef} [Security Considerations](#name-security-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-security-considerations}

It is worth noting that in RPL \[[RFC6550](#RFC6550){.xref}\], every
node in the LLN that is RPL aware and has access to the RPL domain can
inject any RPL-based attack in the network; see
\[[RFC7416](#RFC7416){.xref}\] for details. This document typically
applies to an existing deployment and does not change its security
requirements and operations. It is assumed that the security mechanisms
as defined for RPL are followed.[¶](#section-7-1){.pilcrow}

Setting the \'T\' flag before all routers are upgraded may cause a loss
of packets. The new bit benefits from the same protection as the rest of
the information in the DODAG Configuration option that transports it.
Touching the new bit is just one of the many attacks that can happen if
an attacker manages to inject a corrupted configuration option in the
network.[¶](#section-7-2){.pilcrow}

Setting and unsetting the \'T\' flag may create inconsistencies in the
network, but as long as all nodes are upgraded to provide support for
\[[RFC8138](#RFC8138){.xref}\], they will be able to forward both forms.
The source is responsible for selecting whether the packet is compressed
or not, and all routers must use the format that the source selected.
So, the result of an inconsistency is merely that both forms will be
present in the network, at an additional cost of bandwidth for packets
in uncompressed form.[¶](#section-7-3){.pilcrow}

An attacker may unset the \'T\' flag to force additional energy
consumption of child or descendant nodes in its sub-DODAG. Conversely,
it may set the \'T\' flag so that nodes located downstream would
compress packets even when compression is not desired, potentially
causing packet loss. In a tree structure, the attacker would be in a
position to drop the packets from and to the attacked nodes. So, the
attacks mentioned above would be more complex and more visible than
simply dropping selected packets. The downstream node may have other
parents and see the bit with both settings; such a situation may be
detected, and an alert may be triggered.[¶](#section-7-4){.pilcrow}
