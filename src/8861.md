# RFC 8861 {#rfcnum}

# Sending Multiple RTP Streams in a Single RTP Session: Grouping RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Reception Statistics and Other Feedback {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

RTP allows multiple RTP streams to be sent in a single session but
requires each Synchronization Source (SSRC) to send RTP Control Protocol
(RTCP) reception quality reports for every other SSRC visible in the
session. This causes the number of RTCP reception reports to grow with
the number of SSRCs, rather than the number of endpoints. In many cases,
most of these RTCP reception reports are unnecessary, since all SSRCs of
an endpoint are normally co-located and see the same reception quality.
This memo defines a Reporting Group extension to RTCP to reduce the
reporting overhead in such scenarios.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) \[[RFC3550](#RFC3550){.xref}\] is
a protocol for group communication, supporting multiparty multimedia
sessions. A single RTP session can support multiple participants sending
data at once and can also support participants sending multiple
simultaneous RTP streams. Examples of the latter might include a
participant with multiple cameras who chooses to send multiple views of
a scene, or a participant that sends audio and video flows multiplexed
in a single RTP session. Rules for handling RTP sessions containing
multiple RTP streams are described in \[[RFC3550](#RFC3550){.xref}\],
with some clarifications in
\[[RFC8108](#RFC8108){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

An RTP endpoint will have one or more Synchronization Sources (SSRCs).
It will have at least one RTP stream, and thus at least one SSRC, for
each media source it sends, and it might use multiple SSRCs per media
source when using [media scalability features](#RFC6190){.xref}
\[[RFC6190](#RFC6190){.xref}\], forward error correction, [RTP
retransmission](#RFC4588){.xref} \[[RFC4588](#RFC4588){.xref}\], or
similar mechanisms. An endpoint that is not sending any RTP streams will
have at least one SSRC to use for reporting and any feedback messages.
Each SSRC has to send RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Sender Reports (SRs)
corresponding to the RTP packets it sends and Receiver Reports (RRs) for
traffic it receives. (SRs and RRs are described in
\[[RFC3550](#RFC3550){.xref}\].) That is, every SSRC will send RTCP
packets to report on every other SSRC. This rule is simple, but it can
be quite inefficient for endpoints that send large numbers of RTP
streams in a single RTP session. Consider a session comprising ten
participants, each sending three media sources, each media source
associated with its own RTP stream. There will be 30 SSRCs in such an
RTP session, and each of those 30 SSRCs will send an RTCP SR/RR packet
(containing several report blocks) per reporting interval as each SSRC
reports on all the others. However, the three SSRCs comprising each
participant are commonly co-located such that they see identical
reception quality. If there was a way to indicate that several SSRCs are
co-located and see the same reception quality, then two-thirds of those
RTCP reports could be suppressed. This would allow the remaining RTCP
reports to be sent more often, while keeping within the same RTCP
bandwidth fraction.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

This memo defines such an RTCP extension: RTCP Reporting Groups. This
extension is used to indicate the SSRCs that originate from the same
endpoint and therefore have identical reception quality, hence allowing
the endpoints to suppress unnecessary RTCP reception quality
reports.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

An RTCP Reporting Group is a set of SSRCs that are co‑located at a
single endpoint (which could be an end host or a middlebox) in an RTP
session. Since they are co-located, every SSRC in the RTCP Reporting
Group will have an identical view of the network conditions and will see
the same lost packets, jitter, etc. This allows a single representative
to send RTCP reception quality reports on behalf of the rest of the
Reporting Group, reducing the number of RTCP packets that need to be
sent without loss of information.[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-3.1 .section}
### [3.1.](#section-3.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Semantics and Behavior of RTCP Reporting Groups](#name-semantics-and-behavior-of-r){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-semantics-and-behavior-of-r}

A group of co-located SSRCs that see identical network conditions can
form an RTCP Reporting Group. If Reporting Groups are in use, an RTP
endpoint with multiple SSRCs [MAY]{.bcp14} put those SSRCs into a
Reporting Group if their view of the network is identical, i.e., if they
report on traffic received at the same interface of an RTP endpoint.
SSRCs with different views of the network [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be put into
the same Reporting Group.[¶](#section-3.1-1){.pilcrow}

An endpoint that has combined its SSRCs into an RTCP Reporting Group
will choose one (or a subset) of those SSRCs to act as \"reporting
source(s)\" for that RTCP Reporting Group. A reporting source will send
RTCP SR/RR reception quality reports on behalf of the other members of
the RTCP Reporting Group. A reporting source [MUST]{.bcp14} suppress the
RTCP SR/RR reports that relate to other members of the Reporting Group
and only report on remote SSRCs. The other members (non-reporting
sources) of the RTCP Reporting Group will suppress their RTCP reception
quality reports and will instead send an RTCP Reporting Group Reporting
Sources (RGRS) packet (see [Section 3.2.2](#sec-rgrs){.xref}) to
indicate that they are part of an RTCP Reporting Group and give the
SSRCs of the reporting sources.[¶](#section-3.1-2){.pilcrow}

If there are large numbers of remote SSRCs in the RTP session, then the
reception quality reports generated by the reporting source might grow
too large to fit into a single compound RTCP packet, forcing the
reporting source to use a round-robin policy to determine what remote
SSRCs it includes in each compound RTCP packet, and so reducing the
frequency of reports on each SSRC. To avoid this, in sessions with large
numbers of remote SSRCs, an RTCP Reporting Group [MAY]{.bcp14} use more
than one reporting source. If several SSRCs are acting as reporting
sources for an RTCP Reporting Group, then each reporting source
[MUST]{.bcp14} have non-overlapping sets of remote SSRCs it reports
on.[¶](#section-3.1-3){.pilcrow}

An endpoint [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} create an RTCP Reporting Group that
comprises only a single local SSRC (i.e., an RTCP Reporting Group where
the reporting source is the only member of the group), unless it is
anticipated that the group might have additional SSRCs added to it in
the future.[¶](#section-3.1-4){.pilcrow}

If a reporting source leaves the RTP session (i.e., if it sends an RTCP
BYE packet or it leaves the session without sending a BYE according to
the rules of \[[RFC3550](#RFC3550){.xref}\], [Section
6.3.7](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3550#section-6.3.7){.relref}),
the remaining members of the RTCP Reporting Group [MUST]{.bcp14}
(a) have another reporting source \-- if one exists \-- report on the
remote SSRCs that the leaving SSRC had reported on, (b) choose a new
reporting source, or (c) disband the RTCP Reporting Group and begin
sending reception quality reports per \[[RFC3550](#RFC3550){.xref}\] and
\[[RFC8108](#RFC8108){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3.1-5){.pilcrow}

The RTCP timing rules assign different bandwidth fractions to senders
and receivers. This lets senders transmit RTCP reception quality reports
more often than receivers. If a reporting source in an RTCP Reporting
Group is a receiver but one or more non-reporting SSRCs in the RTCP
Reporting Group are senders, then the endpoint [MAY]{.bcp14} treat the
reporting source as a sender for the purpose of RTCP bandwidth
allocation, increasing its RTCP bandwidth allocation, provided it also
treats one of the senders as if it were a receiver and makes the
corresponding reduction in RTCP bandwidth for that SSRC. However, the
application needs to consider the impact on the frequency of
transmitting of the synchronization information included in RTCP
SRs.[¶](#section-3.1-6){.pilcrow}

When RTCP Reporting Groups are in use, the other SSRCs in the RTP
session need to be able to identify which SSRCs are members of an RTCP
Reporting Group. Two RTCP extensions are defined to support this: the
RTCP Reporting Group (RGRP) Source Description (SDES) item is used by
the reporting source(s) to identify an RTCP Reporting Group, and the
RTCP RGRS packet is used by other members of an RTCP Reporting Group to
identify the reporting source(s).[¶](#section-3.2-1){.pilcrow}

This document defines a new RTCP RGRP SDES item to identify an RTCP
Reporting Group. The motivation for giving a Reporting Group an
identifier is to ensure that (1) the RTCP Reporting Group and its member
SSRCs can be correctly associated when there are multiple reporting
sources and (2) a reporting SSRC can be associated with the correct
Reporting Group if an SSRC collision
occurs.[¶](#section-3.2.1-1){.pilcrow}

This document defines the RTCP RGRP SDES item. The RTCP RGRP SDES item
[MUST]{.bcp14} be sent by the reporting sources in a Reporting Group and
[MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be sent by other members of the Reporting Group or by
SSRCs that are not members of any RTCP Reporting Group. Specifically,
every reporting source in an RTCP Reporting Group [MUST]{.bcp14} include
an RTCP SDES packet containing an RGRP item in every compound RTCP
packet in which it sends an RR or SR packet (i.e., in every RTCP packet
it sends, unless [Reduced-Size RTCP](#RFC5506){.xref}
\[[RFC5506](#RFC5506){.xref}\] is in
use).[¶](#section-3.2.1-2){.pilcrow}

Syntactically, the format of the RTCP RGRP SDES item is identical to
that of the [RTCP SDES CNAME item](#RFC7022){.xref}
\[[RFC7022](#RFC7022){.xref}\], except that the SDES item type field
[MUST]{.bcp14} have value RGRP=11 instead of CNAME=1. The value of the
RTCP RGRP SDES item [MUST]{.bcp14} be chosen with the same concerns
about global uniqueness and the same privacy considerations as the RTCP
SDES CNAME. The value of the RTCP RGRP SDES item [MUST]{.bcp14} be
stable throughout the lifetime of the Reporting Group, even if some or
all of the reporting sources change their SSRC due to collisions or if
the set of reporting sources changes.[¶](#section-3.2.1-3){.pilcrow}

An RTP mixer or translator that forwards RTCP SR or RR packets from
members of a Reporting Group [MUST]{.bcp14} forward the corresponding
RTCP RGRP SDES items as well, even if it otherwise strips SDES items
other than the CNAME item.[¶](#section-3.2.1-4){.pilcrow}

A new RTCP packet type is defined to allow the members of an RTCP
Reporting Group to identify the reporting sources for that group. This
allows participants in an RTP session to distinguish an SSRC that is
sending empty RTCP reception reports because it is a member of an RTCP
Reporting Group from an SSRC that is sending empty RTCP reception
reports because it is not receiving any traffic. It also explicitly
identifies the reporting sources, allowing other members of the RTP
session to (1) know which SSRCs are acting as the reporting sources for
an RTCP Reporting Group and (2) detect if RTCP packets from any of the
reporting sources are being lost.[¶](#section-3.2.2-1){.pilcrow}

The format of the RTCP RGRS packet is defined below. It comprises the
fixed RTCP header that indicates the packet type and length, the SSRC of
the packet sender, and a list of reporting sources for the RTCP
Reporting Group of which the packet sender is a
member.[¶](#section-3.2.2-2){.pilcrow}

The use of the RTP/AVPF Feedback Profile \[[RFC4585](#RFC4585){.xref}\]
allows SSRCs to send rapid RTCP feedback requests and codec control
messages. If the use of the RTP/AVPF profile has been negotiated in an
RTP session, members of an RTCP Reporting Group can send rapid RTCP
feedback and codec control messages per \[[RFC5104](#RFC5104){.xref}\],
per \[[RFC4585](#RFC4585){.xref}\] as updated by [Section
5.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8108#section-5.4){.relref} of
\[[RFC8108](#RFC8108){.xref}\], and by the following
considerations.[¶](#section-3.3-1){.pilcrow}

The members of an RTCP Reporting Group will all see identical network
conditions. Accordingly, one might therefore think that it doesn\'t
matter which SSRC in the Reporting Group sends the RTP/AVPF feedback or
codec control messages. There might be, however, cases where the sender
of the feedback/codec control message has semantic importance, or when
only a subset of the members of an RTCP Reporting Group might want to
send RTP/AVPF feedback or a codec control message in response to a
particular event. For example, an RTP video sender might choose to treat
packet loss feedback received from SSRCs known to be audio receivers
with less urgency than feedback that it receives from video receivers
when deciding what packets to retransmit, and a multimedia receiver
using Reporting Groups might want to choose the outgoing SSRC for
feedback packets to reflect this.[¶](#section-3.3-2){.pilcrow}

Each member of an RTCP Reporting Group [SHOULD]{.bcp14} therefore send
RTP/AVPF feedback/codec control messages independently of the other
members of the Reporting Group, to respect the semantic meaning of the
message sender. The suppression rules of \[[RFC4585](#RFC4585){.xref}\]
will ensure that only a single copy of each feedback packet is
(typically) generated, even if several members of a Reporting Group send
the same feedback. When an endpoint knows that several members of its
RTCP Reporting Group will be sending identical feedback and that the
sender of the feedback is not semantically important, that endpoint
[MAY]{.bcp14} choose to send all its feedback from the reporting source
and deterministically suppress feedback packets generated by the other
sources in the Reporting Group.[¶](#section-3.3-3){.pilcrow}

It is important to note that the RTP/AVPF timing rules operate on a
per-SSRC basis. Using a single reporting source to send all feedback for
a Reporting Group will hence limit the amount of feedback that can be
sent to that which can be sent by one SSRC. If this limit is a problem,
then the Reporting Group can allow each of its members to send its own
feedback, using its own SSRC.[¶](#section-3.3-4){.pilcrow}

If the RTP/AVPF feedback messages or codec control requests are sent as
compound RTCP packets, then those compound RTCP packets [MUST]{.bcp14}
include either an RTCP RGRS packet or an RTCP RGRP SDES item, depending
on whether they are sent by the reporting source or a non‑reporting
source in the RTCP Reporting Group, respectively. The contents of
noncompound RTCP feedback or codec control messages are not affected by
the use of RTCP Reporting Groups.[¶](#section-3.3-5){.pilcrow}

When using RTCP Extended Report (XR) packets
\[[RFC3611](#RFC3611){.xref}\] with RTCP Reporting Groups, it is
[RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14} that the reporting source be used to send the RTCP
XR packets. If multiple reporting sources are in use, the reporting
source that sends the SR/RR packets that relate to a particular remote
SSRC [SHOULD]{.bcp14} send the RTCP XR reports about that SSRC. This is
motivated as one commonly combine the RTCP XR metrics with the regular
report block to more fully understand the situation. Receiving these
blocks in different compound packets reduces their value, as the
measuring intervals are not synchronized in those
cases.[¶](#section-3.4-1){.pilcrow}

Some RTCP XR report blocks are specific to particular types of media and
might be relevant to only some members of a Reporting Group. For
example, it would make no sense for an SSRC that is receiving video to
send a Voice over IP (VoIP) metric RTCP XR report block. Such
media-specific RTCP XR report blocks [MUST]{.bcp14} be sent by the SSRC
to which they are relevant and [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be included in the
common report sent by the reporting source. This might mean that some
SSRCs send RTCP XR packets in compound RTCP packets that contain an
empty RTCP SR/RR packet and that the time period covered by the RTCP XR
packet is different from that covered by the RTCP SR/RR packet. If it is
important that the RTCP XR packet and RTCP SR/RR packet cover the same
time period, then that source [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be removed from the RTCP
Reporting Group, and standard RTCP packets be sent
instead.[¶](#section-3.4-2){.pilcrow}

### [3.5.](#section-3.5){.section-number .selfRef} [Middlebox Considerations](#name-middlebox-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-middlebox-considerations}

Many different types of middleboxes are used with RTP. RTCP Reporting
Groups are potentially relevant to those types of RTP middleboxes that
have their own SSRCs and generate RTCP reports for the traffic they
receive. RTP middleboxes that do not have their own SSRC and that do not
send RTCP reports on the traffic they receive cannot use the RTCP
Reporting Group extension, since they generate no RTCP reports to that
group.[¶](#section-3.5-1){.pilcrow}

An RTP middlebox that has several SSRCs of its own can use the RTCP
Reporting Group extension to group the RTCP reports it generates. This
can occur, for example, if a middlebox is acting as an RTP mixer for
both audio and video flows that are multiplexed onto a single RTP
session, where the middlebox has one SSRC for the audio mixer and one
for the video mixer part, and when the middlebox wants to avoid
cross-reporting between audio and video.[¶](#section-3.5-2){.pilcrow}

A middlebox cannot use the RTCP Reporting Group extension to group RTCP
packets from the SSRCs that it is forwarding. It can, however, group the
RTCP packets from the SSRCs it is forwarding into compound RTCP packets,
following the rules in [Section
6.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3550#section-6.1){.relref} of
\[[RFC3550](#RFC3550){.xref}\] and [Section
5.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8108#section-5.3){.relref} of
\[[RFC8108](#RFC8108){.xref}\]. If the middlebox is using RTCP Reporting
Groups for its own SSRCs, it [MAY]{.bcp14} include RTCP packets from the
SSRCs that it is forwarding as part of the compound RTCP packets its
reporting source generates.[¶](#section-3.5-3){.pilcrow}

A middlebox that forwards RTCP SR or RR packets sent by members of a
Reporting Group [MUST]{.bcp14} forward the corresponding RTCP RGRP SDES
items, as described in [Section 3.2.1](#sec-rgrp){.xref}. A middlebox
that forwards RTCP SR or RR packets sent by members of a Reporting Group
[MUST]{.bcp14} also forward the corresponding RTCP RGRS packets, as
described in [Section 3.2.2](#sec-rgrs){.xref}. Failure to forward these
packets can cause compatibility problems, as described in [Section
4.2](#compat){.xref}.[¶](#section-3.5-4){.pilcrow}

If a middlebox rewrites SSRC values in the RTP and RTCP packets that it
is forwarding, then it [MUST]{.bcp14} make the corresponding changes in
RTCP SDES packets containing RGRP items and in RTCP RGRS packets, to
allow them to be associated with the rewritten
SSRCs.[¶](#section-3.5-5){.pilcrow}

### [4.1.](#section-4.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Bandwidth Benefits of RTCP Reporting Groups](#name-bandwidth-benefits-of-rtcp-){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-bandwidth-benefits-of-rtcp-}

To understand the benefits of RTCP Reporting Groups, consider a scenario
in which the two endpoints in a session each have a hundred sources, of
which eight each are sending within any given reporting
interval.[¶](#section-4.1-1){.pilcrow}

For ease of analysis, we can make the simplifying approximation that the
duration of the RTCP reporting interval is equal to the total size of
the RTCP packets sent during an RTCP interval, divided by the RTCP
bandwidth. (This will be approximately true in scenarios where the
bandwidth is not so high that the minimum RTCP interval is reached.) To
further simplify, we can assume that RTCP senders are following the
recommendations regarding compound RTCP packets in
\[[RFC8108](#RFC8108){.xref}\]; thus, the per-packet transport-layer
overhead will be small relative to the RTCP data. Thus, only the actual
RTCP data itself need be considered.[¶](#section-4.1-2){.pilcrow}

In a report interval in this scenario, there will, as a baseline, be 200
SDES packets, 184 RR packets, and 16 SR packets. This amounts to
approximately 6.5 KB of RTCP packets per report interval, assuming
16-byte CNAMEs and no other SDES
information.[¶](#section-4.1-3){.pilcrow}

Using the original \"everyone reports on every sender\" feedback rules
\[[RFC3550](#RFC3550){.xref}\], each of the 184 receivers will send 16
report blocks, and each of the 16 senders will send 15. This amounts to
approximately 76 KB of report block traffic per interval; 92% of RTCP
traffic consists of report blocks.[¶](#section-4.1-4){.pilcrow}

If Reporting Groups are used, however, there is only 0.4 KB of reports
per interval, with no loss of useful information. Additionally, there
will be (assuming 16-byte RGRPs and a single reporting source per
Reporting Group) an additional 2.4 KB per cycle of RTCP RGRP SDES items
and RGRS packets. Put another way, the unmodified reporting interval per
\[[RFC3550](#RFC3550){.xref}\] is approximately 9 times longer than if
Reporting Groups are in use.[¶](#section-4.1-5){.pilcrow}

### [4.2.](#section-4.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Compatibility of RTCP Reporting Groups](#name-compatibility-of-rtcp-repor){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-compatibility-of-rtcp-repor}

The RTCP traffic generated by receivers using RTCP Reporting Groups
might appear, to observers unaware of these semantics, to be generated
by receivers who are experiencing a network disconnection, as the
non-reporting sources appear not to be receiving a given sender at
all.[¶](#section-4.2-1){.pilcrow}

This could be a potentially critical problem for such a sender using
RTCP for congestion control, as such a sender might think that it is
sending so much traffic that it is causing complete congestion
collapse.[¶](#section-4.2-2){.pilcrow}

However, such an interpretation of the session statistics would require
a fairly sophisticated RTCP analysis. Any receiver of RTCP statistics
that is just interested in information about itself needs to be prepared
for the possibility that any given reception report might not contain
information about a specific media source, because reception reports in
large conferences can be round-robined.[¶](#section-4.2-3){.pilcrow}

Thus, the extent to which such backward-compatibility issues would
actually cause trouble in practice is
unclear.[¶](#section-4.2-4){.pilcrow}

## [5.](#section-5){.section-number .selfRef} [Security Considerations](#name-security-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-security-considerations}

The security considerations of \[[RFC3550](#RFC3550){.xref}\] and
\[[RFC8108](#RFC8108){.xref}\] apply. If the RTP/AVPF profile is in use,
then the security considerations of \[[RFC4585](#RFC4585){.xref}\] (and
\[[RFC5104](#RFC5104){.xref}\], if used) also apply. If RTCP XR is used,
the security considerations of \[[RFC3611](#RFC3611){.xref}\], including
security considerations regarding any XR report blocks used, also
apply.[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

The RTCP RGRP SDES item is vulnerable to malicious modifications unless
integrity protection is used. A modification of this item\'s length
field causes the parsing of the RTCP packet in which it is contained to
fail. Depending on the implementation, parsing of the full compound RTCP
packet can also fail, causing the whole packet to be discarded. A
modification of the value of this SDES item would make the receiver of
the report think that the sender of the report was a member of a
different RTCP Reporting Group. This will potentially create an
inconsistency, when the RGRS reports the source as being in the same
Reporting Group as another source with another Reporting Group
identifier. The impacts on a receiver implementation that such
inconsistencies could cause are difficult to fully predict. One case is
that when congestion control or other adaptation mechanisms are used, an
inconsistent report can result in a media sender reducing its bitrate.
However, a direct modification of the RR or a feedback message itself
would be a more efficient attack and would be equally costly to
perform.[¶](#section-5-2){.pilcrow}

The new RGRS RTCP packet type is very simple. The common RTCP packet
type header shares the same security risks as those that affect previous
RTCP packet types. Errors or modification of the length field can cause
the full compound packet to fail header validation (see [Appendix
A.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3550#appendix-A.2){.relref} of
\[[RFC3550](#RFC3550){.xref}\]), resulting in the whole compound RTCP
packet being discarded. Modification of the SC field or the P field
would cause an inconsistency when processing the RTCP packet, likely
resulting in the packet being classified as invalid. A modification of
the PT field would cause the packet to be interpreted according to some
other packet type\'s rules. In such a case, the result might be more or
less predictable but would be specific to the packet type. Modification
of the \"SSRC of packet sender\" field would attribute this packet to
another sender, resulting in a receiver believing that the Reporting
Group also applies for this SSRC, if it exists. If it doesn\'t exist,
unless corresponding modifications are also done on an SR/RR packet and
an SDES packet, the RTCP packet [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be discarded. If
consistent changes are done, such a scenario could be part of a resource
exhaustion attack on a receiver implementation. Modification of the
\"List of SSRCs for the Reporting Source(s)\" field would change the
SSRC the receiver expects to report on behalf of this SSRC. If that SSRC
exists, this situation could potentially change the Reporting Group used
for this SSRC. A change to another Reporting Group belonging to another
endpoint is likely detectable, as there would be a mismatch between the
SSRC of the packet sender\'s endpoint information, transport addresses,
SDES CNAME, etc., and the corresponding information from the Reporting
Group indicated.[¶](#section-5-3){.pilcrow}

In general, the Reporting Group is providing limited-impact attacks on
the endpoints. The most significant result from a deliberate attack
would be to cause the information to be discarded or be inconsistent,
including the discarding of all RTCP packets that are modified. This
causes a lack of information at any receiver entity, possibly
disregarding the endpoint\'s participation in the
session.[¶](#section-5-4){.pilcrow}

To protect against such attacks from external non-trusted entities,
integrity and source authentication [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be applied. This
can be done, for example, by using [the Secure Real-time Transport
Protocol (SRTP)](#RFC3711){.xref} \[[RFC3711](#RFC3711){.xref}\] with
appropriate key management; other options exist, as discussed in
[\"Options for Securing RTP Sessions\"](#RFC7201){.xref}
\[[RFC7201](#RFC7201){.xref}\].[¶](#section-5-5){.pilcrow}

The Reporting Group Identifier has properties that could potentially
impact privacy. If this identifier were to be generated by an
implementation in a way that makes it long-term stable or predictable,
it could be used for tracking a particular endpoint. Therefore, it is
[RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14} that it be generated as a short-term persistent
RGRP, following the rules for short-term persistent CNAMEs in
\[[RFC7022](#RFC7022){.xref}\]. The rest of the information revealed,
i.e., the SSRCs, the size of the Reporting Group, and the number of
reporting sources in a Reporting Group, is of a less sensitive nature,
considering that the SSRCs and the communication would be revealed
without this extension anyway. By encrypting the Reporting Group
extensions, the confidentiality of the SSRC values would be preserved,
but the values can still be revealed if [SRTP](#RFC3711){.xref}
\[[RFC3711](#RFC3711){.xref}\] is used. The size of the Reporting Groups
and the number of reporting sources are likely determinable from
analysis of the packet pattern and sizes. However, this information
appears to have limited value.[¶](#section-5-6){.pilcrow}
