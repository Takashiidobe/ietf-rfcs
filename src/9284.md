In many deployments, it may not be possible for a network to determine
the cause of a DDoS attack \[[RFC4732](#RFC4732){.xref}\]. Rather, the
network may just realize that some resources appear to be under attack.
To help with such situations, the IETF has specified the DDoS Open
Threat Signaling (DOTS) architecture \[[RFC8811](#RFC8811){.xref}\],
where a DOTS client can inform an upstream DOTS server that its network
is under a potential attack and that appropriate mitigation actions are
required. The DOTS protocols can be used to coordinate real-time
mitigation efforts that can evolve as the attacks mutate, thereby
reducing the impact of an attack and leading to more-efficient
responsive actions. \[[RFC8903](#RFC8903){.xref}\] identifies a set of
scenarios for DOTS; most of these scenarios involve a Customer Premises
Equipment (CPE).[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

The high-level base DOTS architecture is illustrated in [Figure
1](#arch){.xref} (repeated from [Section
2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8811#section-2){.relref} of
\[[RFC8811](#RFC8811){.xref}\]):[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC8811](#RFC8811){.xref}\] specifies that the DOTS client may be
provided with a list of DOTS servers; each of these servers is
associated with one or more IP addresses. These addresses may or may not
be of the same address family. The DOTS client establishes one or more
DOTS sessions by connecting to the provided addresses for the DOTS
server or servers
\[[RFC8973](#RFC8973){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

DOTS may be deployed within networks that are connected to one single
upstream provider. DOTS can also be enabled within networks that are
multihomed. The reader may refer to \[[RFC3582](#RFC3582){.xref}\] for
an overview of multihoming goals and motivations. This document
discusses DOTS multihoming considerations. Specifically, the document
aims to:[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}

1.  ::: {#section-1-6.1}
    Complete the base DOTS architecture with multihoming specifics.
    Those specifics need to be taken into account
    because:[¶](#section-1-6.1.1){.pilcrow}

    -   [Sending a DOTS mitigation request to an arbitrary DOTS server
        will not necessarily help in mitigating a DDoS
        attack.[¶](#section-1-6.1.2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-6.1.2.1}
    -   [Randomly replicating all DOTS mitigation requests among all
        available DOTS servers is
        suboptimal.[¶](#section-1-6.1.2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-6.1.2.2}
    -   [Sequentially contacting DOTS servers may increase the delay
        before a mitigation plan is
        enforced.[¶](#section-1-6.1.2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-6.1.2.3}
    :::

2.  [Identify DOTS deployment schemes in a multihoming context, where
    DOTS services can be offered by all or a subset of upstream
    providers.[¶](#section-1-6.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-6.2}

3.  ::: {#section-1-6.3}
    Provide guidelines and recommendations for placing DOTS requests in
    multihomed networks, for example:[¶](#section-1-6.3.1){.pilcrow}

    -   [Select the appropriate DOTS
        server(s).[¶](#section-1-6.3.2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-6.3.2.1}

in \[[RFC9132](#RFC9132){.xref}\] and \[[RFC8783](#RFC8783){.xref}\].

Provider-Aggregatable (PA) addresses:
:   globally unique addresses assigned by a transit provider to a
    customer. The addresses are considered \"aggregatable\" because the
    set of routes corresponding to the PA addresses are usually covered
    by an aggregate route set corresponding to the address space
    operated by the transit provider, from which the assignment was made
    ([Section

This section describes some multihoming scenarios that are relevant to
DOTS. In the following subsections, only the connections of border
routers are shown; internal network topologies are not
elaborated.[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

A multihomed network may enable DOTS for all or a subset of its upstream
interconnection links. In such a case, DOTS servers can be explicitly
configured or dynamically discovered by a DOTS client using means such
as those discussed in \[[RFC8973](#RFC8973){.xref}\]. These DOTS servers
can be owned by the upstream provider, managed by a third-party (e.g.,
mitigation service provider), or a combination
thereof.[¶](#section-4-2){.pilcrow}

If a DOTS server is explicitly configured, it is assumed that an
interface is also provided to bind the DOTS service to an
interconnection link. If no interface is provided, the DOTS server can
be reached via any active interface.[¶](#section-4-3){.pilcrow}

This section distinguishes between residential CPEs and enterprise CPEs
because PI addresses may be used for enterprises, which is not the
current practice for residential CPEs.[¶](#section-4-4){.pilcrow}

are associated with DOTS servers.[¶](#section-4-5){.pilcrow}

follows:[¶](#section-4.1-1){.pilcrow}

    CPE.[¶](#section-4.1-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.1-2.1}

    in \[[RFC7556](#RFC7556){.xref}\].[¶](#section-4.1-2.2.1){.pilcrow}

    In a typical deployment scenario, these provisioning domains are
    owned by the same provider ([Section
    1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8803#section-1){.relref} of
    \[[RFC8803](#RFC8803){.xref}\]). Such a deployment is meant to
    seamlessly use both fixed and cellular networks for bonding, faster
    handovers, or better resiliency
    purposes.[¶](#section-4.1-2.2.2){.pilcrow}
    :::

-   [Each of these provisioning domains assigns IP addresses or prefixes
    to the CPE and provides additional configuration information such as
    a list of DNS servers, DNS suffixes associated with the network, the
    default gateway address, and the DOTS server\'s name

:::

The DOTS client [MUST]{.bcp14} resolve the DOTS server\'s name provided
by each provisioning domain using the DNS servers either learned from
the respective provisioning domain or associated with the interface(s)
for which a DOTS server was explicitly configured ([Section
4](#msc){.xref}). IPv6-capable DOTS clients [MUST]{.bcp14} use the
source address selection algorithm defined in
\[[RFC6724](#RFC6724){.xref}\] to select the candidate source addresses
to contact each of these DOTS servers. DOTS sessions [MUST]{.bcp14} be
established and [MUST]{.bcp14} be maintained with each of the DOTS
servers because the mitigation scope of each of these servers is
restricted. The DOTS client [MUST]{.bcp14} use the security credentials
(a certificate, typically) provided by a provisioning domain to
authenticate itself to the DOTS server(s) provided by the same
provisioning domain. How such security credentials are provided to the
DOTS client is out of the scope of this document. The reader may refer
to [Section
7.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9132#section-7.1){.relref} of
\[[RFC9132](#RFC9132){.xref}\] for more details about DOTS
authentication methods.[¶](#section-5.1-3){.pilcrow}

When conveying a mitigation request to protect the attack target(s), the
DOTS client [MUST]{.bcp14} select an available DOTS server whose network
has assigned the IP prefixes from which target addresses or prefixes are
derived. This implies that if no appropriate DOTS server is found, the
DOTS client [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} send the mitigation request to any other
available DOTS server.[¶](#section-5.1-4){.pilcrow}

For example, a mitigation request to protect target resources bound to a
PA IP address or prefix cannot be satisfied by a provisioning domain
other than the one that owns those addresses or prefixes. Consequently,
if a CPE detects a DDoS attack that spreads over all its network
attachments, it [MUST]{.bcp14} contact all DOTS servers for mitigation
purposes.[¶](#section-5.1-5){.pilcrow}

The DOTS client [MUST]{.bcp14} be able to associate a DOTS server with
each provisioning domain it serves. For example, if the DOTS client is
provisioned with S1 using DHCP when attaching to a first network and
with S2 using Protocol Configuration Option (PCO)
\[[TS.24008](#TS.24008){.xref}\] when attaching to a second network, the
DOTS client must record the interface from which a DOTS server was
provisioned. A DOTS signaling session to a given DOTS server must be
established using the interface from which the DOTS server was
provisioned. If a DOTS server is explicitly configured, DOTS signaling
with that server must be established via the interfaces that are
indicated in the explicit configuration or via any active interface if
no interface is configured.[¶](#section-5.1-6){.pilcrow}

When PA addresses or prefixes are in use, the same considerations
discussed in [Section 5.1](#dcpe){.xref} need to be followed by the
client-domain DOTS gateway to contact its DOTS server(s). The
client-domain DOTS gateways can be reachable from DOTS clients by using
a unicast address or an anycast address ([Section
3.2.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8811#section-3.2.4){.relref} of
\[[RFC8811](#RFC8811){.xref}\]).[¶](#section-5.2-4){.pilcrow}

Nevertheless, when PI addresses or prefixes are assigned, and absent any
policy, the client-domain DOTS gateway [SHOULD]{.bcp14} send mitigation
requests to all its DOTS servers. Otherwise, the attack traffic may
still be delivered via the ISP that hasn\'t received the mitigation
request.[¶](#section-5.2-5){.pilcrow}

An alternate deployment model is depicted in [Figure 7](#mcms){.xref}.
This deployment assumes that:[¶](#section-5.2-6){.pilcrow}

-   [One or more DOTS clients are enabled in hosts located in the
    internal network. These DOTS clients may use

If PI addresses or prefixes are in use, the DOTS client [MUST]{.bcp14}
send a mitigation request to all the DOTS servers. The use of the same
anycast addresses to reach these DOTS servers is [NOT
RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14}. If a well-known anycast address is used to reach
multiple DOTS servers, the CPE may not be able to select the appropriate
provisioning domain to which the mitigation request should be forwarded.
As a consequence, the request may not be forwarded to the appropriate
DOTS server.[¶](#section-5.2-9){.pilcrow}

If PA addresses or prefixes are used, the same considerations discussed
in [Section 5.1](#dcpe){.xref} need to be followed by the DOTS clients.
Because DOTS clients are not embedded in the CPE and multiple addresses
or prefixes may not be assigned to the DOTS client (typically in an IPv4
context), some issues may arise in how to steer traffic towards the
appropriate DOTS server by using the appropriate source IP address.
These complications discussed in \[[RFC4116](#RFC4116){.xref}\] are not
specific to DOTS.[¶](#section-5.2-10){.pilcrow}

Another deployment approach is to enable many DOTS clients; each of them
is responsible for handling communications with a specific DOTS server
(see [Figure 8](#scms){.xref}).[¶](#section-5.2-11){.pilcrow}

For both deployments depicted in Figures [7](#mcms){.xref} and

policies (e.g., a prefix filter that is used to filter DDoS detection
alarms) that will trigger DOTS communications with the DOTS servers.
Such policies will help the DOTS client to select the appropriate
destination DOTS server. The CPE [MUST]{.bcp14} select the appropriate
source IP address when forwarding DOTS messages received from an
internal DOTS client.[¶](#section-5.2-13){.pilcrow}
