# Temporary Address Extensions for Stateless Address Autoconfiguration in IPv6 {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

This document describes an extension to IPv6 Stateless Address
Autoconfiguration that causes hosts to generate temporary addresses with
randomized interface identifiers for each prefix advertised with
autoconfiguration enabled. Changing addresses over time limits the
window of time during which eavesdroppers and other information
collectors may trivially perform address-based network-activity
correlation when the same address is employed for multiple transactions
by the same host. Additionally, it reduces the window of exposure of a
host as being accessible via an address that becomes revealed as a
result of active communication. This document obsoletes RFC
4941.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC4862](#RFC4862){.xref}\] specifies Stateless Address
Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) for IPv6, which typically results in hosts
configuring one or more \"stable\" IPv6 addresses composed of a network
prefix advertised by a local router and a locally generated interface
identifier (IID). The security and privacy implications of such
addresses have been discussed in detail in
\[[RFC7721](#RFC7721){.xref}\], \[[RFC7217](#RFC7217){.xref}\], and
\[[RFC7707](#RFC7707){.xref}\]. This document specifies an extension to
SLAAC for generating temporary addresses that can help mitigate some of
the aforementioned issues. This document is a revision of RFC 4941 and
formally obsoletes it. [Section 5](#changes){.xref} describes the
changes from \[[RFC4941](#RFC4941){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

The default address selection for IPv6 has been specified in
\[[RFC6724](#RFC6724){.xref}\]. In some cases, the determination as to
whether to use stable versus temporary addresses can only be made by an
application. For example, some applications may always want to use
temporary addresses, while others may want to use them only in some
circumstances or not at all. An Application Programming Interface (API)
such as that specified in \[[RFC5014](#RFC5014){.xref}\] can enable
individual applications to indicate a preference for the use of
temporary addresses.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

[Section 2](#SECTION2){.xref} provides background information. [Section
3](#SECTION3){.xref} describes a procedure for generating temporary
addresses. [Section 4](#SECTION4){.xref} discusses implications of
changing IIDs. [Section 5](#changes){.xref} describes the changes from

### [1.2.](#section-1.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Problem Statement](#name-problem-statement){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-problem-statement}

Addresses generated using SLAAC \[[RFC4862](#RFC4862){.xref}\] contain
an embedded interface identifier, which may remain stable over time.
Anytime a fixed identifier is used in multiple contexts, it becomes
possible to correlate seemingly unrelated activity using this
identifier.[¶](#section-1.2-1){.pilcrow}

The correlation can be performed by:[¶](#section-1.2-2){.pilcrow}

-   [An attacker who is in the path between the host in question and the
    peer(s) to which it is communicating, who can view the IPv6
    addresses present in the
    datagrams.[¶](#section-1.2-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-1.2-3.1}
-   [An attacker who can access the communication logs of the peers with
    which the host has
    communicated.[¶](#section-1.2-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-1.2-3.2}

Since the identifier is embedded within the IPv6 address, it cannot be
hidden. This document proposes a solution to this issue by generating
interface identifiers that vary over time.[¶](#section-1.2-4){.pilcrow}

Note that an attacker, who is on path, may be able to perform
significant correlation based on:[¶](#section-1.2-5){.pilcrow}

-   [The payload contents of unencrypted packets on the
    wire.[¶](#section-1.2-6.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-1.2-6.1}
-   [The characteristics of the packets, such as packet size and
    timing.[¶](#section-1.2-6.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-1.2-6.2}

Use of temporary addresses will not prevent such correlation, nor will
it prevent an on-link observer (e.g., the host\'s default router) from
tracking all the host\'s addresses.[¶](#section-1.2-7){.pilcrow}

## [2.](#section-2){.section-number .selfRef} [Background](#name-background){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-background}

This section discusses the problem in more detail, provides context for
evaluating the significance of the concerns in specific environments,
and makes comparisons with existing
practices.[¶](#section-2-1){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-2.1 .section}
### [2.1.](#section-2.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Extended Use of the Same Identifier](#name-extended-use-of-the-same-id){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-extended-use-of-the-same-id}

The use of a non-changing IID to form addresses is a specific instance
of the more general case where a constant identifier is reused over an
extended period of time and in multiple independent activities. Anytime
the same identifier is used in multiple contexts, it becomes possible
for that identifier to be used to correlate seemingly unrelated
activity. For example, a network sniffer placed strategically on a link
traversed by all traffic to/from a particular host could keep track of
which destinations a host communicated with and at what times. In some
cases, such information can be used to infer things, such as what hours
an employee was active, when someone is at home, etc. Although it might
appear that changing an address regularly in such environments would be
desirable to lessen privacy concerns, it should be noted that the
network-prefix portion of an address also serves as a constant
identifier. All hosts at, say, a home would have the same network
prefix, which identifies the topological location of those hosts. This
has implications for privacy, though not at the same granularity as the
concern that this document addresses. Specifically, all hosts within a
home could be grouped together for the purposes of collecting
information. If the network contains a very small number of hosts \--
say, just one \-- changing just the IID will not enhance privacy, since
the prefix serves as a constant identifier.[¶](#section-2.1-1){.pilcrow}

One of the requirements for correlating seemingly unrelated activities
is the use (and reuse) of an identifier that is recognizable over time
within different contexts. IP addresses provide one obvious example, but
there are more. For example:[¶](#section-2.1-2){.pilcrow}

-   [Many hosts also have DNS names associated with their addresses, in
    which case, the DNS name serves as a similar identifier. Although
    the DNS name associated with an address is more work to obtain (it
    may require a DNS query), the information is often readily
    available. In such cases, changing the address on a host over time
    would do little to address the concerns raised in this document,
    unless the DNS name is also changed at the same time (see [Section
    4](#SECTION4){.xref}).[¶](#section-2.1-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.1-3.1}
-   [Web browsers and servers typically exchange \"cookies\" with each
    other \[[RFC6265](#RFC6265){.xref}\]. Cookies allow web servers to
    correlate a current activity with a previous activity. One common
    usage is to send back targeted advertising to a user by using the
    cookie supplied by the browser to identify what earlier queries had
    been made (e.g., for what type of information). Based on the earlier
    queries, advertisements can be targeted to match the (assumed)
    interests of the end
    user.[¶](#section-2.1-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.1-3.2}

The use of a constant identifier within an address is of special
concern, because addresses are a fundamental requirement of
communication and cannot easily be hidden from eavesdroppers and other
parties. Even when higher layers encrypt their payloads, addresses in
packet headers appear in the clear. Consequently, if a mobile host
(e.g., laptop) accessed the network from several different locations, an
eavesdropper might be able to track the movement of that mobile host
from place to place, even if the upper-layer payloads were
encrypted.[¶](#section-2.1-4){.pilcrow}

Changing addresses over time limits the time window over which
eavesdroppers and other information collectors may trivially correlate
network activity when the same address is employed for multiple
transactions by the same host. Additionally, it reduces the window of
exposure during which a host is accessible via an address that becomes
revealed as a result of active
communication.[¶](#section-2.1-5){.pilcrow}

The security and privacy implications of IPv6 addresses are discussed in
detail in \[[RFC7721](#RFC7721){.xref}\],
\[[RFC7707](#RFC7707){.xref}\], and
\[[RFC7217](#RFC7217){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2.1-6){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-2.2 .section}
### [2.2.](#section-2.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Possible Approaches](#name-possible-approaches){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-possible-approaches}

One approach, compatible with the SLAAC architecture, would be to change
the IID portion of an address over time. Changing the IID can make it
more difficult to look at the IP addresses in independent transactions
and identify which ones actually correspond to the same host, both in
the case where the routing-prefix portion of an address changes and when
it does not.[¶](#section-2.2-1){.pilcrow}

Many hosts function as both clients and servers. In such cases, the host
would need a name (e.g., a DNS domain name) for its use as a server.
Whether the address stays fixed or changes has little impact on privacy,
since the name remains constant and serves as a constant identifier.
However, when acting as a client (e.g., initiating communication), such
a host may want to vary the addresses it uses. In such environments, one
may need multiple addresses: a stable address associated with the name,
which is used to accept incoming connection requests from other hosts,
and a temporary address used to shield the identity of the client when
it initiates communication.[¶](#section-2.2-2){.pilcrow}

On the other hand, a host that functions only as a client may want to
employ only temporary addresses for public
communication.[¶](#section-2.2-3){.pilcrow}

To make it difficult to make educated guesses as to whether two
different IIDs belong to the same host, the algorithm for generating
alternate identifiers must include input that has an unpredictable
component from the perspective of the outside entities that are
collecting information.[¶](#section-2.2-4){.pilcrow}

### [3.1.](#section-3.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Design Guidelines](#name-design-guidelines){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-design-guidelines}

Temporary addresses observe the following
properties:[¶](#section-3.1-1){.pilcrow}

1.  [Temporary addresses are typically employed for initiating outgoing
    sessions.[¶](#section-3.1-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.1-2.1}
2.  [Temporary addresses are used for a short period of time (typically
    hours to days) and are subsequently deprecated. Deprecated addresses
    can continue to be used for established connections but are not used
    to initiate new
    connections.[¶](#section-3.1-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.1-2.2}
3.  [New temporary addresses are generated over time to replace
    temporary addresses that expire (i.e., become deprecated and
    eventually
    invalidated).[¶](#section-3.1-2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.1-2.3}
4.  [Temporary addresses must have a limited lifetime (limited \"valid
    lifetime\" and \"preferred lifetime\" from
    \[[RFC4862](#RFC4862){.xref}\]). The lifetime of an address should
    be further reduced when privacy-meaningful events (such as a host
    attaching to a different network, or the regeneration of a new
    randomized Media Access Control (MAC) address) take place. The
    lifetime of temporary addresses must be statistically different for
    different addresses, such that it is hard to predict or infer when a
    new temporary address is generated or correlate a newly generated
    address with an existing
    one.[¶](#section-3.1-2.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.1-2.4}
5.  [By default, one address is generated for each prefix advertised by
    SLAAC. The resulting interface identifiers must be statistically
    different when addresses are configured for different prefixes or
    different network interfaces. This means that, given two addresses,
    it must be difficult for an outside entity to infer whether the
    addresses correspond to the same host or network
    interface.[¶](#section-3.1-2.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.1-2.5}
6.  [It must be difficult for an outside entity to predict the interface
    identifiers that will be employed for temporary addresses, even with
    knowledge of the algorithm/method employed to generate them and/or
    knowledge of the IIDs previously employed for other temporary
    addresses. These IIDs must be semantically opaque
    \[[RFC7136](#RFC7136){.xref}\] and must not follow any specific
    patterns.[¶](#section-3.1-2.6){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.1-2.6}
:::
:::

::: {#section-3.2 .section}
### [3.2.](#section-3.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Assumptions](#name-assumptions){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-assumptions}

The following algorithm assumes that, for a given temporary address, an
implementation can determine the prefix from which it was generated.
When a temporary address is deprecated, a new temporary address is
generated. The specific valid and preferred lifetimes for the new
address are dependent on the corresponding lifetime values set for the
prefix from which it was generated.[¶](#section-3.2-1){.pilcrow}

Finally, this document assumes that, when a host initiates outgoing
communications, temporary addresses can be given preference over stable
addresses (if available), when the device is configured to do so.
\[[RFC6724](#RFC6724){.xref}\] mandates that implementations provide a
mechanism that allows an application to configure its preference for
temporary addresses over stable addresses. It also allows an
implementation to prefer temporary addresses by default, so that the
connections initiated by the host can use temporary addresses without
requiring application-specific enablement. This document also assumes
that an API will exist that allows individual applications to indicate
whether they prefer to use temporary or stable addresses and override
the system defaults (see, for example,

The following subsections specify example algorithms for generating

[Section 3.3.1](#randomized-IIDs){.xref} assumes a pseudorandom number

One approach is to select a pseudorandom number of the appropriate
length. A host employing this algorithm should generate IIDs as
follows:[¶](#section-3.3.1-1){.pilcrow}

    IIDs already employed in an address of the same network interface
    and the same network prefix. In the event that an unacceptable

When a temporary address becomes deprecated, a new one [MUST]{.bcp14} be
generated. This is done by repeating the actions described in [Section
3.4](#SECTION3_3){.xref}, starting at step 4). Note that, in normal
operation, except for the transient period when a temporary address is
being regenerated, at most one temporary address per prefix should be in
a nondeprecated state at any given time on a given interface. Note that
if a temporary address becomes deprecated as result of processing a
Prefix Information option with a zero preferred lifetime, then a new
temporary address [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be generated (in response to the
same Prefix Information option). To ensure that a preferred temporary
address is always available, a new temporary address [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be
regenerated slightly before its predecessor is deprecated. This is to
allow sufficient time to avoid race conditions in the case where
generating a new temporary address is not instantaneous, such as when
DAD must be performed. The host [SHOULD]{.bcp14} start the process of
address regeneration REGEN_ADVANCE time units before a temporary address
is deprecated.[¶](#section-3.5-1){.pilcrow}

As an optional optimization, an implementation [MAY]{.bcp14} remove a

### [3.6.](#section-3.6){.section-number .selfRef} [Regeneration of Temporary Addresses](#name-regeneration-of-temporary-a){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-regeneration-of-temporary-a}

The frequency at which temporary addresses change depends on how a
device is being used (e.g., how frequently it initiates new
communication) and the concerns of the end user. The most egregious
privacy concerns appear to involve addresses used for long periods of
time (from weeks to years). The more frequently an address changes, the
less feasible collecting or coordinating information keyed on IIDs
becomes. Moreover, the cost of collecting information and attempting to
correlate it based on IIDs will only be justified if enough addresses
contain non-changing identifiers to make it worthwhile. Thus, having
large numbers of clients change their address on a daily or weekly basis
is likely to be sufficient to alleviate most privacy
concerns.[¶](#section-3.6-1){.pilcrow}

There are also client costs associated with having a large number of
addresses associated with a host (e.g., in doing address lookups, the
need to join many multicast groups, etc.). Thus, changing addresses
frequently (e.g., every few minutes) may have performance
implications.[¶](#section-3.6-2){.pilcrow}

Hosts following this specification [SHOULD]{.bcp14} generate new
temporary addresses over time. This can be achieved by generating a new
temporary address REGEN_ADVANCE time units before a temporary address
becomes deprecated. As described above, this produces addresses with a
preferred lifetime no larger than TEMP_PREFERRED_LIFETIME. The value
DESYNC_FACTOR is a random value computed when a temporary address is
generated; it ensures that clients do not generate new addresses at a
fixed frequency and that clients do not synchronize with each other and
generate new addresses at exactly the same time. When the preferred
lifetime expires, a new temporary address [MUST]{.bcp14} be generated
using the algorithm specified in [Section 3.4](#SECTION3_3){.xref}
(starting at step 4).[¶](#section-3.6-3){.pilcrow}

Because the frequency at which it is appropriate to generate new
addresses varies from one environment to another, implementations
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} provide end users with the ability to change the
frequency at which addresses are regenerated. The default value is given
in TEMP_PREFERRED_LIFETIME and is one day. In addition, the exact time
at which to invalidate a temporary address depends on how applications
are used by end users. Thus, the suggested default value of two days
(TEMP_VALID_LIFETIME) may not be appropriate in all environments.
Implementations [SHOULD]{.bcp14} provide end users with the ability to
override both of these default values.[¶](#section-3.6-4){.pilcrow}

Finally, when an interface connects to a new (different) link, existing
temporary addresses for the corresponding interface [MUST]{.bcp14} be
removed, and new temporary addresses [MUST]{.bcp14} be generated for use
on the new link, using the algorithm in [Section
3.4](#SECTION3_3){.xref}. If a device moves from one link to another,
generating new temporary addresses ensures that the device uses
different randomized IIDs for the temporary addresses associated with
the two links, making it more difficult to correlate addresses from the
two different links as being from the same host. The host [MAY]{.bcp14}
follow any process available to it to determine that the link change has
occurred. One such process is described by \"Simple DNA\"
\[[RFC6059](#RFC6059){.xref}\]. Detecting link changes would prevent
link down/up events from causing temporary addresses to be
(unnecessarily) regenerated.[¶](#section-3.6-5){.pilcrow}

Devices implementing this specification [MUST]{.bcp14} provide a way for
the end user to explicitly enable or disable the use of temporary
addresses. In addition, a site might wish to disable the use of
temporary addresses in order to simplify network debugging and
operations. Consequently, implementations [SHOULD]{.bcp14} provide a way
for trusted system administrators to enable or disable the use of
temporary addresses.[¶](#section-3.7-1){.pilcrow}

Additionally, sites might wish to selectively enable or disable the use
of temporary addresses for some prefixes. For example, a site might wish
to disable temporary-address generation for ULA
\[[RFC4193](#RFC4193){.xref}\] prefixes while still generating temporary
addresses for all other prefixes advertised via PIOs for address
configuration. Another site might wish to enable temporary-address
generation only for the prefixes 2001:db8:1::/48 and 2001:db8:2::/48
while disabling it for all other prefixes. To support this behavior,
implementations [SHOULD]{.bcp14} provide a way to enable and disable
generation of temporary addresses for specific prefix subranges. This
per-prefix setting [SHOULD]{.bcp14} override the global settings on the
host with respect to the specified prefix subranges. Note that the

The desire to protect individual privacy can conflict with the desire to
effectively maintain and debug a network. Having clients use addresses
that change over time will make it more difficult to track down and
isolate operational problems. For example, when looking at packet

It is currently recommended that network deployments provide multiple
IPv6 addresses from each prefix to general-purpose hosts
\[[RFC7934](#RFC7934){.xref}\]. However, in some scenarios, use of a
large number of IPv6 addresses may have negative implications on network
devices that need to maintain entries for each IPv6 address in some data
structures (e.g., SAVI \[[RFC7039](#RFC7039){.xref}\]). For example,
concurrent active use of multiple IPv6 addresses will increase Neighbor
Discovery traffic if Neighbor Caches in network devices are not large
enough to store all addresses on the link. This can impact performance
and energy efficiency on networks on which multicast is expensive (see
e.g.,
\[[MCAST-PROBLEMS](#I-D.ietf-mboned-ieee802-mcast-problems){.xref}\]).
Additionally, some network-security devices might incorrectly infer IPv6
address forging if temporary addresses are regenerated at a high
rate.[¶](#section-4-2){.pilcrow}

The use of temporary addresses may cause unexpected difficulties with
some applications. For example, some servers refuse to accept
communications from clients for which they cannot map the IP address
into a DNS name. That is, they perform a DNS PTR query to determine the
DNS name corresponding to an IPv6 address, and may then also perform a
AAAA query on the returned name to verify it maps back into the same
address. Consequently, clients not properly registered in the DNS may be
unable to access some services. However, a host\'s DNS name (if
non-changing) would serve as a constant identifier. The wide deployment
of the extension described in this document could challenge the practice
of inverse-DNS-based \"validation\", which has little validity, though
it is widely implemented. In order to meet server challenges, hosts
could register temporary addresses in the DNS using random names (for
example, a string version of the random address itself), albeit at the
expense of increased complexity.[¶](#section-4-3){.pilcrow}

In addition, some applications may not behave robustly if an address
becomes invalid while it is still in use by the application or if the
application opens multiple sessions and expects them to all use the same
address.[¶](#section-4-4){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC4941](#RFC4941){.xref}\] employed a randomized temporary IID for
generating a set of temporary addresses, such that temporary addresses
configured at a given time for multiple SLAAC prefixes would employ the
same IID. Sharing the same IID among multiple addresses allowed a host
to join only one solicited-node multicast group per temporary address
set.[¶](#section-4-5){.pilcrow}

This document requires that the IIDs of all temporary addresses on a
host are statistically different from each other. This means that when a
network employs multiple prefixes, each temporary address of a set will
result in a different solicited-node multicast address, and, thus, the
number of multicast groups that a host must join becomes a function of
the number of SLAAC prefixes employed for generating temporary
addresses.[¶](#section-4-6){.pilcrow}

Thus, a network that employs multiple prefixes may require hosts to join
more multicast groups than in the case of implementations of RFC 4941.
If the number of multicast groups were large enough, a host might need
to resort to setting the network interface card to promiscuous mode.
This could cause the host to process more packets than strictly
necessary and might have a negative impact on battery life and system
performance in general.[¶](#section-4-7){.pilcrow}

We note that since this document reduces the default TEMP_VALID_LIFETIME
from 7 days (in \[[RFC4941](#RFC4941){.xref}\]) to 2 days, the number of
concurrent temporary addresses per SLAAC prefix will be smaller than for
RFC 4941 implementations; thus, the number of multicast groups for a
network that employs, say, between 1 and 3 prefixes, will be similar to
the number of such groups for RFC 4941
implementations.[¶](#section-4-8){.pilcrow}

Implementations concerned with the maximum number of multicast groups
that would be required to join as a result of configured addresses, or
the overall number of configured addresses, should consider enforcing
implementation-specific limits on, e.g., the maximum number of
configured addresses, the maximum number of SLAAC prefixes that are
employed for autoconfiguration, and/or the maximum ratio for
TEMP_VALID_LIFETIME/TEMP_PREFERRED_LIFETIME (which ultimately controls
the approximate number of concurrent temporary addresses per SLAAC
prefix). Many of these configuration limits are readily available in
SLAAC and RFC 4941 implementations. We note that these configurable
limits are meant to prevent pathological behaviors (as opposed to simply
limiting the usage of IPv6 addresses), since IPv6 implementations are
expected to leverage the usage of multiple addresses

This section summarizes the substantive changes in this document
relative to RFC 4941.[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

Broadly speaking, this document introduces the following
changes:[¶](#section-5-2){.pilcrow}

-   [Addresses a number of flaws in the algorithm for generating
    temporary addresses. The aforementioned flaws include the use of MD5
    for computing the temporary IIDs, and reusing the same IID for
    multiple prefixes (see \[[RAID2015](#RAID2015){.xref}\] and
    \[[RFC7721](#RFC7721){.xref}\] for further
    details).[¶](#section-5-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-5-3.1}

-   [Allows hosts to employ only temporary addresses.
    \[[RFC4941](#RFC4941){.xref}\] assumed that temporary addresses were
    configured in addition to stable addresses. This document does not
    imply or require the configuration of stable addresses; thus,
    implementations can now configure both stable and temporary
    addresses or temporary addresses
    only.[¶](#section-5-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-5-3.2}

-   [Removes the recommendation that temporary addresses be disabled by
    default. This is in line with BCP 188
    (\[[RFC7258](#RFC7258){.xref}\]) and also with BCP 204
    (\[[RFC7934](#RFC7934){.xref}\]).[¶](#section-5-3.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-5-3.3}

-   [Reduces the default maximum valid lifetime for temporary addresses
    (TEMP_VALID_LIFETIME). TEMP_VALID_LIFETIME has been reduced from 1
    week to 2 days, decreasing the typical number of concurrent
    temporary addresses from 7 to 3. This reduces the possible stress on
    network elements (see [Section 4](#SECTION4){.xref} for further
    details).[¶](#section-5-3.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-5-3.4}

-   [DESYNC_FACTOR is computed each time a temporary address is
    generated and is associated with the corresponding temporary
    address, such that each temporary address has a statistically
    different preferred lifetime, and thus temporary addresses are not
    generated at any specific
    frequency.[¶](#section-5-3.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-5-3.5}

-   [Changes the requirement to not try to regenerate temporary
    addresses upon TEMP_IDGEN_RETRIES consecutive DAD failures from
    \"[MUST NOT]{.bcp14}\" to \"[SHOULD
    NOT]{.bcp14}\".[¶](#section-5-3.6){.pilcrow}]{#section-5-3.6}

-   [The discussion about the security and privacy implications of
    different address generation techniques has been replaced with
    references to recent work in this area
    (\[[RFC7707](#RFC7707){.xref}\], \[[RFC7721](#RFC7721){.xref}\], and
    \[[RFC7217](#RFC7217){.xref}\]).[¶](#section-5-3.7){.pilcrow}]{#section-5-3.7}

    This document incorporates errata submitted (at the time of writing)
    for \[[RFC4941](#RFC4941){.xref}\] by [Jiri Bohac]{.contact-name}

An implementation might want to keep track of which addresses are being
used by upper layers so as to be able to remove a deprecated temporary
address from internal data structures once no upper-layer protocols are
using it (but not before). This is in contrast to current approaches,
where addresses are removed from an interface when they become invalid
\[[RFC4862](#RFC4862){.xref}\], independent of whether or not
upper-layer protocols are still using them. For TCP connections, such
information is available in control blocks. For UDP-based applications,
it may be the case that only the applications have knowledge about what
addresses are actually in use. Consequently, an implementation generally
will need to use heuristics in deciding when an address is no longer in
use.[¶](#section-6-1){.pilcrow}

If a very small number of hosts (say, only one) use a given prefix for
extended periods of time, just changing the interface-identifier part of
the address may not be sufficient to mitigate address-based
network-activity correlation, since the prefix acts as a constant
identifier. The procedures described in this document are most effective
when the prefix is reasonably nonstatic or used by a fairly large number
of hosts. Additionally, if a temporary address is used in a session
where the user authenticates, any notion of \"privacy\" for that address
is compromised for the party or parties that receive the authentication
information.[¶](#section-8-1){.pilcrow}

While this document discusses ways to limit the lifetime of interface
identifiers to reduce the ability of attackers to perform address-based
network-activity correlation, the method described is believed to be
ineffective against sophisticated forms of traffic analysis. To increase
effectiveness, one may need to consider the use of more advanced
techniques, such as onion routing
\[[ONION](#ONION){.xref}\].[¶](#section-8-2){.pilcrow}

Ingress filtering has been and is being deployed as a means of
preventing the use of spoofed source addresses in Distributed Denial of
Service (DDoS) attacks. In a network with a large number of hosts, new
temporary addresses are created at a fairly high rate. This might make
it difficult for ingress-/egress-filtering mechanisms to distinguish
between legitimately changing temporary addresses and spoofed source
addresses, which are \"in-prefix\" (using a topologically correct prefix
and nonexistent interface identifier). This can be addressed by using
access-control mechanisms on a per-address basis on the network ingress
point \-- though, as noted in [Section 4](#SECTION4){.xref}, there are
corresponding costs for doing so.[¶](#section-8-3){.pilcrow}
