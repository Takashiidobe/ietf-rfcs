# RFC 9099 {#rfcnum}

# Operational Security Considerations for IPv6 Networks {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

Knowledge and experience on how to operate IPv4 networks securely is
available, whether the operator is an Internet Service Provider (ISP) or
an enterprise internal network. However, IPv6 presents some new security
challenges. RFC 4942 describes security issues in the protocol, but
network managers also need a more practical, operations-minded document
to enumerate advantages and/or disadvantages of certain
choices.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

This document analyzes the operational security issues associated with
several types of networks and proposes technical and procedural
mitigation techniques. This document is only applicable to managed
networks, such as enterprise networks, service provider networks, or
managed residential networks.[¶](#section-abstract-2){.pilcrow}

Running an IPv6 network is new for most operators not only because they
are not yet used to large-scale IPv6 networks but also because there are
subtle but critical and important differences between IPv4 and IPv6,
especially with respect to security. For example, all Layer 2 (L2)
interactions are now done using the Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP)
\[[RFC4861](#RFC4861){.xref}\] rather than the Address Resolution
Protocol \[[RFC0826](#RFC0826){.xref}\]. Also, there is no Network
Address Port Translation (NAPT) defined in
\[[RFC2663](#RFC2663){.xref}\] for IPv6 even if
\[[RFC6296](#RFC6296){.xref}\] specifies an IPv6-to-IPv6 Network Prefix
Translation (NPTv6), which is a 1-to-1 mapping of IPv6 addresses.
Another important difference is that IPv6 is extensible with the use of
extension headers.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

IPv6 networks are deployed using a variety of techniques, each of which
have their own specific security concerns.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

This document complements \[[RFC4942](#RFC4942){.xref}\] by listing
security issues when operating a network (including various transition
technologies). It also provides operational deployment experiences where
warranted.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

This document is applicable to managed networks, i.e., when the network
is operated by the user organization itself. Indeed, many of the
recommended mitigation techniques must be configured with detailed
knowledge of the network (which are the default routers, the switch
trunk ports, etc.). This covers Service Providers (SPs), enterprise
networks, and some knowledgeable home-user-managed residential networks.
This applicability statement especially applies to Sections
[2.3](#linklayer){.xref} and
[2.5.4](#rfilter){.xref}.[¶](#section-1.1-1){.pilcrow}

### [2.1.](#section-2.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Addressing](#name-addressing){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-addressing}

IPv6 address allocations and overall architecture are important parts of
securing IPv6. Initial designs, even if intended to be temporary, tend
to last much longer than expected. Although IPv6 was initially thought
to make renumbering easy, in practice, it may be extremely difficult to
renumber without a proper IP Address Management (IPAM) system.
\[[RFC7010](#RFC7010){.xref}\] introduces the mechanisms that could be
utilized for IPv6 site renumbering and tries to cover most of the
explicit issues and requirements associated with IPv6
renumbering.[¶](#section-2.1-1){.pilcrow}

A key task for a successful IPv6 deployment is to prepare an addressing
plan. Because an abundance of address space is available, structuring an
address plan around both services and geographic locations allows
address space to become a basis for more structured security policies to
permit or deny services between geographic regions.
\[[RFC6177](#RFC6177){.xref}\] documents some operational considerations
of using different prefix sizes for address assignments at end
sites.[¶](#section-2.1-2){.pilcrow}

A common question is whether companies should use Provider-Independent
(PI) or Provider-Aggregated (PA) space \[[RFC7381](#RFC7381){.xref}\],
but, from a security perspective, there is little difference. However,
one aspect to keep in mind is who has administrative ownership of the

to enforce restrictions on routability of the space, e.g., due to
malicious criminal activity originating from it. Relying on PA address
space may also increase the perceived need for address translation
techniques, such as NPTv6; thereby, the complexity of the operations,
including the security operations, is
augmented.[¶](#section-2.1-3){.pilcrow}

In \[[RFC7934](#RFC7934){.xref}\], it is recommended that IPv6 network
deployments provide multiple IPv6 addresses from each prefix to
general-purpose hosts, and it specifically does not recommend limiting a
host to only one IPv6 address per prefix. It also recommends that the
network give the host the ability to use new addresses without requiring
explicit requests (for example, by using Stateless Address
Autoconfiguration (SLAAC)). Privacy extensions, as of
\[[RFC8981](#RFC8981){.xref}\], constitute one of the main scenarios
where hosts are expected to generate multiple addresses from the same
prefix, and having multiple IPv6 addresses per interface is a major
change compared to the unique IPv4 address per interface for hosts
(secondary IPv4 addresses are not common), especially for audits (see

Unique Local Addresses (ULAs) \[[RFC4193](#RFC4193){.xref}\] are

Some environments are also using link-local addressing for

Many operators reserve a /64 block for all loopback addresses in their

When considering how to assign stable addresses for nodes (either by
static configuration or by pre-provisioned DHCPv6 lease ([Section
2.1.6](#dhcp){.xref})), it is necessary to take into consideration the
effectiveness of perimeter security in a given
environment.[¶](#section-2.1.4-1){.pilcrow}

There is a trade-off between ease of operation (where some portions of
the IPv6 address could be easily recognizable for operational debugging
and troubleshooting) versus the risk of trivial scanning used for
reconnaissance. \[[SCANNING](#SCANNING){.xref}\] shows that there are
scientifically based mechanisms that make scanning for IPv6-reachable
nodes more feasible than expected; see
\[[RFC7707](#RFC7707){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2.1.4-2){.pilcrow}

Stable addresses also allow easy enforcement of a security policy at the
perimeter based on IPv6 addresses. For example, [Manufacturer Usage
Description (MUD)](#RFC8520){.xref} \[[RFC8520](#RFC8520){.xref}\] is a
mechanism where the perimeter defense can retrieve the security policy
template based on the type of internal device and apply the right
security policy based on the device\'s IPv6
address.[¶](#section-2.1.4-3){.pilcrow}

The use of well-known IPv6 addresses (such as ff02::1 for all link-local
nodes) or the use of commonly repeated addresses could make it easy to
figure out which devices are name servers, routers, or other critical
devices; even a simple traceroute will expose most of the routers on a
path. There are many scanning techniques possible and operators should
not rely on the \'impossible to find because my address is random\'
paradigm (a.k.a. \"security by obscurity\") even if it is common
practice to have the stable addresses randomly distributed across /64
subnets and to always use DNS (as IPv6 addresses are hard for human
brains to remember).[¶](#section-2.1.4-4){.pilcrow}

While, in some environments, obfuscating addresses could be considered
an added benefit, it should not preclude enforcement of perimeter rules.
Stable addresses following some logical allocation scheme may ease the
operation (as simplicity always helps
security).[¶](#section-2.1.4-5){.pilcrow}

Typical deployments will have a mix of stable and non-stable addresses;

#### [2.1.5.](#section-2.1.5){.section-number .selfRef} [Temporary Addresses for SLAAC](#name-temporary-addresses-for-sla){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-temporary-addresses-for-sla}

Historically, Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) makes up the
globally unique IPv6 address based on an automatically generated 64-bit
interface identifier (IID) based on the 64-bit Extended Unique
Identifier (EUI-64) Media Access Control (MAC) address combined with the
/64 prefix (received in the Prefix Information Option (PIO) of the
Router Advertisement (RA)). The EUI-64 address is generated from the
stable 48-bit MAC address and does not change even if the host moves to
another network; this is of course bad for privacy, as a host can be
traced from network (home) to network (office or Wi-Fi in hotels).
\[[RFC8064](#RFC8064){.xref}\] recommends against the use of EUI-64
addresses, and it must be noted that most host operating systems do not
use EUI-64 addresses anymore and rely on either
\[[RFC8981](#RFC8981){.xref}\] or
\[[RFC8064](#RFC8064){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2.1.5-1){.pilcrow}

Randomly generating an interface ID, as described in
\[[RFC8981](#RFC8981){.xref}\], is part of SLAAC with so-called privacy
extension addresses and is used to address some privacy concerns.
Privacy extension addresses, a.k.a. temporary addresses, may help to
mitigate the correlation of activities of a node within the same network
and may also reduce the attack exposure window. But using privacy
extension addresses as described in \[[RFC8981](#RFC8981){.xref}\] might
prevent the operator from building host-specific access control lists
(ACLs). These privacy extension addresses could also be used to
obfuscate some malevolent activities, and specific user
attribution/accountability procedures should be put in place, as
described in [Section 2.6](#log){.xref}.[¶](#section-2.1.5-2){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC8064](#RFC8064){.xref}\] combined with the address generation
mechanism of \[[RFC7217](#RFC7217){.xref}\] specifies another way to
generate an address while still keeping the same IID for each network
prefix; this allows SLAAC nodes to always have the same stable IPv6
address on a specific network while having different IPv6 addresses on
different networks.[¶](#section-2.1.5-3){.pilcrow}

In some specific use cases where user accountability is more important
than user privacy, network operators may consider disabling SLAAC and
relying only on DHCPv6; however, not all operating systems support
DHCPv6, so some hosts will not get any IPv6 connectivity. Disabling
SLAAC and privacy extension addresses can be done for most operating
systems by sending RA messages with a hint to get addresses via DHCPv6
by setting the M-bit and disabling SLAAC by resetting all A-bits in all
PIOs. However, attackers could still find ways to bypass this mechanism
if it is not enforced at the switch/router
level.[¶](#section-2.1.5-4){.pilcrow}

However, in scenarios where anonymity is a strong desire (protecting
user privacy is more important than user attribution), privacy extension
addresses should be used. When mechanisms recommended by
\[[RFC8064](#RFC8064){.xref}\] are available, the stable privacy address
is probably a good balance between privacy (among different networks)
and security/user attribution (within a
network).[¶](#section-2.1.5-5){.pilcrow}

in order to ensure auditability and traceability (see [Section

auditability).[¶](#section-2.1.6-1){.pilcrow}

A main security concern is the ability to detect and counteract rogue
DHCP servers ([Section 2.3.3](#snoop){.xref}). It must be noted that, as
opposed to DHCPv4, DHCPv6 can lease several IPv6 addresses per client.
For DHCPv4, the lease is bound to the \'client identifier\', which may
contain a hardware address or another type of identifier, such as a DNS
name. For DHCPv6, the lease is bound to the client DHCP Unique
Identifier (DUID), which may or may not be bound to the client L2
address. \[[RFC7824](#RFC7824){.xref}\] describes the privacy issues

Extension headers are an important difference between IPv4 and IPv6. In
IPv4-based packets, it\'s trivial to find the upper-layer protocol type
and protocol header, while, in IPv6, it is more complex since the
extension header chain must be parsed completely (even if not processed)
in order to find the upper-layer protocol header. IANA has closed the
existing empty \"Next Header Types\" registry to new entries and is
redirecting its users to the \"IPv6 Extension Header Types\" registry,
per \[[RFC7045](#RFC7045){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2.2-1){.pilcrow}

Extension headers have also become a very controversial topic since
forwarding nodes that discard packets containing extension headers are
known to cause connectivity failures and deployment problems
\[[RFC7872](#RFC7872){.xref}\]. Understanding the role of various
extension headers is important, and this section enumerates the ones
that need careful consideration.[¶](#section-2.2-2){.pilcrow}

A clarification on how intermediate nodes should handle packets with
existing or future extension headers is found in
\[[RFC7045](#RFC7045){.xref}\]. The uniform TLV format to be used for
defining future extension headers is described in
\[[RFC6564](#RFC6564){.xref}\]. Sections
[5.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8504#section-5.2){.relref} and

processing of extension headers by IPv6
nodes.[¶](#section-2.2-3){.pilcrow}

Vendors of filtering solutions and operations personnel responsible for
implementing packet filtering rules should be aware that the \'Next
Header\' field in an IPv6 header can both point to an IPv6 extension
header or to an upper-layer protocol header. This has to be considered
when designing the user interface of filtering solutions or during the
creation of filtering rule sets.[¶](#section-2.2-4){.pilcrow}

While \[[RFC8200](#RFC8200){.xref}\] recommends the order and the
maximum repetition of extension headers, at the time of writing, there

headers). The same applies for options contained in the extension

IPv6 relies heavily on NDP \[[RFC4861](#RFC4861){.xref}\] to perform a
variety of link operations, such as discovering other nodes on the link,
resolving their link-layer addresses, and finding routers on the link.
If not secured, NDP is vulnerable to various attacks, such as

\[[RFC6583](#RFC6583){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2.3-1){.pilcrow}

Most of the issues are only applicable when the attacker is on the same

NDP can be vulnerable to remote DoS attacks, for example, when a router
is forced to perform address resolution for a large number of unassigned
addresses, i.e., when a prefix is scanned by an attacker in a fast
manner. This can keep new devices from joining the network or render the

Router Advertisement spoofing is a well-known, on-link attack vector and
has been extensively documented. The presence of rogue RAs, either
unintentional or malicious, can cause partial or complete failure of
operation of hosts on an IPv6 link. For example, a node can select an
incorrect router address, which can then be used for an on-path attack,
or the node can assume wrong prefixes to be used for SLAAC.
\[[RFC6104](#RFC6104){.xref}\] summarizes the scenarios in which rogue
RAs may be observed and presents a list of possible solutions to the
problem. \[[RFC6105](#RFC6105){.xref}\] (RA-Guard) describes a solution
framework for the rogue RA problem where network segments are designed
around switching devices that are capable of identifying invalid RAs and
blocking them before the attack packets actually reach the target
nodes.[¶](#section-2.3.2.1-1){.pilcrow}

However, several evasion techniques that circumvent the protection
provided by RA-Guard have surfaced. A key challenge to this mitigation
technique is introduced by IPv6 fragmentation. Attackers can conceal
their attack by fragmenting their packets into multiple fragments such
that the switching device that is responsible for blocking invalid RAs
cannot find all the necessary information to perform packet filtering of
the same packet. \[[RFC7113](#RFC7113){.xref}\] describes such evasion
techniques and provides advice to RA-Guard implementers such that the
aforementioned evasion vectors can be

##### [2.3.2.3.](#section-2.3.2.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Host Isolation](#name-host-isolation){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-host-isolation}

Isolating hosts for the NDP traffic can be done by using a /64 per host,
refer to [Section 2.1.8](#sixty4perhost){.xref}, as NDP is only relevant
within a /64 on-link prefix; 3GPP ([Section 2.3.4](#threegpp){.xref})
uses a similar mechanism.[¶](#section-2.3.2.3-1){.pilcrow}

A more drastic technique to prevent all NDP attacks is based on
isolation of all hosts with specific configurations. In such a scenario,
hosts (i.e., all nodes that are not routers) are unable to send
data-link layer frames to other hosts; therefore, no host-to-host
attacks can happen. This specific setup can be established on some
switches or Wi-Fi access points. This is not always feasible when hosts
need to communicate with other hosts in the same subnet, e.g., for
access to file shares.[¶](#section-2.3.2.3-2){.pilcrow}

It is still recommended that RA-Guard and SAVI be employed as a first
line of defense against common attack vectors, including misconfigured
hosts. This recommendation also applies when DHCPv6 is used, as RA
messages are used to discover the default router(s) and for on-link
prefix determination. This line of defense is most effective when
incomplete fragments are dropped by routers and L2 switches, as
described in [Section 2.2.3](#fragments){.xref}. The generated log
should also be analyzed to identify and act on
violations.[¶](#section-2.3.2.4-1){.pilcrow}

Network operators should be aware that RA-Guard and SAVI do not work as
expected or could even be harmful in specific network configurations
(notably when there could be multiple
routers).[¶](#section-2.3.2.4-2){.pilcrow}

Enabling RA-Guard by default in managed networks (e.g., Wi-Fi networks,
enterprise campus networks, etc.) should be strongly considered except
for specific use cases, such as in the presence of homenet devices
emitting router advertisements.[¶](#section-2.3.2.4-3){.pilcrow}

The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6), as described
in \[[RFC8415](#RFC8415){.xref}\], enables DHCP servers to pass
configuration parameters, such as IPv6 network addresses and other
configuration information, to IPv6 nodes. DHCP plays an important role
in most large networks by providing robust stateful configuration in the
context of automated system provisioning.[¶](#section-2.3.3-1){.pilcrow}

The two most common threats to DHCP clients come from malicious (a.k.a.
rogue) or unintentionally misconfigured DHCP servers. In these
scenarios, a malicious DHCP server is established with the intent of
providing incorrect configuration information to the clients to cause a
denial-of-service attack or to mount an on-path attack. While
unintentional, a misconfigured DHCP server can have the same impact.
Additional threats against DHCP are discussed in the security
considerations section of
\[[RFC8415](#RFC8415){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2.3.3-2){.pilcrow}

[DHCPv6-Shield](#RFC7610){.xref} \[[RFC7610](#RFC7610){.xref}\]
specifies a mechanism for protecting connected DHCPv6 clients against
rogue DHCPv6 servers. This mechanism is based on DHCPv6 packet filtering
at the L2 device, i.e., the administrator specifies the interfaces
connected to DHCPv6 servers. However, extension headers could be
leveraged to bypass DHCPv6-Shield unless \[[RFC7112](#RFC7112){.xref}\]
is enforced.[¶](#section-2.3.3-3){.pilcrow}

The 3GPP link is a point-to-point-like link that has no link-layer
address. This implies there can only be one end host (the mobile
handset) and the first-hop router (i.e., a Gateway GPRS Support Node
(GGSN) or a Packet Data Network Gateway (PGW)) on that link. The
GGSN/PGW never configures a non-link-local address on the link using the
advertised /64 prefix on it; see [Section 2.1.8](#sixty4perhost){.xref}.
The advertised prefix must not be used for on-link determination. There
is no need for address resolution on the 3GPP link, since there are no
link-layer addresses. Furthermore, the GGSN/PGW assigns a prefix that is
unique within each 3GPP link that uses IPv6 Stateless Address
Autoconfiguration. This avoids the necessity to perform DAD at the
network level for every address generated by the mobile host. The
GGSN/PGW always provides an IID to the cellular host for the purpose of
configuring the link-local address and ensures the uniqueness of the IID
on the link (i.e., no collisions between its own link-local address and
the mobile host\'s address).[¶](#section-2.3.4-1){.pilcrow}

The 3GPP link model itself mitigates most of the known NDP-related DoS
attacks. In practice, the GGSN/PGW only needs to route all traffic to
the mobile host that falls under the prefix assigned to it. As there is
also a single host on the 3GPP link, there is no need to defend that
IPv6 address.[¶](#section-2.3.4-2){.pilcrow}

IPv6 uses multicast extensively for signaling messages on the local link
to avoid broadcast messages for on-the-wire
efficiency.[¶](#section-2.3.5-1){.pilcrow}

The use of multicast has some side effects on wireless networks, such as
a negative impact on battery life of smartphones and other
battery-operated devices that are connected to such networks.
\[[RFC7772](#RFC7772){.xref}\] and \[[RFC6775](#RFC6775){.xref}\] (for
specific wireless networks) discuss methods to rate-limit RAs and other
ND messages on wireless networks in order to address this
issue.[¶](#section-2.3.5-2){.pilcrow}

The use of link-layer multicast addresses (e.g., ff02::1 for the all
nodes link-local multicast address) could also be misused for an
amplification attack. Imagine a hostile node sending an ICMPv6
ECHO_REQUEST to ff02::1 with a spoofed source address, then all
link-local nodes will reply with ICMPv6 ECHO_REPLY packets to the source
address. This could be a DoS attack for the address owner. This attack
is purely local to the L2 network, as packets with a link-local
destination are never forwarded by an IPv6
router.[¶](#section-2.3.5-3){.pilcrow}

This is the reason why large Wi-Fi network deployments often limit the
use of link-layer multicast, either from or to the uplink of the Wi-Fi
access point, i.e., Wi-Fi stations are prevented to send link-local
multicast to their direct neighboring Wi-Fi stations; this policy also
blocks service discovery via Multicast DNS (mDNS)

ensure that the sender of a Neighbor Discovery message is the actual
\"owner\" of the claimed IPv6 address. A new NDP option, the CGA option,
was introduced and is used to carry the public key and associated

\[[RFC6192](#RFC6192){.xref}\] defines the router control plane and
provides detailed guidance to secure it for IPv4 and IPv6 networks. This
definition is repeated here for the reader\'s convenience. Please note
that the definition is completely protocol-version agnostic (most of
this section applies to IPv6 in the same way as to
IPv4).[¶](#section-2.4-1){.pilcrow}

Preamble: IPv6 control plane security is vastly congruent with its IPv4
equivalent, with the exception of OSPFv3 authentication ([Section
2.4.1](#control){.xref}) and some packet exceptions (see [Section
2.4.3](#exception){.xref}) that are specific to
IPv6.[¶](#section-2.4-2.1){.pilcrow}

Modern router architecture design maintains a strict separation of
forwarding and router control plane hardware and software. The router
control plane supports routing and management functions. It is generally
described as the router architecture hardware and software components
for handling packets destined to the device itself as well as building
and sending packets originated locally on the device. The forwarding
plane is typically described as the router architecture hardware and
software components responsible for receiving a packet on an incoming
interface, performing a lookup to identify the packet\'s IP next hop and
best outgoing interface towards the destination, and forwarding the
packet through the appropriate outgoing
interface.[¶](#section-2.4-3){.pilcrow}

While the forwarding plane is usually implemented in high-speed
hardware, the control plane is implemented by a generic processor
(referred to as the routing processor (RP)) and cannot process packets
at a high rate. Hence, this processor can be attacked by flooding its
input queue with more packets than it can process. The control plane
processor is then unable to process valid control packets and the router
can lose IGP or BGP adjacencies, which can cause a severe network
disruption.[¶](#section-2.4-4){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC6192](#RFC6192){.xref}\] provides detailed guidance to protect the
router control plane in IPv6 networks. The rest of this section contains
simplified guidance.[¶](#section-2.4-5){.pilcrow}

The mitigation techniques are:[¶](#section-2.4-6){.pilcrow}

-   [to drop illegitimate or potentially harmful control packets before
    they are queued to the RP (this can be done by a forwarding plane
    ACL) and[¶](#section-2.4-7.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.4-7.1}
-   [to rate-limit the remaining packets to a rate that the RP can
    sustain. Protocol-specific protection should also be done (for
    example, a spoofed OSPFv3 packet could trigger the execution of the
    Dijkstra algorithm; therefore, the frequency of Dijkstra
    calculations should also be rate
    limited).[¶](#section-2.4-7.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.4-7.2}

packets:[¶](#section-2.4-8){.pilcrow}

-   [processing of the hop-by-hop options header; new implementations

    or[¶](#section-2.4.3-2.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.4.3-2.4}
-   [more specific to some router implementations, an oversized

    cannot force the packet to be punted to the
    RP.[¶](#section-2.4.3-2.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.4.3-2.5}

On some routers, not everything can be done by the specialized data
plane hardware that requires some packets to be \'punted\' to the
generic RP. This could include, for example, the processing of a long
extension header chain in order to apply an ACL based on Layer 4
information. \[[RFC6980](#RFC6980){.xref}\] and more generally
\[[RFC7112](#RFC7112){.xref}\] highlight the security implications of
oversized extension header chains on routers and update the original
IPv6 specifications \[[RFC2460](#RFC2460){.xref}\] such that the first
fragment of a packet is required to contain the entire IPv6 header
chain. Those changes are incorporated in the IPv6 standard
\[[RFC8200](#RFC8200){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2.4.3-3){.pilcrow}

An ingress ACL cannot mitigate a control plane attack using these packet
exceptions. The only protection for the RP is to rate-limit those packet
exceptions that are forwarded to the RP. This means that some data plane
packets will be dropped without an ICMP message sent to the source,
which may delay Path MTU Discovery and cause
drops.[¶](#section-2.4.3-4){.pilcrow}

In addition to limiting the rate of data plane packets queued to the RP,
it is also important to rate-limit the generation of ICMP messages. This
is important both to preserve RP resources and also to prevent an
amplification attack using the router as a reflector. It is worth noting
that some platforms implement this rate-limiting in hardware. Of course,
a consequence of not generating an ICMP message will break some IPv6
mechanisms, such as Path MTU Discovery or a simple
traceroute.[¶](#section-2.4.3-5){.pilcrow}

Preamble: IPv6 routing security is congruent with IPv4 routing security,
with the exception of OSPv3 neighbor authentication (see [Section

that routing protocol packets are coming from the local network; it must

OSPFv3 can rely on IPsec to fulfill the authentication function.
Operators should note that IPsec support is not standard on all routing
platforms. In some cases, this requires specialized hardware that
offloads crypto over to dedicated Application-Specific Integrated
Circuits (ASICs) or enhanced software images (both of which often come
with added financial cost) to provide such functionality. An added
detail is to determine whether OSPFv3 IPsec implementations use AH or
ESP-NULL for integrity protection. In early implementations, all OSPFv3
IPsec configurations relied on AH since the details weren\'t specified
in \[[RFC5340](#RFC5340){.xref}\]. However, the document that
specifically describes how IPsec should be implemented for OSPFv3
\[[RFC4552](#RFC4552){.xref}\] states that \"implementations
[MUST]{.bcp14} support ESP\[-NULL\] and [MAY]{.bcp14} support AH\" since
it follows the overall IPsec standards wording. OSPFv3 can also use
normal ESP to encrypt the OSPFv3 payload to provide confidentiality for
the routing information.[¶](#section-2.5.2-1){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC7166](#RFC7166){.xref}\] changes OSPFv3 reliance on IPsec by
appending an authentication trailer to the end of the OSPFv3 packets. It
does not authenticate the specific originator of an OSPFv3 packet;
rather, it allows a router to confirm that the packet has been issued by
a router that had access to the shared authentication
key.[¶](#section-2.5.2-2){.pilcrow}

With all authentication mechanisms, operators should confirm that
implementations can support rekeying mechanisms that do not cause
outages. There have been instances where any rekeying causes outages;
therefore, the trade-off between utilizing this functionality needs to
be weighed against the protection it provides.

routing information, is encrypted using IPsec. However, in practice,
deploying IPsec is not always feasible given hardware and software
limitations of the various platforms

    Interface (CLI) or another monitoring
    mechanism.[¶](#section-2.6.1.4-2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.6.1.4-2.3}

The Neighbor Cache is highly dynamic, as mappings are added when a new
IPv6 address appears on the network. This could be quite frequently with
[privacy extension addresses](#RFC8981){.xref}
\[[RFC8981](#RFC8981){.xref}\] or when they are removed when the state
goes from UNREACH to removed (the default time for a removal per
[Neighbor Unreachability Detection](#RFC4861){.xref}
\[[RFC4861](#RFC4861){.xref}\] algorithm is 38 seconds for a host using
Windows 7). This means that the content of the Neighbor Cache must be
fetched periodically at an interval that does not exhaust the router
resources and still provides valuable information (the suggested value
is 30 seconds, but this should be verified in the actual deployment) and
stored for later use.[¶](#section-2.6.1.4-3){.pilcrow}

This is an important source of information because it is trivial (on a
switch not using the [SAVI](#RFC7039){.xref}
\[[RFC7039](#RFC7039){.xref}\] algorithm) to defeat the mapping between
data-link layer address and an IPv6 address. Put another way, having
access to the current and past content of the Neighbor Cache has a
paramount value for the forensic and audit trails. It should also be
noted that, in certain threat models, this information is also deemed
valuable and could itself be a target.[¶](#section-2.6.1.4-4){.pilcrow}

When using one /64 per host ([Section 2.1.8](#sixty4perhost){.xref}) or
DHCP-PD, it is sufficient to keep the history of the allocated prefixes
when combined with strict source address prefix enforcement on the

In some networks, IPv6 addresses/prefixes are managed by a stateful
[DHCPv6 server](#RFC8415){.xref} \[[RFC8415](#RFC8415){.xref}\] that
leases IPv6 addresses/prefixes to clients. It is indeed quite similar to
DHCP for IPv4, so it can be tempting to use this DHCP lease file to
discover the mapping between IPv6 addresses/prefixes and data-link layer
addresses, as is commonly used in IPv4
networking.[¶](#section-2.6.1.5-1){.pilcrow}

It is not so easy in the IPv6 networks, because not all nodes will use
DHCPv6 (there are nodes that can only do stateless autoconfiguration)
and also because DHCPv6 clients are identified not by their
hardware-client address, as in IPv4, but by a DHCP Unique Identifier
(DUID). The DUID can have several formats: the data-link layer address,
the data-link layer address prepended with time information, or even an
opaque number that requires correlation with another data source to be
usable for operational security. Moreover, when the DUID is based on the
data-link address, this address can be of any client interface (such as
the wireless interface, while the client actually uses its wired
interface to connect to the network).[¶](#section-2.6.1.5-2){.pilcrow}

If a [lightweight DHCP relay agent](#RFC6221){.xref}
\[[RFC6221](#RFC6221){.xref}\] is used in a L2 switch, then the DHCP
servers also receive the interface ID information, which could be saved
in order to identify the interface on which the switch received a
specific leased IPv6 address. Also, if a \'normal\' (not lightweight)
relay agent adds the data-link layer address in the option for Relay
Agent Remote-ID \[[RFC4649](#RFC4649){.xref}\]
\[[RFC6939](#RFC6939){.xref}\], then the DHCPv6 server can keep track of
the data-link and leased IPv6
addresses.[¶](#section-2.6.1.5-3){.pilcrow}

In short, the DHCPv6 lease file is less interesting than lease files for
IPv4 networks. If possible, it is recommended to use DHCPv6 servers that
keep the relayed data-link layer address in addition to the DUID in the
lease file, as those servers have the equivalent information to IPv4
DHCP servers.[¶](#section-2.6.1.5-4){.pilcrow}

The mapping between the data-link layer address and the IPv6 address can
be secured by deploying switches implementing the
[SAVI](#RFC7513){.xref} \[[RFC7513](#RFC7513){.xref}\] mechanisms. Of
course, this also requires that the data-link layer address be protected
by using a L2 mechanism, such as

The forensic use case is when the network operator must locate an IPv6
address (and the associated port, access point/switch, or VPN tunnel)
that was present in the network at a certain time or is currently in the
network.[¶](#section-2.6.2.1-1){.pilcrow}

To locate an IPv6 address in an enterprise network where the operator
has control over all resources, the source of information can be the
Neighbor Cache, or, if not found, the DHCP lease file. Then, the
procedure is:[¶](#section-2.6.2.1-2){.pilcrow}

1.  [based on the IPv6 prefix of the IPv6 address; find one or more
    routers that are used to reach this prefix (assuming that
    anti-spoofing mechanisms are used), perhaps based on an
    IPAM.[¶](#section-2.6.2.1-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.6.2.1-3.1}
2.  [based on this limited set of routers, on the incident time, and on
    the IPv6 address; retrieve the data-link address from the live
    Neighbor Cache, from the historical Neighbor Cache data, or from
    SAVI events, or retrieve the data-link address from the DHCP lease
    file ([Section
    2.6.1.5](#stateful_dhcp){.xref}).[¶](#section-2.6.2.1-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.6.2.1-3.2}
3.  [based on the data-link layer address; look up the switch interface
    associated with the data-link layer address. In the case of wireless
    LAN with RADIUS accounting (see [Section
    2.6.1.6](#radius_accounting){.xref}), the RADIUS log has the mapping
    between the user identification and the MAC address. If a
    Configuration Management Database (CMDB) is used, then it can be
    used to map the data-link layer address to a switch
    port.[¶](#section-2.6.2.1-3.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.6.2.1-3.3}

At the end of the process, the interface of the host originating or the
subscriber identity associated with the activity in question has been
determined.[¶](#section-2.6.2.1-4){.pilcrow}

To identify the subscriber of an IPv6 address in a residential Internet
Service Provider, the starting point is the DHCP-PD leased prefix
covering the IPv6 address; this prefix can often be linked to a
subscriber via the RADIUS log. Alternatively, the Forwarding Information
Base (FIB) of the Cable Modem Termination System (CMTS) or Broadband
Network Gateway (BNG) indicates the Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) of
the subscriber and the RADIUS log can be used to retrieve the actual
subscriber.[¶](#section-2.6.2.1-5){.pilcrow}

More generally, a mix of the above techniques can be used in most, if
not all, networks.[¶](#section-2.6.2.1-6){.pilcrow}

##### [2.6.2.2.](#section-2.6.2.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Inventory](#name-inventory){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-inventory}

\[[RFC7707](#RFC7707){.xref}\] describes the difficulties for an
attacker to scan an IPv6 network due to the vast number of IPv6
addresses per link (and why in some cases it can still be done). While
the huge addressing space can sometimes be perceived as a
\'protection\', it also makes the inventory task difficult in an IPv6
network while it was trivial to do in an IPv4 network (a simple
enumeration of all IPv4 addresses, followed by a ping and a TCP/UDP port
scan). Getting an inventory of all connected devices is of prime
importance for a secure network
operation.[¶](#section-2.6.2.2-1){.pilcrow}

There are many ways to do an inventory of an IPv6
network.[¶](#section-2.6.2.2-2){.pilcrow}

The first technique is to use passive inspection, such as IPFIX. Using
exported IPFIX information and extracting the list of all IPv6 source
addresses allows finding all IPv6 nodes that sent packets through a
router. This is very efficient but, alas, will not discover silent nodes
that never transmitted packets traversing the IPFIX target router. Also,
it must be noted that link-local addresses will never be discovered by
this means.[¶](#section-2.6.2.2-3){.pilcrow}

The second way is again to use the collected Neighbor Cache content to
find all IPv6 addresses in the cache. This process will also discover
all link-local addresses. See [Section
2.6.1.4](#ndp_cache){.xref}.[¶](#section-2.6.2.2-4){.pilcrow}

Another way that works only for a local network consists of sending an
ICMP ECHO_REQUEST to the link-local multicast address ff02::1, which
addresses all IPv6 nodes on the network. All nodes should reply to this
ECHO_REQUEST, per
\[[RFC4443](#RFC4443){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2.6.2.2-5){.pilcrow}

Other techniques involve obtaining data from DNS, parsing log files, and
leveraging service discovery, such as mDNS
\[[RFC6762](#RFC6762){.xref}\]
\[[RFC6763](#RFC6763){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2.6.2.2-6){.pilcrow}

Enumerating DNS zones, especially looking at reverse DNS records and
CNAMEs, is another common method employed by various tools. As already
mentioned in \[[RFC7707](#RFC7707){.xref}\], this allows an attacker to
prune the IPv6 reverse DNS tree and hence enumerate it in a feasible
time. Furthermore, authoritative servers that allow zone transfers
(i.e., Authoritative Transfers (AXFRs)) may be a further information
source. An interesting research paper has analyzed the entropy in
various IPv6 addresses: see

In an IPv4 network, it is easy to correlate multiple logs, for example,
to find events related to a specific IPv4 address. A simple Unix grep
command is enough to scan through multiple text-based files and extract
all lines relevant to a specific IPv4
address.[¶](#section-2.6.2.3-1){.pilcrow}

In an IPv6 network, this is slightly more difficult because different
character strings can express the same IPv6 address. Therefore, the
simple Unix grep command cannot be used. Moreover, an IPv6 node can have
multiple IPv6 addresses.[¶](#section-2.6.2.3-2){.pilcrow}

In order to do correlation in IPv6-related logs, it is advised to have
all logs in a format with only canonical IPv6 addresses
\[[RFC5952](#RFC5952){.xref}\]. Then, the current (or historical)
Neighbor Cache data set must be searched to find the data-link layer
address of the IPv6 address. Next, the current and historical Neighbor
Cache data sets must be searched for all IPv6 addresses associated with
this data-link layer address to derive the search set. The last step is
to search in all log files (containing only IPv6 addresses in canonical

As it is expected that some networks will not run in a pure IPv6-only
mode, the different transition mechanisms must be deployed and operated
in a secure way. This section proposes operational guidelines for the
most-known and deployed transition techniques.

#### [2.7.1.](#section-2.7.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Dual Stack](#name-dual-stack){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-dual-stack}

Dual stack is often the first deployment choice for network operators.
Dual stacking the network offers some advantages over other transition
mechanisms. Firstly, the impact on existing IPv4 operations is reduced.
Secondly, in the absence of tunnels or address translation, the IPv4 and
IPv6 traffic are native (easier to observe and secure) and should have
the same network processing (network path, quality of service, etc.).
Dual stack enables a gradual termination of the IPv4 operations when the
IPv6 network is ready for prime time. On the other hand, the operators
have to manage two network stacks with the added
complexities.[¶](#section-2.7.1-1){.pilcrow}

From an operational security perspective, this now means that the
network operator has twice the exposure. One needs to think about
protecting both protocols now. At a minimum, the IPv6 portion of a
dual-stacked network should be consistent with IPv4 from a security
policy point of view. Typically, the following methods are employed to
protect IPv4 networks at the edge or security
perimeter:[¶](#section-2.7.1-2){.pilcrow}

-   [ACLs to permit or deny
    traffic,[¶](#section-2.7.1-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.7.1-3.1}
-   [firewalls with stateful packet inspection,
    and[¶](#section-2.7.1-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.7.1-3.2}
-   [application firewalls inspecting the application
    flows.[¶](#section-2.7.1-3.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.7.1-3.3}

It is recommended that these ACLs and/or firewalls be additionally
configured to protect IPv6 communications. The enforced IPv6 security
must be congruent with the IPv4 security policy; otherwise, the attacker
will use the protocol version that has the more relaxed security policy.
Maintaining the congruence between security policies can be challenging
(especially over time); it is recommended to use a firewall or an ACL
manager that is dual stack, i.e., a system that can apply a single ACL
entry to a mixed group of IPv4 and IPv6
addresses.[¶](#section-2.7.1-4){.pilcrow}

Application firewalls work at the application layer and are oblivious to
the IP version, i.e., they work as well for IPv6 as for IPv4 and the
same application security policy will work for both protocol
versions.[¶](#section-2.7.1-5){.pilcrow}

Also, given the end-to-end connectivity that IPv6 provides, it is
recommended that hosts be fortified against threats. General device
hardening guidelines are provided in [Section
2.8](#device){.xref}.[¶](#section-2.7.1-6){.pilcrow}

For many years, all host operating systems have IPv6 enabled by default,
so it is possible even in an \'IPv4-only\' network to attack L2-adjacent
victims via their IPv6 link-local address or via a global IPv6 address
when the attacker provides rogue RAs or a rogue DHCPv6
service.[¶](#section-2.7.1-7){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC7123](#RFC7123){.xref}\] discusses the security implications of
native IPv6 support and IPv6 transition/coexistence technologies on

There are many tunnels used for specific use cases. Except when

of security issues, as described in
\[[RFC6169](#RFC6169){.xref}\]:[¶](#section-2.7.2-1){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

tunnel injection:
:   A malevolent actor knowing a few pieces of information (for example,
    the tunnel endpoints and the encapsulation protocol) can forge a
    packet that looks like a legitimate and valid encapsulated packet
    that will gladly be accepted by the destination tunnel endpoint.
    This is a specific case of
    spoofing.[¶](#section-2.7.2-2.2){.pilcrow}
:   

traffic interception:
:   No confidentiality is provided by the tunnel protocols (without the
    use of IPsec or alternative encryption methods); therefore, anybody
    on the tunnel path can intercept the traffic and have access to the
    cleartext IPv6 packet. Combined with the absence of authentication,
    an on-path attack can also be
    mounted.[¶](#section-2.7.2-2.4){.pilcrow}

    tunnel relay for free (this is a specific case of tunnel
    injection).[¶](#section-2.7.2-2.6){.pilcrow}
:   

reflection attack:
:   Another specific use case of tunnel injection where the attacker
    injects packets with an IPv4 destination address not matching the
    IPv6 address causing the first tunnel endpoint to re-encapsulate the
    packet to the destination. Hence, the final IPv4 destination will
    not see the original IPv4 address but only the IPv4 address of the
    relay router.[¶](#section-2.7.2-2.8){.pilcrow}

bypassing security policy:

    of the tunnel, then it may neither inspect nor detect malevolent
    IPv6 traffic transmitted over the
    tunnel.[¶](#section-2.7.2-2.10){.pilcrow}

To mitigate the bypassing of security policies, it is often recommended
to block all automatic tunnels in default OS configuration (if they are
not required) by denying IPv4 packets

should also be applied on all tunnel endpoints, if applicable, to

The reflection attack cited above should also be prevented by using an
IPv6 ACL preventing the hair pinning of the
traffic.[¶](#section-2.7.2-6){.pilcrow}

As several of the tunnel techniques share the same encapsulation (i.e.,
IPv4 protocol 41) and embed the IPv4 address in the IPv6 address, there
are a set of well-known looping attacks described in
\[[RFC6324](#RFC6324){.xref}\]. This RFC also proposes mitigation

of [IPsec](#RFC4301){.xref} \[[RFC4301](#RFC4301){.xref}\] in transport

ISATAP tunnels \[[RFC5214](#RFC5214){.xref}\] are mainly used within a

is no more often used, its security issues are relevant, per
\[[KRISTOFF](#KRISTOFF){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2.7.2.2-1){.pilcrow}

router does stateful operations in order to map all internal IPv4
addresses and Layer 4 ports to the IPv4 address and the set of Layer 4
ports received through the MAP configuration process. The SP equipment
always does stateless operations (either decapsulation or stateless

Teredo tunnels \[[RFC4380](#RFC4380){.xref}\] are mainly used in a

device thanks to its UDP encapsulation. Teredo tunnels connect a single

The biggest threat to Teredo is probably for an IPv4-only network, as
Teredo has been designed to easily traverse IPv4 NAT-PT devices, which
are quite often co-located with a stateful firewall. Therefore, if the
stateful IPv4 firewall allows unrestricted UDP outbound and accepts the
return UDP traffic, then Teredo actually punches a hole in this firewall
for all IPv6 traffic to and from the Internet. Host policies can be
deployed to block Teredo in an IPv4-only network in order to avoid this
firewall bypass. On the IPv4 firewall, all outbound UDPs should be
blocked except for the commonly used services (e.g., port 53 for DNS,
port 123 for NTP, port 443 for QUIC, port 500 for Internet Key Exchange
Protocol (IKE), port 3478 for Session Traversal Utilities for NAT

provider translation from IPv6 to IPv4, i.e., giving IPv4-only
application access to an IPv4-only server over an IPv6-only network.
464XLAT shares the same security considerations as NAT64 and DNS64;
however, it can be used without DNS64, avoiding the DNSSEC
implications.[¶](#section-2.7.3.2-3){.pilcrow}

Dual-Stack Lite (DS-Lite) \[[RFC6333](#RFC6333){.xref}\] is a transition
technique that enables a service provider to share IPv4 addresses among
customers by combining two well-known technologies: IP in IP
(IPv4-in-IPv6) and IPv4 NAPT.[¶](#section-2.7.3.3-1){.pilcrow}

Security considerations, with respect to DS-Lite, mainly revolve around
logging data, preventing DoS attacks from rogue devices (as the Address
Family Translation Router (AFTR) \[[RFC6333](#RFC6333){.xref}\] function
is stateful), and restricting service offered by the AFTR only to
registered customers.[¶](#section-2.7.3.3-2){.pilcrow}

## [3.](#section-3){.section-number .selfRef} [Enterprises-Specific Security Considerations](#name-enterprises-specific-securi){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-enterprises-specific-securi}

Enterprises \[[RFC7381](#RFC7381){.xref}\] generally have robust network
security policies in place to protect existing IPv4 networks. These
policies have been distilled from years of experiential knowledge of
securing IPv4 networks. At the very least, it is recommended that
enterprise networks have parity between their security policies for both
protocol versions. This section also applies to the enterprise part of
all SP networks, i.e., the part of the network where the SP employees
are connected.[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

Security considerations in the enterprise can be broadly categorized
into two groups: external and internal.[¶](#section-3-2){.pilcrow}

::: {#external}
::: {#section-3.1 .section}
### [3.1.](#section-3.1){.section-number .selfRef} [External Security Considerations](#name-external-security-considera){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-external-security-considera}

The external aspect deals with providing security at the edge or
perimeter of the enterprise network where it meets the service
provider\'s network. This is commonly achieved by enforcing a security
policy, either by implementing dedicated firewalls with stateful packet
inspection or a router with ACLs. A common default IPv4 policy on
firewalls that could easily be ported to IPv6 is to allow all traffic
outbound while only allowing specific traffic, such as established
sessions, inbound (see \[[RFC6092](#RFC6092){.xref}\]). [Section
3.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7381#section-3.2){.relref} of
\[[RFC7381](#RFC7381){.xref}\] also provides similar
recommendations.[¶](#section-3.1-1){.pilcrow}

Here are a few more things that could enhance the default
policy:[¶](#section-3.1-2){.pilcrow}

-   [Filter internal-use IPv6 addresses at the perimeter; this will also
    mitigate the vulnerabilities listed in
    \[[RFC7359](#RFC7359){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3.1-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.1-3.1}
-   [Discard packets from and to bogon and reserved space; see
    \[[CYMRU](#CYMRU){.xref}\] and
    \[[RFC8190](#RFC8190){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3.1-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.1-3.2}
-   [Accept certain ICMPv6 messages to allow proper operation of ND and
    Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD); see \[[RFC4890](#RFC4890){.xref}\] or
    \[[REY_PF](#REY_PF){.xref}\] for
    hosts.[¶](#section-3.1-3.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.1-3.3}
-   [Based on the use of the network, filter specific extension headers
    by accepting only the required ones (permit list approach), such as
    ESP, AH, and not forgetting the required transport layers: ICMP,
    TCP, UDP, etc. This filtering should be done where applicable at the
    edge and possibly inside the perimeter; see
    \[[IPV6-EH-FILTERING](#I-D.ietf-opsec-ipv6-eh-filtering){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3.1-3.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.1-3.4}
-   [Filter packets having an illegal IPv6 header chain at the perimeter
    (and, if possible, inside the network as well); see [Section
    2.2](#ext_headers){.xref}.[¶](#section-3.1-3.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.1-3.5}
-   [Filter unneeded services at the
    perimeter.[¶](#section-3.1-3.6){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.1-3.6}
-   [Implement ingress and egress anti-spoofing in the forwarding and
    control planes; see \[[RFC2827](#RFC2827){.xref}\] and
    \[[RFC3704](#RFC3704){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3.1-3.7){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.1-3.7}
-   [Implement appropriate rate-limiters and control plane policers
    based on traffic
    baselines.[¶](#section-3.1-3.8){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.1-3.8}

Having global IPv6 addresses on all the enterprise sites is different
than in IPv4, where \[[RFC1918](#RFC1918){.xref}\] addresses are often
used internally and not routed over the Internet.
\[[RFC7359](#RFC7359){.xref}\] and \[[WEBER_VPN](#WEBER_VPN){.xref}\]
explain that without careful design, there could be IPv6 leakages from
Layer 3 VPNs.[¶](#section-3.1-4){.pilcrow}
:::

::: {#internal}
::: {#section-3.2 .section}
### [3.2.](#section-3.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Internal Security Considerations](#name-internal-security-considera){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-internal-security-considera}

The internal aspect deals with providing security inside the perimeter
of the network, including end hosts. Internal networks of enterprises
are often different, e.g., University campus, wireless guest access,
etc., so there is no \"one size fits all\"
recommendation.[¶](#section-3.2-1){.pilcrow}

The most significant concerns here are related to Neighbor Discovery. At
the network level, it is recommended that all security considerations
discussed in [Section 2.3](#linklayer){.xref} be reviewed carefully and
the recommendations be considered in-depth as well. [Section
4.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7381#section-4.1){.relref} of
\[[RFC7381](#RFC7381){.xref}\] also provides some
recommendations.[¶](#section-3.2-2){.pilcrow}

As mentioned in [Section 2.7.2](#transition){.xref}, care must be taken
when running automated IPv6-in-IPv4
tunnels.[¶](#section-3.2-3){.pilcrow}

When site-to-site VPNs are used, it should be kept in mind that, given
the global scope of IPv6 global addresses as opposed to the common use
of IPv4 private address space \[[RFC1918](#RFC1918){.xref}\], sites
might be able to communicate with each other over the Internet even when
the VPN mechanism is not available. Hence, no traffic encryption is
performed and traffic could be injected from the Internet into the site;
see \[[WEBER_VPN](#WEBER_VPN){.xref}\]. It is recommended to filter at
Internet connection(s) packets having a source or destination address
belonging to the site internal prefix or prefixes; this should be done
for ingress and egress traffic.[¶](#section-3.2-4){.pilcrow}

Hosts need to be hardened directly through security policy to protect
against security threats. The host firewall default capabilities have to
be clearly understood. In some cases, third-party firewalls have no IPv6
support, whereas the native firewall installed by default has IPv6
support. General device hardening guidelines are provided in [Section
2.8](#device){.xref}.[¶](#section-3.2-5){.pilcrow}

It should also be noted that many hosts still use IPv4 for transporting
logs for RADIUS, DIAMETER, TACACS+, syslog, etc. Operators cannot rely
on an IPv6-only security policy to secure such protocols that are still
using IPv4.[¶](#section-3.2-6){.pilcrow}

The threats and mitigation techniques are identical between IPv4 and
IPv6. Broadly speaking, they are:[¶](#section-4.1-1){.pilcrow}

-   [authenticating the TCP
    session;[¶](#section-4.1-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.1-2.1}

### [4.3.](#section-4.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Lawful Intercept](#name-lawful-intercept){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-lawful-intercept}

The lawful intercept requirements are similar for IPv6 and IPv4
architectures and will be subject to the laws enforced in different
geographic regions. The local issues with each jurisdiction can make
this challenging and both corporate legal and privacy personnel should
be involved in discussions pertaining to what information gets logged
and with regard to the respective log retention policies for this
information.[¶](#section-4.3-1){.pilcrow}

The target of interception will usually be a residential subscriber
(e.g., his/her PPP session, physical line, or CPE MAC address). In the
absence of IPv6 NAT on the CPE, IPv6 has the possibility to allow for
intercepting the traffic from a single host (i.e., a /128 target) rather
than the whole set of hosts of a subscriber (which could be a /48, /60,
or /64).[¶](#section-4.3-2){.pilcrow}

In contrast, in mobile environments, since the 3GPP specifications
allocate a /64 per device, it may be sufficient to intercept traffic
from the /64 rather than specific /128s (since each time the device
establishes a data connection, it gets a new
IID).[¶](#section-4.3-3){.pilcrow}

## [5.](#section-5){.section-number .selfRef} [Residential Users Security Considerations](#name-residential-users-security-){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-residential-users-security-}

The IETF Home Networking (homenet) Working Group is working on standards
and guidelines for IPv6 residential networks; this obviously includes
operational security considerations, but this is still a work in
progress. \[[RFC8520](#RFC8520){.xref}\] is an interesting approach on
how firewalls could retrieve and apply specific security policies to
some residential devices.[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

Some residential users have less experience and knowledge about security
or networking than experimented operators. As most of the recent hosts
(e.g., smartphones and tablets) have IPv6 enabled by default, IPv6
security is important for those users. Even with an IPv4-only ISP, those
users can get IPv6 Internet access with the help of
[Teredo](#teredo){.xref} ([Section 2.7.2.8](#teredo){.xref}) tunnels.
Several peer-to-peer programs support IPv6, and those programs can
initiate a Teredo tunnel through an IPv4 residential gateway, with the
consequence of making the internal host reachable from any IPv6 host on
the Internet. Therefore, it is recommended that all host security
products (including personal firewalls) are configured with a dual-stack
security policy.[¶](#section-5-2){.pilcrow}

If the residential CPE has IPv6 connectivity,
\[[RFC7084](#RFC7084){.xref}\] defines the requirements of an IPv6 CPE
and does not take a position on the debate of default IPv6 security
policy, as defined in
\[[RFC6092](#RFC6092){.xref}\]:[¶](#section-5-3){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

outbound only:
:   Allowing all internally initiated connections and blocking all
    externally initiated ones, which is a common default security policy
    enforced by IPv4 residential gateway doing NAPT, but it also breaks
    the end-to-end reachability promise of IPv6.
    \[[RFC6092](#RFC6092){.xref}\] lists several recommendations to
    design such a CPE.[¶](#section-5-4.2){.pilcrow}
:   

open/transparent:
:   Allowing all internally and externally initiated connections,
    therefore, restoring the end-to-end nature of the Internet for IPv6
