Many modern mail clients display small extracts of the body text as an
aid to allow a user to quickly decide whether they are interested in
viewing the full message contents. Mail clients implementing the
[Internet Message Access Protocol](#RFC3501){.xref}
\[[RFC3501](#RFC3501){.xref}\] would benefit from a standardized,
consistent way to generate these brief textual previews of
messages.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

Generation of a preview on the server has several benefits. First, it
allows consistent representation of previews across all clients. While
different clients might generate quite different preview text, having
common preview text generated by the server can give a more consistent
user experience to those who use multiple
clients.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

Second, server-side preview generation is more efficient. A client-based
algorithm needs to issue, at a minimum, a FETCH BODYSTRUCTURE command in
order to determine which [MIME](#RFC2045){.xref}
\[[RFC2045](#RFC2045){.xref}\] body part(s) should be represented in the
preview. Subsequently, at least one FETCH BODY command may be needed to
retrieve body data used in preview generation. These FETCH commands
cannot be pipelined since the BODYSTRUCTURE query must be parsed on the
client before the list of parts to be retrieved via the BODY command(s)
can be determined.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

Additionally, it may be difficult to predict the amount of body data
that must be retrieved to adequately represent the part via a preview,
therefore requiring inefficient fetching of excessive data in order to
account for this uncertainty. For example, a preview algorithm to
display data contained in a [text/html](#RFC2854){.xref}
\[[RFC2854](#RFC2854){.xref}\] part will likely strip the markup tags to
obtain textual content. However, without fetching the entire content of
the part, there is no way to guarantee that sufficient non-tag content
will exist unless either 1) the entire part is retrieved or 2) an
additional partial FETCH is executed when the client determines that it
does not possess sufficient data from a previous partial FETCH to
display an adequate representation of the
preview.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

Finally, server generation allows caching in a centralized location.
Using server-generated previews allows global generation once per
message, and that preview can be cached for the retention period of the
source message. Retrieval of message data may be expensive within a
server, for example, so a server can be configured to reduce its storage
retrieval load by pre-generating preview
data.[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}

A server indicates support for this extension via the \"PREVIEW\"
capability name.[¶](#section-1-6){.pilcrow}

The server returns a variable-length string that is the generated
preview for that message. This string is intended to be viewed by the
user as a contextual preview of the entire message and is not intended
to be interpreted in any way by the client
software.[¶](#section-3.2-1){.pilcrow}

Example: Retrieving preview information in a SELECTed
mailbox.[¶](#section-3.2-2){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-3.2-3}
``` sourcecode
  C: A1 FETCH 1 (PREVIEW)
  S: * 1 FETCH (PREVIEW "Preview text!")
  S: A1 OK FETCH complete.
```

[¶](#section-3.2-3){.pilcrow}
:::

A server [SHOULD]{.bcp14} strive to generate the same string for a given
message for each request. However, since previews are understood to be
an approximation of the message data and not a canonical view of its
contents, a client [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} assume that a message preview is
immutable for a given message. This relaxed requirement permits a server
to offer previews as an option without requiring potentially burdensome
storage and/or processing requirements to guarantee immutability for a
use case that does not require this strictness. For example, the
underlying IMAP server may change due to a system software upgrade; an
account\'s state information may be retained in the migration, but the
new server may generate different preview text than the old
server.[¶](#section-3.2-4){.pilcrow}

It is possible that the server has determined that no meaningful preview
text can be generated for a particular message. Examples of this involve
encrypted messages, content types the server does not support previews
of, and other situations where the server is not able to extract
information for a preview. In such cases, the server [MUST]{.bcp14}
return a zero-length string. Clients [SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} send another
FETCH for a preview for such messages. (As discussed previously, preview
data is not immutable, so there is chance that at some point in the
future the server would be able to generate meaningful text. However,
this scenario is expected to be rare, so a client should not continually
send out requests to try to detect this infrequent
occurrence.)[¶](#section-3.2-5){.pilcrow}

If the [LAZY modifier](#LAZY){.xref} ([Section 4.1](#LAZY){.xref}) is
used, the server [MAY]{.bcp14} return NIL for the preview response,
indicating that preview generation could not be completed without
causing undue delay. A server [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} return NIL to a FETCH
PREVIEW request made without the LAZY
modifier.[¶](#section-3.2-6){.pilcrow}
:::

::: {#section-3.3 .section}
### [3.3.](#section-3.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Preview Text Format](#name-preview-text-format){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-preview-text-format}

The generated preview text [MUST]{.bcp14} be treated as
[text/plain](#RFC2046){.xref} \[[RFC2046](#RFC2046){.xref}\] media type
data by the client.[¶](#section-3.3-1){.pilcrow}

The generated string [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be content transfer encoded and
[MUST]{.bcp14} be encoded in [UTF-8](#RFC3629){.xref}
\[[RFC3629](#RFC3629){.xref}\]. The server [SHOULD]{.bcp14} remove any
formatting markup and do whatever processing might be useful in
rendering the preview as plain text.[¶](#section-3.3-2){.pilcrow}

For purposes of this section, a \"preview character\" is defined as a
single Universal Character Set (UCS) character encoded in UTF-8. Note: a
single preview character may comprise multiple octets, so any buffers
implemented to conform to the string limitations identified in this
document should be sized to prevent possible overflow
errors.[¶](#section-3.3-3){.pilcrow}

The server [SHOULD]{.bcp14} limit the length of the preview text to 200
preview characters. This length should provide sufficient data to
generally support both various languages (and their different average
word lengths) and diverse client display size
requirements.[¶](#section-3.3-4){.pilcrow}

The server [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} output preview text longer than 256
preview characters.[¶](#section-3.3-5){.pilcrow}

If the preview is not generated based on the body content of the
message, and the [LANGUAGE extension](#RFC5255){.xref}
\[[RFC5255](#RFC5255){.xref}\] is supported by the server, the preview
text [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be generated according to the language rules that
apply to human-readable text. For example, a message that consists of a
single image MIME part has no human-readable text from which to generate
preview information. Instead, the server may wish to output a
description that the message contains an image and describe some
attributes of the image, such as image format, size, and filename. This
descriptive text is not a product of the message body itself but is
rather auto-generated data by the server; it should thus use the rules
defined for human-readable text described in the LANGUAGE extension (if
supported on the server).[¶](#section-3.3-6){.pilcrow}

### [4.1.](#section-4.1){.section-number .selfRef} [LAZY](#name-lazy){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-lazy}

The LAZY modifier directs the server to return the preview
representation only if that data can be returned without undue delay to
the client.[¶](#section-4.1-1){.pilcrow}

If this modifier is used, and the server is unable to return preview
data without undue delay, the server [MUST]{.bcp14} return NIL as the
preview response.[¶](#section-4.1-2){.pilcrow}

The LAZY modifier [MUST]{.bcp14} be implemented by any server that
supports the PREVIEW extension.[¶](#section-4.1-3){.pilcrow}

### [4.2.](#section-4.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Client Implementation Advice](#name-client-implementation-advic){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-client-implementation-advic}

Upon opening a mailbox, a client generally performs a FETCH of message
details in order to create a listing to present to the user (e.g.,
ENVELOPE data). Using this extension, a client may want to additionally
display preview information as part of this listing. Quickly providing
the base mailbox listing with basic message details is the primary goal
of this command as this is required to allow the user to begin
interacting with the mailbox. Preview data is likely to be of secondary
importance; it provides useful context, but it is not necessary to
perform message actions. A client can load unavailable previews in the
background and display them asynchronously to the user as the preview
data is provided by the server.[¶](#section-4.2-1){.pilcrow}

In this scenario, the client would add the PREVIEW data item, with the
LAZY modifier, to the list of FETCH items needed to generate the mailbox
listing. This allows the server to advantageously return preview data
without blocking the primary goal of quickly returning the basic message
details used to generate the mailbox
listing.[¶](#section-4.2-2){.pilcrow}

Once this initial FETCH is complete, the client can then issue FETCH
requests, without the LAZY modifier, to load the PREVIEW data item for
the messages in which preview data was not returned. It is
[RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14} that these FETCH requests be issued in small
batches, e.g., 50 messages per FETCH command, since preview generation
may be expensive and a single large request may exceed server resource
limits.[¶](#section-4.2-3){.pilcrow}

See Example 2 in [Section 5](#Examples){.xref} for an implementation of
this strategy.[¶](#section-4.2-4){.pilcrow}

A client [SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} continually issue FETCH PREVIEW requests
with the LAZY modifier in a selected mailbox as the server is under no
requirement to return preview information for this command, which could
lead to an unnecessary waste of system and network
resources.[¶](#section-4.2-5){.pilcrow}

## [8.](#section-8){.section-number .selfRef} [Security Considerations](#name-security-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-security-considerations}

Implementation of this extension might enable denial-of-service attacks
against server resources, due to excessive memory or CPU usage during
preview generation or increased storage usage if preview results are
stored on the server after generation. In order to mitigate such
attacks, servers [SHOULD]{.bcp14} log the client authentication identity
on FETCH PREVIEW operations in order to facilitate tracking of abusive
clients.[¶](#section-8-1){.pilcrow}

Servers [MAY]{.bcp14} limit the resources that preview generation uses.
Such resource limitations might, in an extreme example, cause a server
to return a preview that is the empty string for a message that
otherwise would have had a non-empty preview. However, it is recommended
that at least some preview text be provided in this situation, even if
the quality of the preview is degraded.[¶](#section-8-2){.pilcrow}

Just as the messages they summarize, preview data may contain sensitive
information. If generated preview data is stored on the server, e.g.,
for caching purposes, these previews [MUST]{.bcp14} be protected with
equivalent authorization and confidentiality controls as the source
message.[¶](#section-8-3){.pilcrow}
