# Information-Centric Networking (ICN): Content-Centric Networking (CCNx) and Named Data Networking (NDN) Terminology {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

Information-Centric Networking (ICN) is a novel paradigm where network
communications are accomplished by requesting named content instead of
sending packets to destination addresses. Named Data Networking (NDN)
and Content-Centric Networking (CCNx) are two prominent ICN
architectures. This document provides an overview of the terminology and
definitions that have been used in describing concepts in these two
implementations of ICN. While there are other ICN architectures, they
are not part of the NDN and CCNx concepts and as such are out of scope
for this document. This document is a product of the Information-Centric
Networking Research Group (ICNRG).[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

Information-centric networking (ICN) is an architecture to evolve the
Internet infrastructure from the existing host-centric design to a
data-centric architecture, where accessing data by name becomes the
essential network primitive. The goal is to let applications refer to
data independently of their location or means of transportation, which
enables native multicast delivery, ubiquitous in-network caching, and
replication of data objects.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

As the work on this topic continues to evolve, many new terms are
emerging. The goal of this document is to collect the key terms with a
corresponding definition as they are used in the CCNx and NDN projects.
Among the important documents for these projects are
\[[RFC8569](#RFC8569){.xref}\], \[[RFC8609](#RFC8609){.xref}\], and
\[[NDNTLV](#NDNTLV){.xref}\]. Other ICN projects such as
\[[NETINF](#NETINF){.xref}\], \[[PSIRP](#PSIRP){.xref}\], or
\[[MOBILITY-FIRST](#MOBILITY-FIRST){.xref}\] are not covered and may be
the subject of other documents.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

In this document, to help provide context for the individual defined
terms, we first sketch the bigger picture of an ICN network by
introducing the basic concepts and identifying the major components of
the architecture in [Section
2](#a-sketch-of-the-big-picture-of-icn){.xref}; after which, in [Section
3](#terms-by-category){.xref}, ICN-related terms are listed by different
categories. Readers should be aware that in this organization, some
terms may be used in other definitions before they themselves are
defined.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

While this terminology document describes both confidentiality and
integrity-related terms, it should be noted that ICN architectures like
NDN and CCNx generally do not provide data confidentiality, which is
treated in these architectures as an application-layer
concern.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

This document represents the consensus of the Information-Centric
Networking Research Group (ICNRG). It has been reviewed extensively by
the Research Group (RG) members active in the specific areas of work
covered by the document. It is not an IETF product and is not intended
for standardization in the IETF.[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}

[Figure 1](#figure-1){.selfRef}: [Request-Reply Protocol of ICN
Networking.](#name-request-reply-protocol-of-i){.selfRef}
:::

The following list describes the basic ICN concepts needed to discuss
the implementation of this service
abstraction.[¶](#section-2-3){.pilcrow}

**Request-Reply Protocol (Interest and Data
Packet):**[¶](#section-2-4){.pilcrow}

-   [An ICN\'s lookup service is implemented by defining two types of
    network packet formats: [Interest packets](#interest_packet){.xref}
    that request content by name and [Data packets](#data_packet){.xref}
    that carry the requested content. The returned Data packet must
    match the request\'s parameters (e.g., having a partially or fully
    matching name). If the request is ambiguous and several Data packets
    would satisfy the request, the ICN network returns only one matching
    Data packet (thus achieving flow balance between Interest and Data
    packets over individual Layer 2
    interfaces).[¶](#section-2-5.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-2-5.1}

**Packet and Content Names:**[¶](#section-2-6){.pilcrow}

-   [Without a strong cryptographic binding between the name of a [Data
    packet](#data_packet){.xref} and its content, Data packet names
    would be useless for fetching specific content. In ICN, verification
    of a Data packet\'s name-to-content binding is achieved through
    cryptographic means either by (1) a cryptographic signature that
    explicitly binds an application-chosen name to a Data packet\'s
    content or by (2) relying on an implicit name (cryptographic hash of
    the Data packet with or without application-chosen name) that the
    data consumer obtained through other
    means.[¶](#section-2-7.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-2-7.1}

**Data Authenticity and Encryption:**[¶](#section-2-8){.pilcrow}

-   [Any data consumer or network element can (in principle) validate
    the authenticity of a [Data packet](#data_packet){.xref} by
    verifying its cryptographic name-to-content binding. Note that data
    authenticity is distinct from data trustworthiness, though the two
    concepts are related. A packet is authentic if it has a valid
    name-to-content binding, but it may still be unwise to \"trust\" the
    content for any particular
    purpose.[¶](#section-2-9.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-2-9.1}

**Trust:**[¶](#section-2-10){.pilcrow}

-   [Data authenticity is distinct from data trustworthiness, though the
    two concepts are related. A packet is authentic if it has a valid
    name-to-content binding. A packet is trustworthy, i.e., it comes
    from a reputable or trusted origin, if this binding is valid in the
    context of a trust model. The trust model provides assurance that
    the name used for a given piece of content is appropriate for the
    value of the content. [Section 6](#security-considerations){.xref}
    discusses this
    further.[¶](#section-2-11.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-2-11.1}

**Segmenting and Versioning:**[¶](#section-2-12){.pilcrow}

-   [An ICN network will be engineered for some packet size limit. As
    application-level data objects will often be considerably larger,
    objects must be segmented into multiple [Data
    packets](#data_packet){.xref}. The names for these Data packets can,
    for example, be constructed by choosing one application-level object
    name to which a different suffix is added for each segment. The same
    method can be used to handle different versions of an
    application-level object by including a version number in the name
    of the overall
    object.[¶](#section-2-13.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-2-13.1}

**Packet and Frame:**[¶](#section-2-14){.pilcrow}

-   [NDN and CCNx introduce Protocol Data Units (PDUs), which typically
    are larger than the maximum transmission unit of the underlying
    networking technology. We refer to PDUs as packets and the
    (potentially fragmented) packet parts that traverse MTU-bound Layer
    2 interfaces as frames. Handling Layer 2 technologies that lead to
    fragmentation of ICN packets is done inside the ICN network and is
    not visible at the service
    interface.[¶](#section-2-15.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-2-15.1}

**ICN Node:**[¶](#section-2-16){.pilcrow}

-   [A node within an ICN network can fulfill the role of a data
    producer, a data consumer, and/or a forwarder for
    [Interest](#interest_packet){.xref} and [Data
    packets](#data_packet){.xref}. When a forwarder has connectivity to
    neighbor nodes, it performs Interest and Data packet forwarding in
    real time. It can also behave as a store and forward node carrying
    an Interest or Data packet for some time before forwarding it to the
    next node. An ICN node may also run routing protocols to assist its
    Interest forwarding
    decisions.[¶](#section-2-17.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-2-17.1}

**Forwarding Plane:**[¶](#section-2-18){.pilcrow}

-   [The canonical way of implementing packet forwarding in an ICN
    network relies on three data structures that capture a node\'s
    state: a Forwarding Interest Base (FIB), a Pending Interest Table
    (PIT), and a [Content Store](#content_store){.xref} (CS). It also
    utilizes Interest forwarding strategies, which take input from both
    FIB and measurements to make Interest forwarding decisions. When a
    node receives an [Interest packet](#interest_packet){.xref}, it
    checks its CS and PIT to find a matching entry; if no match is
    found, the node records the Interest in its PIT and forwards the
    Interest to the next hop(s) towards the requested content, based on
    the information in its
    FIB.[¶](#section-2-19.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-2-19.1}

**Information-Centric Networking (ICN):**[¶](#section-3.1-1){.pilcrow}

-   [A networking architecture that retrieves [Data
    packets](#data_packet){.xref} in response to [Interest
    packets](#interest_packet){.xref}. Content-Centric Networking (CCNx
    1.x) and Named Data Networking (NDN) are two realizations (designs)
    of an ICN
    architecture.[¶](#section-3.1-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.1-2.1}

**Data Packet Immutability:**[¶](#section-3.1-3){.pilcrow}

-   [After a [Data packet](#data_packet){.xref} is created, the
    cryptographic signature binding the name to the content ensures that
    if either the content or the name changes, that change will be
    detected and the packet discarded. If the content carried in a Data
    packet is intended to be mutable, versioning of the name should be
    used so that each version uniquely identifies an immutable instance
    of the content. This allows disambiguation of various versions of
    content such that coordination among the various instances in a
    distributed system can be
    achieved.[¶](#section-3.1-4.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.1-4.1}

    physical network interface (ethernet, Wi-Fi, bluetooth adapter,

## [4.](#section-4){.section-number .selfRef} [Semantics and Usage](#name-semantics-and-usage){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-semantics-and-usage}

The terminology described above is the manifestation of intended
semantics of NDN and CCNx operations (What do we expect the network to
do?). In this section, we summarize the most commonly proposed use cases
and interpretations.[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-4.1 .section}
### [4.1.](#section-4.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Data Transfer](#name-data-transfer){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-data-transfer}

The networking view of NDN and CCNx is that the request/reply protocol
implements a basic, unreliable data transfer service for single, named
packets.[¶](#section-4.1-1){.pilcrow}

::: {#data-transport}
::: {#section-4.2 .section}
### [4.2.](#section-4.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Data Transport](#name-data-transport){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-data-transport}

Data transfer can be turned into a data transport service for
application-level objects by additional logic. This transport logic must
understand and construct the series of names needed to reassemble the
segmented object. Various flavors of transport can be envisaged
(reliable, streaming, mailbox, etc.).[¶](#section-4.2-1){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-4.3 .section}
### [4.3.](#section-4.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Lookup Service](#name-lookup-service){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-lookup-service}

In a more distributed systems view of the basic request/reply protocol,
NDN and CCNx provide a distributed lookup service: given a key value
(=name), the service will return the corresponding
value.[¶](#section-4.3-1){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-4.4 .section}
### [4.4.](#section-4.4){.section-number .selfRef} [Database Access](#name-database-access){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-database-access}

A lookup service can be turned into a database access protocol by using
the namespace structure to specify names as access keys into a database.
Therefore, a name prefix stands for a collection or table of a database,
while the rest of the name specifies the query expression to be
executed.[¶](#section-4.4-1){.pilcrow}

The names as defined in this document for Interests and Data can refer
to Remote Procedure call functions, their input arguments, and their
results. For a comprehensive view of how to construct RPC or other
remote invocation systems, see the Association for Computing Machinery
(ACM) ICN paper on \[[RICE](#RICE){.xref}\]. These capabilities can be
further extended into a full distributed computing infrastructure such
as that proposed in the ACM ICN paper
\[[CFN](#CFN){.xref}\].[¶](#section-4.5-1){.pilcrow}

The names as defined in this document for Interests and Data can refer
to data collections to be subscribed and individual data objects to be
published in a Publish-Subscribe application architecture. For a fully
worked example of how to construct such an ICN-based system, see the ACM
ICN paper

## [6.](#section-6){.section-number .selfRef} [Security Considerations](#name-security-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-security-considerations}

While the terms defined in this specification do not in and of
themselves present new security considerations, the architectures that
utilize the terms most certainly do. Readers should look at those
specifications (e.g., \[[RFC8569](#RFC8569){.xref}\] and
\[[NDN](#NDN){.xref}\]) where various security considerations are
addressed in detail.[¶](#section-6-1){.pilcrow}

Some of the terms in this document use the words \"trust\",
\"trustworthy\", or \"trust model\". We intend that these have their
colloquial meanings; however, much work on trust, and specifically on
trust schemas for ICN architectures, has been published in the last few
years. For example, it is useful to look at
\[[SCHEMATIZING-TRUST](#SCHEMATIZING-TRUST){.xref}\] for more
information on the approaches taken to formalize notions of trust for
current NDN and CCNx systems.[¶](#section-6-2){.pilcrow}
