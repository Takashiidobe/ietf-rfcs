The core of the Homenet protocol suite consists of the Home Networking
Control Protocol (HNCP) \[[RFC7788](#RFC7788){.xref}\], a protocol used
for flooding configuration information and assigning prefixes to links,
combined with the Babel routing protocol \[[RFC8966](#RFC8966){.xref}\].
Babel is an extensible, flexible, and modular protocol: minimal
implementations of Babel have been demonstrated that consist of a few
hundred lines of code, while the \"large\" implementation includes
support for a number of extensions and consists of over ten thousand
lines of C code.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

This document consists of two parts. The first specifies the exact
subset of the Babel protocol and its extensions that is required by an
implementation of the Homenet protocol suite. The second specifies how
HNCP interacts with Babel.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

The Babel routing protocol and its extensions are defined in a number of
documents:[¶](#section-1.2-1){.pilcrow}

-   [RFC 8966 \[[RFC8966](#RFC8966){.xref}\] defines the Babel routing
    protocol. It allows Babel\'s control data to be carried either over
    link-local IPv6 or over IPv4 and in either case allows announcing
    both IPv4 and IPv6 routes. It leaves link cost estimation, metric
    computation, and route selection to the implementation. Distinct
    implementations of Babel \[[RFC8966](#RFC8966){.xref}\] will
    interoperate, in the sense that they will maintain a set of
    loop-free forwarding paths. However, if they implement conflicting
    options, they might not be able to exchange a full set of routes. In
    the worst case, an implementation that only implements the IPv6
    subset of the protocol and an implementation that only implements
    the IPv4 subset of the protocol will not exchange any routes. In
    addition, if implementations use conflicting route selection
    policies, persistent oscillations might
    occur.[¶](#section-1.2-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-1.2-2.1}
-   [The informative [Appendix
    A](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8966#appendix-A){.relref} of
    \[[RFC8966](#RFC8966){.xref}\] suggests a simple and
    easy-to-implement algorithm for cost and metric computation that has
    been found to work satisfactorily in a wide range of
    topologies.[¶](#section-1.2-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-1.2-2.2}
-   [While RFC 8966 does not provide an algorithm for route selection,
    its Section
    [3.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8966#section-3.6){.relref}
    suggests selecting the route with the smallest metric with some
    hysteresis applied. An algorithm that has been found to work well in
    practice is described in Section III.E of
    \[[DELAY-BASED](#DELAY-BASED){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1.2-2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-1.2-2.3}
-   [Four documents define optional extensions to Babel: authentication
    based on Hashed Message Authentication Code (HMAC)
    \[[RFC8967](#RFC8967){.xref}\], source-specific routing
    \[[RFC9079](#RFC9079){.xref}\], delay-based routing
    \[[BABEL-RTT](#I-D.ietf-babel-rtt-extension){.xref}\], and
    ToS-specific (Type of Service) routing
    \[[ToS-SPECIFIC](#I-D.chouasne-babel-tos-specific){.xref}\]. All of
    these extensions interoperate with the core protocol as well as with
    each other.[¶](#section-1.2-2.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-1.2-2.4}

REQ1:

:   ::: {#req1}
    A Homenet implementation of Babel [MUST]{.bcp14} encapsulate Babel
    control traffic in IPv6 packets sent to the IANA-assigned port 6696
    and either the IANA-assigned multicast group ff02::1:6 or to a
    link-local unicast address.[¶](#section-2.1-1.1.1){.pilcrow}

    Rationale: Since Babel is able to carry both IPv4 and IPv6 routes
    over either IPv4 or IPv6, choosing the protocol used for carrying
    control traffic is a matter of preference. Since IPv6 has some
    features that make implementations somewhat simpler and more
    reliable (notably properly scoped and reasonably stable link-local
    addresses), we require carrying control data over
    IPv6.[¶](#section-2.1-1.1.2){.pilcrow}

    A Homenet implementation of Babel [MUST]{.bcp14} implement the IPv6
    subset of the protocol defined in the body of
    RFC 8966.[¶](#section-2.1-1.2.1){.pilcrow}

    Rationale: Support for IPv6 routing is an essential component of the
    Homenet architecture.[¶](#section-2.1-1.2.2){.pilcrow}
    :::

REQ3:

:   ::: {#req3}
    A Homenet implementation of Babel [SHOULD]{.bcp14} implement the
    IPv4 subset of the protocol defined in the body of RFC 8966. Use of
    other techniques for acquiring IPv4 connectivity (such as multiple
    layers of NAT) is strongly
    discouraged.[¶](#section-2.1-1.3.1){.pilcrow}

    Rationale: Support for IPv4 will likely remain necessary for years
    to come, and even in pure IPv6 deployments, including code for
    supporting IPv4 has very little cost. Since HNCP makes it easy to
    assign distinct IPv4 prefixes to the links in a network, it is not
    necessary to resort to multiple layers of NAT, with all of its
    problems.[¶](#section-2.1-1.3.2){.pilcrow}
    :::

:   

REQ4:

:   ::: {#req4}
    A Homenet implementation of Babel [MUST]{.bcp14} implement
    source-specific routing for IPv6, as defined in RFC 9079
    \[[RFC9079](#RFC9079){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2.1-1.4.1){.pilcrow}

    Rationale: Source-specific routing is an essential component of the
    Homenet architecture. Source-specific routing for IPv4 is not
    required, since HNCP arranges things so that a single nonspecific
    IPv4 default route is announced ([Section
    6.5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7788#section-6.5){.relref} of
    \[[RFC7788](#RFC7788){.xref}\]).[¶](#section-2.1-1.4.2){.pilcrow}
    :::

:   

REQ5:

:   ::: {#req5}
    A Homenet implementation of Babel must use metrics that are of a
    similar magnitude to the values suggested in [Appendix
    A](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8966#appendix-A){.relref} of
    \[[RFC8966](#RFC8966){.xref}\]. In particular, it [SHOULD]{.bcp14}
    assign costs that are no less than 256 to wireless links and
    [SHOULD]{.bcp14} assign costs between 32 and 196 to lossless wired
    links.[¶](#section-2.1-1.5.1){.pilcrow}

    Rationale: If two implementations of Babel choose very different
    values for link costs, combining routers from different vendors will
    cause suboptimal routing.[¶](#section-2.1-1.5.2){.pilcrow}
    :::

:   

REQ6:

:   ::: {#req6}
    A Homenet implementation of Babel [SHOULD]{.bcp14} distinguish
    between wired and wireless links; if it is unable to determine
    whether a link is wired or wireless, it [SHOULD]{.bcp14} make the
    worst-case hypothesis that the link is wireless. It [SHOULD]{.bcp14}
    dynamically probe the quality of wireless links and derive a
    suitable metric from its quality estimation. [Appendix
    A](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8966#appendix-A){.relref} of
    \[[RFC8966](#RFC8966){.xref}\] gives an example of a suitable
    algorithm.[¶](#section-2.1-1.6.1){.pilcrow}

    Rationale: Support for wireless transit links is a distinguishing
    feature of Homenet, and one that is requested by our users. In the
    absence of dynamically computed metrics, the routing protocol
    attempts to minimise the number of links crossed by a route and
    therefore prefers long, lossy links to shorter, lossless ones. In
    wireless networks, \"hop-count routing is worst-path
    routing\".[¶](#section-2.1-1.6.2){.pilcrow}

    While it would be desirable to perform link-quality probing on some
    wired link technologies, notably power-line networks, these kinds of
    links tend to be difficult or impossible to detect automatically,
    and we are not aware of any published link-quality algorithms for
    them. Hence, we do not require link-quality estimation for wired
    links of any kind.[¶](#section-2.1-1.6.3){.pilcrow}

OPT1:

:   ::: {#opt1}
    A Homenet implementation of Babel [MAY]{.bcp14} perform route
    selection by applying hysteresis to route metrics, as suggested in
    [Section
    3.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8966#section-3.6){.relref} of
    \[[RFC8966](#RFC8966){.xref}\] and described in detail in
    Section III.E of \[[DELAY-BASED](#DELAY-BASED){.xref}\]. However,
    hysteresis is not required, and the implementation may simply pick
    the route with the smallest metric.[¶](#section-2.2-1.1.1){.pilcrow}

    Rationale: Hysteresis is only useful in congested and highly dynamic
    networks. In a typical home network, which is stable and
    uncongested, the feedback loop that hysteresis compensates for does
    not occur.[¶](#section-2.2-1.1.2){.pilcrow}
    :::

:   

OPT2:

:   ::: {#opt2}
    A Homenet implementation of Babel may include support for other
    extensions to the protocol, as long as they are known to
    interoperate with both the core protocol and source-specific
    routing.[¶](#section-2.2-1.2.1){.pilcrow}

    Rationale: A number of extensions to the Babel routing protocol have
    been defined over the years; however, they are useful in fairly
    specific situations, such as routing over global-scale overlay
    networks \[[BABEL-RTT](#I-D.ietf-babel-rtt-extension){.xref}\] or
    multi-hop wireless networks with multiple radio frequencies
    \[[BABEL-Z](#I-D.chroboczek-babel-diversity-routing){.xref}\].
    Hence, with the exception of source-specific routing, no extensions
    are required for Homenet.[¶](#section-2.2-1.2.2){.pilcrow}

## [3.](#section-3){.section-number .selfRef} [Interactions between HNCP and Babel](#name-interactions-between-hncp-a){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-interactions-between-hncp-a}

The Homenet architecture cleanly separates configuration, which is done
by HNCP, from routing, which is done by Babel. While the coupling
between the two protocols is deliberately kept to a minimum, some
interactions are unavoidable.[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

All the interactions between HNCP and Babel consist of HNCP causing
Babel to perform an announcement on its behalf (under no circumstances
does Babel cause HNCP to perform an action). How this is realised is an
implementation detail that is outside the scope of this document; while
it could conceivably be done using a private communication channel
between HNCP and Babel, in existing implementations, HNCP installs a
route in the operating system\'s kernel that is later picked up by Babel
using the existing redistribution mechanisms.[¶](#section-3-2){.pilcrow}

REQ7:

:   ::: {#req7}
    If an HNCP node receives a DHCPv6 prefix delegation for prefix P and
    publishes an External-Connection TLV containing a Delegated-Prefix
    TLV with prefix P and no Prefix-Policy TLV, then it [MUST]{.bcp14}
    announce a source-specific default route with source prefix P over
    Babel.[¶](#section-3.1-1.1.1){.pilcrow}

    Rationale: Source-specific routes are the main tool that Homenet
    uses to enable optimal routing in the presence of multiple IPv6
    prefixes. External connections with nontrivial prefix policies are
    explicitly excluded from this requirement, since their exact
    behaviour is application specific.[¶](#section-3.1-1.1.2){.pilcrow}

    route over Babel.[¶](#section-3.1-1.2.1){.pilcrow}

    Rationale: The Homenet stack does not use source-specific routing
    for IPv4; instead, HNCP elects a single NAT gateway and publishes a
    single default route towards that gateway
    (\[[RFC7788](#RFC7788){.xref}\], [Section

    [REQ7](#req7){.xref}.[¶](#section-3.2-1.1.1){.pilcrow}

    Rationale: Since the source-specific default route is more specific
    than the nonspecific default route, the former will override the
    latter if all nodes implement source-specific routing. Announcing an
    additional nonspecific route is allowed, since doing that causes no
    harm and might simplify operations in some circumstances, e.g., when

    Rationale: Homenet does not require support for IPv4 source-specific
    routing. Announcing IPv4 source-specific routes will not cause
    routing pathologies (blackholes or routing loops), but it might
    cause packets sourced in different parts of the Homenet to follow
    different paths, with all the confusion that this

## [4.](#section-4){.section-number .selfRef} [Security Considerations](#name-security-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-security-considerations}

Both HNCP and Babel carry their control data in IPv6 packets with a
link-local source address, and implementations are required to drop
packets sent from a global address. Hence, they are only susceptible to
attacks from a directly connected link on which the HNCP and Babel
implementations are listening.[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

The security of a Homenet network relies on having a set of
\"Internal\", \"Ad Hoc\", and \"Hybrid\" interfaces ([Section
5.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7788#section-5.1){.relref} of
\[[RFC7788](#RFC7788){.xref}\]) that are assumed to be connected to
links that are secured at a lower layer. HNCP and Babel packets are only
accepted when they originate on these trusted links. \"External\" and
\"Guest\" interfaces are connected to links that are not trusted, and
any HNCP or Babel packets that are received on such interfaces are
ignored. (\"Leaf\" interfaces are a special case since they are
connected to trusted links, but HNCP and Babel traffic received on such
interfaces is ignored.) This implies that the security of a Homenet
network depends on the reliability of the border discovery procedure
described in [Section
5.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7788#section-5.3){.relref} of
\[[RFC7788](#RFC7788){.xref}\].[¶](#section-4-2){.pilcrow}

If untrusted links are used for transit, which is [NOT
RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14}, then any HNCP and Babel traffic that is carried
over such links [MUST]{.bcp14} be secured using an upper-layer security
protocol. While both HNCP and Babel support cryptographic
authentication, at the time of writing, no protocol for autonomous
configuration of HNCP and Babel security has been
defined.[¶](#section-4-3){.pilcrow}
