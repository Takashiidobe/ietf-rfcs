# RFC 8730 {#rfcnum}

# Independent Submission Editor Model {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

This document describes the function and responsibilities of the RFC
Independent Submission Editor (ISE). The Independent Submission stream
is one of the stream producers that create draft RFCs, with the ISE as
its stream approver. The ISE is overall responsible for activities
within the Independent Submission stream, working with draft editors and
reviewers, and interacts with the RFC Production Center and Publisher,
and the RFC Series Editor (RSE). The ISE is appointed by the IAB, and
also interacts with the IETF Administration Limited Liability Company
(LLC).[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

This version obsoletes RFC 6548 to replace all references to the
Internet Administrative Support Activity (IASA) and related structures
with those defined by the IASA 2.0
structure.[¶](#section-abstract-2){.pilcrow}

## [1.](#section-1){.section-number .selfRef} [Introduction](#name-introduction){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-introduction}

The RFC Editor Model \[[RFC8728](#RFC8728){.xref}\] defines a set of
streams that produce draft RFCs, which are submitted for publication.
This document defines the management function for the Independent
Submission stream, specifically the role of Independent Submission
Editor (ISE).[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

The previous version of this document \[[RFC6548](#RFC6548){.xref}\] is
a derivative of \[[RFC5620](#RFC5620){.xref}\], [Section
3.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5620#section-3.2){.relref}, and
was separated out from
\[[RFC6635](#RFC6635){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

This document updates the Independent Submission Editor Model to align
it with the IASA 2.0 structure \[[RFC8711](#RFC8711){.xref}\] that
creates the IETF Administration Limited Liability Company (\"LLC\")
managed by a board of directors (\"LLC Board\"). This document obsoletes
\[[RFC6548](#RFC6548){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}
:::

::: {#section-2 .section}
## [2.](#section-2){.section-number .selfRef} [Independent Submission Editor](#name-independent-submission-edit){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-independent-submission-edit}

The ISE is an individual who is responsible for the Independent
Submission stream of RFCs, as defined by \[[RFC8729](#RFC8729){.xref}\].
The Independent Submission stream and the ISE are not under the
authority or direction of the RSE or the RFC Series Oversight Committee
(RSOC) (see \[[RFC8728](#RFC8728){.xref}\]). As noted below, the ISE is
appointed by and is responsible directly to the
IAB.[¶](#section-2-1){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-2.1 .section}
### [2.1.](#section-2.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Qualifications](#name-qualifications){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-qualifications}

The ISE is a senior position for which the following qualifications are
desired:[¶](#section-2.1-1){.pilcrow}

1.  [Technical competence, i.e., broad technical experience and
    perspective across a wide range of Internet technologies and
    applications, and also the ability to work effectively with portions
    of that spectrum in which they have no personal
    expertise.[¶](#section-2.1-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.1-2.1}
2.  [Thorough familiarity with the RFC
    series.[¶](#section-2.1-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.1-2.2}
3.  [An ability to define and constitute advisory and document review
    arrangements. If those arrangements include an Editorial Board
    similar to the current one or some equivalent arrangement, the
    ability to assess the technical competence of potential Editorial
    Board members (see [Section
    3](#editorial_board){.xref}).[¶](#section-2.1-2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.1-2.3}
4.  [Good standing in the technical community, in and beyond the
    IETF.[¶](#section-2.1-2.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.1-2.4}
5.  [Demonstrated editorial skills, good command of the English
    language, and demonstrated history of being able to work effectively
    with technical documents and materials created by
    others.[¶](#section-2.1-2.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.1-2.5}
6.  [The ability to work effectively in a multi-actor environment with
    divided authority and responsibility similar to that described in
    \[[RFC6635](#RFC6635){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2.1-2.6){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.1-2.6}

::: {#section-2.2 .section}
### [2.2.](#section-2.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Responsibilities](#name-responsibilities){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-responsibilities}

The ISE is an individual who may have assistants and who is responsible
for:[¶](#section-2.2-1){.pilcrow}

1.  [Maintaining technical quality of the Independent Submission
    stream.[¶](#section-2.2-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.2-2.1}
2.  [Reviewing, approving, and processing Independent
    Submissions.[¶](#section-2.2-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.2-2.2}
3.  [Forwarding draft RFCs in the Independent Submission stream to the
    RFC Production
    Center.[¶](#section-2.2-2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.2-2.3}
4.  [Defining and developing the scope of the Independent Submission
    stream as a part of the overall RFC Editor function
    \[[RFC6635](#RFC6635){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2.2-2.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.2-2.4}
5.  [Reviewing and approving RFC errata for Independent
    Submissions.[¶](#section-2.2-2.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.2-2.5}
6.  [Coordinating work and conforming to general RFC Series policies as
    specified by the IAB and
    RSE.[¶](#section-2.2-2.6){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.2-2.6}
7.  [Providing statistics and documentation as requested by the RSE
    and/or LLC.[¶](#section-2.2-2.7){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.2-2.7}

The ISE may choose to select individuals to participate in an Advisory
Board for assistance in special topics as the ISE deems appropriate.
Such an Advisory Board exists at the pleasure of the ISE, and its
members serve at the pleasure of the ISE.[¶](#section-2.2-3){.pilcrow}

The individual with the listed qualifications is selected by the IAB
after input has been collected from the
community.[¶](#section-2.2-4){.pilcrow}

While the ISE itself is considered a volunteer function, the IAB
considers maintaining the Independent Submission stream part of the
IAB\'s supported activities. Therefore, the LLC should include these
costs in the IASA budget.[¶](#section-2.2-5){.pilcrow}

## [3.](#section-3){.section-number .selfRef} [Independent Submission Editorial Board](#name-independent-submission-edito){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-independent-submission-edito}

The ISE is supported by an Editorial Board for the review of Independent
Submission stream documents. This board is known as the Independent
Submission Editorial Board. This volunteer Editorial Board exists at the
pleasure of the ISE, and its members serve at the pleasure of the ISE.
The existence of this board is simply noted within this model, and
additional discussion of such is considered out of scope of this
document.[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}
