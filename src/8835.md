WebRTC is a protocol suite aimed at real-time multimedia exchange
between browsers, and between browsers and other
entities.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

WebRTC is described in the WebRTC overview document
\[[RFC8825](#RFC8825){.xref}\], which also defines terminology used in
this document, including the terms \"WebRTC endpoint\" and \"WebRTC
browser\".[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

Terminology for RTP sources is taken from
\[[RFC7656](#RFC7656){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

This document focuses on the data transport protocols that are used by
conforming implementations, including the protocols used for interaction
with intermediate boxes such as firewalls, relays, and NAT
boxes.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

This protocol suite is intended to satisfy the security considerations
described in the WebRTC security documents,
\[[RFC8826](#RFC8826){.xref}\] and
\[[RFC8827](#RFC8827){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}

This document describes requirements that apply to all WebRTC endpoints.
When there are requirements that apply only to WebRTC browsers, this is
called out explicitly.[¶](#section-1-6){.pilcrow}

The protocol specifications used here assume that the following
protocols are available to the implementations of the WebRTC
protocols:[¶](#section-3.1-1){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

UDP \[[RFC0768](#RFC0768){.xref}\]:
:   This is the protocol assumed by most protocol elements
    described.[¶](#section-3.1-2.2){.pilcrow}
:   

TCP \[[RFC0793](#RFC0793){.xref}\]:
:   This is used for HTTP/WebSockets, as well as TURN/TLS and
    ICE-TCP.[¶](#section-3.1-2.4){.pilcrow}
:   

For both protocols, IPv4 and IPv6 support is
assumed.[¶](#section-3.1-3){.pilcrow}

For UDP, this specification assumes the ability to set the
Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) of the sockets opened on a
per-packet basis, in order to achieve the prioritizations described in
\[[RFC8837](#RFC8837){.xref}\] (see [Section 4.2](#s-qos){.xref} of this
document) when multiple media types are multiplexed. It does not assume
that the DSCPs will be honored and does assume that they may be zeroed
or changed, since this is a local configuration
issue.[¶](#section-3.1-4){.pilcrow}

Platforms that do not give access to these interfaces will not be able
to support a conforming WebRTC endpoint.[¶](#section-3.1-5){.pilcrow}

This specification does not assume that the implementation will have
access to ICMP or raw IP.[¶](#section-3.1-6){.pilcrow}

The following protocols may be used, but they can be implemented by a
WebRTC endpoint and are therefore not defined as \"system-provided
interfaces\":[¶](#section-3.1-7){.pilcrow}

Web applications running in a WebRTC browser [MUST]{.bcp14} be able to
utilize both IPv4 and IPv6 where available \-- that is, when two peers
have only IPv4 connectivity to each other, or they have only IPv6
connectivity to each other, applications running in the WebRTC browser
[MUST]{.bcp14} be able to communicate.[¶](#section-3.2-1){.pilcrow}

When TURN is used, and the TURN server has IPv4 or IPv6 connectivity to
the peer or the peer\'s TURN server, candidates of the appropriate types
[MUST]{.bcp14} be supported. The \"Happy Eyeballs\" specification for
ICE \[[RFC8421](#RFC8421){.xref}\] [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be
supported.[¶](#section-3.2-2){.pilcrow}

### [3.3.](#section-3.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Usage of Temporary IPv6 Addresses](#name-usage-of-temporary-ipv6-add){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-usage-of-temporary-ipv6-add}

The IPv6 default address selection specification
\[[RFC6724](#RFC6724){.xref}\] specifies that temporary addresses
\[[RFC4941](#RFC4941){.xref}\] are to be preferred over permanent
addresses. This is a change from the rules specified by
\[[RFC3484](#RFC3484){.xref}\]. For applications that select a single
address, this is usually done by the IPV6_PREFER_SRC_TMP preference flag
specified in \[[RFC5014](#RFC5014){.xref}\]. However, this rule, which
is intended to ensure that privacy-enhanced addresses are used in
preference to static addresses, doesn\'t have the right effect in ICE,
where all addresses are gathered and therefore revealed to the
application. Therefore, the following rule is applied
instead:[¶](#section-3.3-1){.pilcrow}

When a WebRTC endpoint gathers all IPv6 addresses on its host, and both
nondeprecated temporary addresses and permanent addresses of the same
scope are present, the WebRTC endpoint [SHOULD]{.bcp14} discard the
permanent addresses before exposing addresses to the application or
using them in ICE. This is consistent with the default policy described
in \[[RFC6724](#RFC6724){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3.3-2){.pilcrow}

If some, but not all, of the temporary IPv6 addresses are marked
deprecated, the WebRTC endpoint [SHOULD]{.bcp14} discard the deprecated
addresses, unless they are used by an ongoing connection. In an ICE
restart, deprecated addresses that are currently in use [MAY]{.bcp14} be
retained.[¶](#section-3.3-3){.pilcrow}

### [3.4.](#section-3.4){.section-number .selfRef} [Middlebox-Related Functions](#name-middlebox-related-functions){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-middlebox-related-functions}

The primary mechanism for dealing with middleboxes is ICE, which is an
appropriate way to deal with NAT boxes and firewalls that accept traffic
from the inside, but only from the outside if it is in response to
inside traffic (simple stateful firewalls).[¶](#section-3.4-1){.pilcrow}

ICE \[[RFC8445](#RFC8445){.xref}\] [MUST]{.bcp14} be supported. The
implementation [MUST]{.bcp14} be a full ICE implementation, not
ICE-Lite. A full ICE implementation allows interworking with both ICE
and ICE-Lite implementations when they are deployed
appropriately.[¶](#section-3.4-2){.pilcrow}

In order to deal with situations where both parties are behind NATs of
the type that perform endpoint-dependent mapping (as defined in
\[[RFC5128](#RFC5128){.xref}\], [Section
2.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5128#section-2.4){.relref}), TURN
\[[RFC8656](#RFC8656){.xref}\] [MUST]{.bcp14} be
supported.[¶](#section-3.4-3){.pilcrow}

WebRTC browsers [MUST]{.bcp14} support configuration of STUN and TURN
servers, from both browser configuration and an
application.[¶](#section-3.4-4){.pilcrow}

Note that other work exists around STUN and TURN server discovery and
management, including \[[RFC8155](#RFC8155){.xref}\] for server
discovery, as well as
\[[RETURN](#I-D.ietf-rtcweb-return){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3.4-5){.pilcrow}

In order to deal with firewalls that block all UDP traffic, the mode of
TURN that uses TCP between the WebRTC endpoint and the TURN server
[MUST]{.bcp14} be supported, and the mode of TURN that uses TLS over TCP
between the WebRTC endpoint and the TURN server [MUST]{.bcp14} be
supported. See [Section
3.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8656#section-3.1){.relref} of
\[[RFC8656](#RFC8656){.xref}\], for
details.[¶](#section-3.4-6){.pilcrow}

In order to deal with situations where one party is on an IPv4 network
and the other party is on an IPv6 network, TURN extensions for IPv6
[MUST]{.bcp14} be supported.[¶](#section-3.4-7){.pilcrow}

TURN TCP candidates, where the connection from the WebRTC endpoint\'s
TURN server to the peer is a TCP connection,
\[[RFC6062](#RFC6062){.xref}\] [MAY]{.bcp14} be
supported.[¶](#section-3.4-8){.pilcrow}

However, such candidates are not seen as providing any significant
benefit, for the following reasons.[¶](#section-3.4-9){.pilcrow}

First, use of TURN TCP candidates would only be relevant in cases where
both peers are required to use TCP to establish a
connection.[¶](#section-3.4-10){.pilcrow}

Second, that use case is supported in a different way by both sides
establishing UDP relay candidates using TURN over TCP to connect to
their respective relay servers.[¶](#section-3.4-11){.pilcrow}

Third, using TCP between the WebRTC endpoint\'s TURN server and the peer
may result in more performance problems than using UDP, e.g., due to
head of line blocking.[¶](#section-3.4-12){.pilcrow}

ICE-TCP candidates \[[RFC6544](#RFC6544){.xref}\] [MUST]{.bcp14} be
supported; this may allow applications to communicate to peers with
public IP addresses across UDP-blocking firewalls without using a TURN
server.[¶](#section-3.4-13){.pilcrow}

If TCP connections are used, RTP framing according to
\[[RFC4571](#RFC4571){.xref}\] [MUST]{.bcp14} be used for all packets.
This includes the RTP packets, DTLS packets used to carry data channels,
and STUN connectivity check packets.[¶](#section-3.4-14){.pilcrow}

The ALTERNATE-SERVER mechanism specified in [Section
11](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5389#section-11){.relref} of
\[[RFC5389](#RFC5389){.xref}\] (300 Try Alternate) [MUST]{.bcp14} be
supported.[¶](#section-3.4-15){.pilcrow}

The WebRTC endpoint [MAY]{.bcp14} support accessing the Internet through
an HTTP proxy. If it does so, it [MUST]{.bcp14} include the \"ALPN\"
header as specified in \[[RFC7639](#RFC7639){.xref}\], and proxy
authentication as described in [Section
4.3.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7231#section-4.3.6){.relref} of
\[[RFC7231](#RFC7231){.xref}\] and \[[RFC7235](#RFC7235){.xref}\]
[MUST]{.bcp14} also be supported.[¶](#section-3.4-16){.pilcrow}

### [3.5.](#section-3.5){.section-number .selfRef} [Transport Protocols Implemented](#name-transport-protocols-impleme){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-transport-protocols-impleme}

For transport of media, secure RTP is used. The details of the RTP
profile used are described in \"Media Transport and Use of RTP in
WebRTC\" \[[RFC8834](#RFC8834){.xref}\], which mandates the use of a
circuit breaker \[[RFC8083](#RFC8083){.xref}\] and congestion control
(see \[[RFC8836](#RFC8836){.xref}\] for further
guidance).[¶](#section-3.5-1){.pilcrow}

Key exchange [MUST]{.bcp14} be done using DTLS-SRTP, as described in
\[[RFC8827](#RFC8827){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3.5-2){.pilcrow}

For data transport over the WebRTC data channel
\[[RFC8831](#RFC8831){.xref}\], WebRTC endpoints [MUST]{.bcp14} support
SCTP over DTLS over ICE. This encapsulation is specified in
\[[RFC8261](#RFC8261){.xref}\]. Negotiation of this transport in the
Session Description Protocol (SDP) is defined in
\[[RFC8841](#RFC8841){.xref}\]. The SCTP extension for I-DATA
\[[RFC8260](#RFC8260){.xref}\] [MUST]{.bcp14} be
supported.[¶](#section-3.5-3){.pilcrow}

The setup protocol for WebRTC data channels described in
\[[RFC8832](#RFC8832){.xref}\] [MUST]{.bcp14} be
supported.[¶](#section-3.5-4){.pilcrow}

Note: The interaction between DTLS-SRTP as defined in
\[[RFC5764](#RFC5764){.xref}\] and ICE as defined in
\[[RFC8445](#RFC8445){.xref}\] is described in [Section
6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8842#section-6){.relref} of
\[[RFC8842](#RFC8842){.xref}\]. The effect of this specification is that
all ICE candidate pairs associated with a single component are part of
the same DTLS association. Thus, there will only be one DTLS handshake,
even if there are multiple valid candidate
pairs.[¶](#section-3.5-5.1){.pilcrow}

WebRTC endpoints [MUST]{.bcp14} support multiplexing of DTLS and RTP
over the same port pair, as described in the DTLS-SRTP specification
\[[RFC5764](#RFC5764){.xref}\], [Section
5.1.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5764#section-5.1.2){.relref},
with clarifications in \[[RFC7983](#RFC7983){.xref}\]. All
application-layer protocol payloads over this DTLS connection are SCTP
packets.[¶](#section-3.5-6){.pilcrow}

Protocol identification [MUST]{.bcp14} be supplied as part of the DTLS
handshake, as specified in
\[[RFC8833](#RFC8833){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3.5-7){.pilcrow}

## [4.](#section-4){.section-number .selfRef} [Media Prioritization](#name-media-prioritization){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-media-prioritization}

In the WebRTC prioritization model, the application tells the WebRTC
endpoint about the priority of media and data that is controlled from
the API.[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

In this context, a \"flow\" is used for the units that are given a
specific priority through the WebRTC API.[¶](#section-4-2){.pilcrow}

For media, a \"media flow\", which can be an \"audio flow\" or a \"video
flow\", is what \[[RFC7656](#RFC7656){.xref}\] calls a \"media source\",
which results in a \"source RTP stream\" and one or more \"redundancy
RTP streams\". This specification does not describe prioritization
between the RTP streams that come from a single media
source.[¶](#section-4-3){.pilcrow}

All media flows in WebRTC are assumed to be interactive, as defined in
\[[RFC4594](#RFC4594){.xref}\]; there is no browser API support for
indicating whether media is interactive or
noninteractive.[¶](#section-4-4){.pilcrow}

A \"data flow\" is the outgoing data on a single WebRTC data
channel.[¶](#section-4-5){.pilcrow}

The priority associated with a media flow or data flow is classified as
\"very-low\", \"low\", \"medium\", or \"high\". There are only four
priority levels in the API.[¶](#section-4-6){.pilcrow}

The priority settings affect two pieces of behavior: packet send
sequence decisions and packet markings. Each is described in its own
section below.[¶](#section-4-7){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-4.1 .section}
### [4.1.](#section-4.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Local Prioritization](#name-local-prioritization){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-local-prioritization}

Local prioritization is applied at the local node, before the packet is
sent. This means that the prioritization has full access to the data
about the individual packets and can choose differing treatment based on
the stream a packet belongs to.[¶](#section-4.1-1){.pilcrow}

When a WebRTC endpoint has packets to send on multiple streams that are
congestion controlled under the same congestion control regime, the
WebRTC endpoint [SHOULD]{.bcp14} cause data to be emitted in such a way
that each stream at each level of priority is being given approximately
twice the transmission capacity (measured in payload bytes) of the level
below.[¶](#section-4.1-2){.pilcrow}

Thus, when congestion occurs, a high-priority flow will have the ability
to send 8 times as much data as a very-low-priority flow if both have
data to send. This prioritization is independent of the media type. The
details of which packet to send first are implementation
defined.[¶](#section-4.1-3){.pilcrow}

For example, if there is a high-priority audio flow sending 100-byte
packets and a low-priority video flow sending 1000-byte packets, and
outgoing capacity exists for sending \> 5000 payload bytes, it would be
appropriate to send 4000 bytes (40 packets) of audio and 1000 bytes (one
packet) of video as the result of a single pass of sending
decisions.[¶](#section-4.1-4){.pilcrow}

Conversely, if the audio flow is marked low priority and the video flow
is marked high priority, the scheduler may decide to send 2 video
packets (2000 bytes) and 5 audio packets (500 bytes) when outgoing
capacity exists for sending \> 2500 payload
bytes.[¶](#section-4.1-5){.pilcrow}

If there are two high-priority audio flows, each will be able to send
4000 bytes in the same period where a low-priority video flow is able to
send 1000 bytes.[¶](#section-4.1-6){.pilcrow}

Two example implementation strategies are:[¶](#section-4.1-7){.pilcrow}

-   [When the available bandwidth is known from the congestion control
    algorithm, configure each codec and each data channel with a target
    send rate that is appropriate to its share of the available
    bandwidth.[¶](#section-4.1-8.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.1-8.1}
-   [When congestion control indicates that a specified number of
    packets can be sent, send packets that are available to send using a
    weighted round-robin scheme across the
    connections.[¶](#section-4.1-8.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.1-8.2}

Any combination of these, or other schemes that have the same effect, is
valid, as long as the distribution of transmission capacity is
approximately correct.[¶](#section-4.1-9){.pilcrow}

For media, it is usually inappropriate to use deep queues for sending;
it is more useful to, for instance, skip intermediate frames that have
no dependencies on them in order to achieve a lower bitrate. For
reliable data, queues are useful.[¶](#section-4.1-10){.pilcrow}

Note that this specification doesn\'t dictate when disparate streams are
to be \"congestion controlled under the same congestion control
regime\". The issue of coupling congestion controllers is explored
further in \[[RFC8699](#RFC8699){.xref}\].[¶](#section-4.1-11){.pilcrow}

### [4.2.](#section-4.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Usage of Quality of Service \-- DSCP and Multiplexing](#name-usage-of-quality-of-service){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-usage-of-quality-of-service}

When the packet is sent, the network will make decisions about queueing
and/or discarding the packet that can affect the quality of the
communication. The sender can attempt to set the DSCP field of the
packet to influence these decisions.[¶](#section-4.2-1){.pilcrow}

Implementations [SHOULD]{.bcp14} attempt to set QoS on the packets sent,
according to the guidelines in \[[RFC8837](#RFC8837){.xref}\]. It is
appropriate to depart from this recommendation when running on platforms
where QoS marking is not implemented.[¶](#section-4.2-2){.pilcrow}

The implementation [MAY]{.bcp14} turn off use of DSCP markings if it
detects symptoms of unexpected behavior such as priority inversion or
blocking of packets with certain DSCP markings. Some examples of such
behaviors are described in \[[ANRW16](#ANRW16){.xref}\]. The detection
of these conditions is implementation
dependent.[¶](#section-4.2-3){.pilcrow}

A particularly hard problem is when one media transport uses multiple
DSCPs, where one may be blocked and another may be allowed. This is
allowed even within a single media flow for video in
\[[RFC8837](#RFC8837){.xref}\]. Implementations need to diagnose this
scenario; one possible implementation is to send initial ICE probes with
DSCP 0, and send ICE probes on all the DSCPs that are intended to be
used once a candidate pair has been selected. If one or more of the
DSCP-marked probes fail, the sender will switch the media type to using
DSCP 0. This can be carried out simultaneously with the initial media
traffic; on failure, the initial data may need to be resent. This switch
will, of course, invalidate any congestion information gathered up to
that point.[¶](#section-4.2-4){.pilcrow}

Failures can also start happening during the lifetime of the call; this
case is expected to be rarer and can be handled by the normal mechanisms
for transport failure, which may involve an ICE
restart.[¶](#section-4.2-5){.pilcrow}

Note that when a DSCP causes nondelivery, one has to switch the whole
media flow to DSCP 0, since all traffic for a single media flow needs to
be on the same queue for congestion control purposes. Other flows on the
same transport, using different DSCPs, don\'t need to
change.[¶](#section-4.2-6){.pilcrow}

All packets carrying data from the SCTP association supporting the data
channels [MUST]{.bcp14} use a single DSCP. The code point used
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} be that recommended by \[[RFC8837](#RFC8837){.xref}\]
for the highest-priority data channel carried. Note that this means that
all data packets, no matter what their relative priority is, will be
treated the same by the network.[¶](#section-4.2-7){.pilcrow}

All packets on one TCP connection, no matter what it carries,
[MUST]{.bcp14} use a single DSCP.[¶](#section-4.2-8){.pilcrow}

More advice on the use of DSCPs with RTP, as well as the relationship
between DSCP and congestion control, is given in
\[[RFC7657](#RFC7657){.xref}\].[¶](#section-4.2-9){.pilcrow}

There exist a number of schemes for achieving quality of service that do
not depend solely on DSCPs. Some of these schemes depend on classifying
the traffic into flows based on 5-tuple (source address, source port,
protocol, destination address, destination port) or 6-tuple (5-tuple +
DSCP). Under differing conditions, it may therefore make sense for a
sending application to choose any of the following
configurations:[¶](#section-4.2-10){.pilcrow}

-   [Each media stream carried on its own
    5-tuple[¶](#section-4.2-11.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.2-11.1}
-   [Media streams grouped by media type into 5-tuples (such as carrying
    all audio on one
    5-tuple)[¶](#section-4.2-11.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.2-11.2}
-   [All media sent over a single 5-tuple, with or without
    differentiation into 6-tuples based on
    DSCPs[¶](#section-4.2-11.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.2-11.3}

In each of the configurations mentioned, data channels may be carried in
their own 5-tuple or multiplexed together with one of the media
flows.[¶](#section-4.2-12){.pilcrow}

More complex configurations, such as sending a high-priority video
stream on one 5-tuple and sending all other video streams multiplexed
together over another 5-tuple, can also be envisioned. More information
on mapping media flows to 5-tuples can be found in
\[[RFC8834](#RFC8834){.xref}\].[¶](#section-4.2-13){.pilcrow}

A sending implementation [MUST]{.bcp14} be able to support the following
configurations:[¶](#section-4.2-14){.pilcrow}

-   [Multiplex all media and data on a single 5-tuple (fully
    bundled)[¶](#section-4.2-15.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.2-15.1}
-   [Send each media stream on its own 5-tuple and data on its own
    5-tuple (fully
    unbundled)[¶](#section-4.2-15.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.2-15.2}

The sending implementation [MAY]{.bcp14} choose to support other
configurations, such as bundling each media type (audio, video, or data)
into its own 5-tuple (bundling by media
type).[¶](#section-4.2-16){.pilcrow}

Sending data channel data over multiple 5-tuples is not
supported.[¶](#section-4.2-17){.pilcrow}

A receiving implementation [MUST]{.bcp14} be able to receive media and
data in all these configurations.[¶](#section-4.2-18){.pilcrow}
