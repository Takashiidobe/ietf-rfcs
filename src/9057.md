# RFC 9057 {#rfcnum}

# Email Author Header Field {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

Internet mail defines the From: header field to indicate the author of
the message\'s content and the Sender: field to indicate who initially
handled the message on the author\'s behalf. The Sender: field is
optional if it has the same information as the From: field. This was not
a problem until development of stringent protections on use of the From:
field. It has prompted Mediators, such as mailing lists, to modify the
From: field to circumvent mail rejection caused by those protections. In
effect, the From: field has become dominated by its role as a handling
identifier.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

The current specification augments the altered use of the From: field by
specifying the Author: field, which ensures identification of the
original author of the message and is not subject to modification by
Mediators. This document is published as an Experimental RFC to assess
community interest, functional efficacy, and technical
adequacy.[¶](#section-abstract-2){.pilcrow}

## [1.](#section-1){.section-number .selfRef} [Introduction](#name-introduction){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-introduction}

Internet mail conducts asynchronous communication from an author to one
or more recipients and is used for ongoing dialog amongst them. Email
has a long history of serving a wide range of human uses and styles,
within that simple framework, and the mechanisms for making email robust
and safe serve that sole purpose.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

Internet mail defines the content header\'s From: field to indicate the
author of the message and the Sender: field to indicate who initially
handled the message on the author\'s behalf
\[[Mail-Fmt](#RFC5322){.xref}\]. The Sender: field is optional if it has
the same information as the From: field. That is, when the Sender: field
is absent, the From: field has conflated semantics as both a handling
identifier and a content creator identifier. These fields were initially
defined in \[[RFC733](#RFC0733){.xref}\], and making the redundant
Sender: field optional was a small, obvious optimization in the days of
slower communications, expensive storage, and less powerful
computers.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

The dual semantics were not a problem until development of stringent
protections on use of the From: field. It has prompted Mediators, such
as mailing lists, to modify the From: field to circumvent receiver mail
rejection caused by those protections. This affects end-to-end usability
of email between the author and the final recipients, because mail
received from the same author is treated differently by the recipient\'s
software, depending on what path the message
followed.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

By way of example, mail originating with:[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-1-5 .artwork .art-text .alignLeft}
    From:  Example User <user@example.com>

[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}
:::

which is sent directly to a recipient, will show the author\'s display
name correctly and can correctly analyze, filter, and aggregate mail
from the author based on their email address. However, if the author
sends through a mailing list and the mailing list conducts a common form
of From: modification needed to bypass enforcement of stringent
authentication policies, then the received message might instead have a
From: field showing:[¶](#section-1-6){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-1-7 .artwork .art-text .alignLeft}
    From: Example User via Example List <listname@list.example.org>

[¶](#section-1-7){.pilcrow}
:::

The change inserts an operational address, for the Mediator, into the
From: field and distorts the field\'s display name as a means of
recording the modification.[¶](#section-1-8){.pilcrow}

In terms of email identification semantics, this is a profound
change:[¶](#section-1-9){.pilcrow}

-   [The result is that the recipient\'s software will see the message
    as being from an entirely different author and will handle it
    separately, such as for sorting or filtering. In effect, the
    recipient\'s software will see the same person\'s email as being
    from a different address; this includes the person\'s actual address
    and each of the mailing lists that person\'s mail
    transits.[¶](#section-1-10.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-10.1}
-   [Mediators might create a Reply-To: field with the original From:
    field email address. This facilitates getting replies back to the
    original author, but it does nothing to aid other processing or
    presentation done by the recipient\'s Mail User Agent (MUA) based on
    what it believes is the author\'s address or original display name.
    This Reply-To action represents another knock-on effect (e.g.,
    collateral damage) by distorting the meaning of that header field,
    as well as creating an issue if the field already
    exists.[¶](#section-1-10.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-10.2}

In effect, the From: field has become dominated by its role as a
handling identifier. The current specification augments this altered use
of the From: field by specifying the Author: field, which identifies the
original author of the message and is not subject to modification by
Mediators.[¶](#section-1-11){.pilcrow}

While it might be cleanest to move towards more reliable use of the
Sender: field and then to target it as the focus of authentication
concerns, enhancement of existing standards works best with incremental
additions, rather than with efforts at replacement. To that end, this
specification provides a means of supplying author information that is
not subject to modification by processes seeking to enforce stringent
authentication.[¶](#section-1-12){.pilcrow}

This version is published as an Experimental RFC to assess community
interest, functional efficacy, and technical adequacy. See [Section
7](#experiment){.xref}.[¶](#section-1-13){.pilcrow}

## [3.](#section-3){.section-number .selfRef} [Author Header Field](#name-author-header-field){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-author-header-field}

Author: is a new message header field being defined. It has the same
syntax as the From: header field \[[Mail-Fmt](#RFC5322){.xref}\]. As
with the original and primary intent for the From: field, the Author:
field is intended to contain the email address of the author of the
message content. It also can contain the displayable human name of the
author.[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

The \[[ABNF](#RFC5234){.xref}\] for the field\'s syntax
is:[¶](#section-3-2){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-3-3}
``` {.sourcecode .lang-abnf}
author = "Author:" mailbox-list CRLF
```

[¶](#section-3-3){.pilcrow}
:::

which echos the syntax for the From: header
field.[¶](#section-3-4){.pilcrow}

This header field can be added as part of the original message creation
process, or it can be added later, by a Mediator, to preserve the
original author information from the From:
field.[¶](#section-3-5){.pilcrow}

The goal of the Author: field is to reflect information about the
original author. However, it is possible that the author\'s MUA or Mail
Submission Agent (MSA) will not create it but that a Mediator might know
it will be modifying the From: field and wish to preserve the author
information. Hence, it needs to be allowed to create the Author: field
for this if the field does not already exist.[¶](#section-3-6){.pilcrow}

Processing of the Author: field follows these
rules:[¶](#section-3-7){.pilcrow}

-   [If an Author: field already exists, a new one [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be
    created, and the existing one [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be
    modified.[¶](#section-3-8.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-8.1}
-   [An author\'s MUA or MSA [MAY]{.bcp14} create an Author: field, and
    its value [MUST]{.bcp14} be identical to the value in the From:
    field.[¶](#section-3-8.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-8.2}
-   [A Mediator [MAY]{.bcp14} create an Author: field if one does not
    already exist, and this new field\'s value [MUST]{.bcp14} be
    identical to the value of the From: field at the time the Mediator
    received the message (and before the Mediator causes any changes to
    the From: field).[¶](#section-3-8.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-8.3}
:::

::: {#section-4 .section}
## [4.](#section-4){.section-number .selfRef} [Discussion](#name-discussion){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-discussion}

The Author: header field, here, is intended for creation during message
generation or during mediation. It is intended for use by recipient
MUAs, as they typically use the From: field. In that regard, it would be
reasonable for an MUA that would normally organize, filter, or display
information based on the From: field to give the Author: header field
preference.[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

Original-From: is a similar header field referenced in
\[[RFC5703](#RFC5703){.xref}\]. It is registered with IANA, which cites
\[[RFC5703](#RFC5703){.xref}\] as the controlling source for the entry.
However, that document only has a minimal definition for the field.
Also, the field is solely intended for use by Mediators to preserve
information from a modified From: field. The current specification can
be used during either origination or
mediation.[¶](#section-4-2){.pilcrow}

While the basic model of email header fields is highly extensible, there
well might be implementation and usability considerations for carrying
this field through to end users, such as via
\[[IMAP](#RFC3501){.xref}\].[¶](#section-4-3){.pilcrow}

Obviously, any security-related processing of a message needs to
distinguish the From: field from the Author: field and treat their
information accordingly.[¶](#section-4-4){.pilcrow}
:::

::: {#section-5 .section}
## [5.](#section-5){.section-number .selfRef} [Security Considerations](#name-security-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-security-considerations}

Any header field containing identification information is a source of
security and privacy concerns, especially when the information pertains
to content authorship. Generally, the handling of the Author: header
field needs to receive scrutiny and care, comparable to that given to
the From: header field, but preferably not in a way that defeats its
utility.[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

Given the semantics of the Author: header field, it is easy to believe
that use of this field will create a new attack vector for tricking end
users. However (and perhaps surprisingly), for all of the real and
serious demonstrations of users being tricked by deceptive or false
content in a message, there is no evidence that problematic content in a
header field, which is providing information about message\'s author,
directly contributes to differential and problematic behavior by the end
user. (The presents an obvious exercise for the reader to find credible,
documented evidence.)[¶](#section-5-2){.pilcrow}

Given that the semantics of this field echo the long-standing From:
header field, the basic mechanics of the field\'s creation and use are
well understood. Points of concern, therefore, are with possible
interactions with the existing From: field, anti-abuse systems, and MUA
behavior, along with basic market acceptance. So the questions to answer
while the header field has experimental status
are:[¶](#section-7-1){.pilcrow}

-   [Is there demonstrated interest by MUA
    developers?[¶](#section-7-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-7-2.1}
-   [If MUA developers add this capability, is it used by
    authors?[¶](#section-7-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-7-2.2}
-   [Does the presence of the Author: field, in combination with the
    From: field, create any operational problems, especially for
    recipients?[¶](#section-7-2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-7-2.3}
-   [Does the presence of the Author: field demonstrate additional
    security issues?[¶](#section-7-2.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-7-2.4}
-   [Does the presence of the Author: field engender problematic
    behavior by anti-abuse software, such as defeating its
    utility?[¶](#section-7-2.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-7-2.5}
