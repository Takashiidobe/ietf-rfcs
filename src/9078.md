The popularity of social media has led to user comfort with easily
signaling summary reactions to an author\'s posting, by using emoji
graphics, such as with a \'thumbs up\', \'heart\', or \'smiley\'
indication. Sometimes the permitted repertoire is constrained to a small
set, and sometimes a more extensive range of indicators is
supported.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

This specification extends this existing practice in social media and
instant messaging into Internet Mail.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

While it is already possible to include symbols and graphics as part of
an email reply\'s content, there has not been an established means of
signaling the semantic substance that such data are to be taken as a
summary \'reaction\' to the original message \-- that is, a mechanism to
identify symbols as specifically providing a summary reaction to the
cited message rather than merely being part of the free text in the body
of a response. Such a structured use of the symbol(s) allows recipient
Mail User Agents (MUAs) to correlate this reaction to the original
message and possibly to display the information
distinctively.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

This facility defines a new MIME Content-Disposition, to be used in
conjunction with the In-Reply-To header field, to specify that a part of
a message containing one or more emojis can be treated as a summary
reaction to a previous message.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

part-content    = emoji *(WSP emoji) CRLF

emoji           = emoji-sequence

base-emojis     = thumbs-up / thumbs-down / grinning-face /
                  frowning-face / crying-face
                  ; Basic set of emojis, drawn from [Emoji-Seq]

; thumbs-up       = {U+1F44D}
; thumbs-down     = {U+1F44E}
; grinning-face   = {U+1F600}
; frowning-face   = {U+2639}
; crying-face     = {U+1F622}
```

[¶](#section-3-6){.pilcrow}
:::

The part-content is either the message\'s single MIME body or the
content portion of the first MIME multipart body
part.[¶](#section-3-7){.pilcrow}

The ABNF rule emoji-sequence is inherited from
\[[Emoji-Seq](#Emoji-Seq){.xref}\]. It defines a set of Unicode code
point sequences, which must then be encoded as UTF-8. Each sequence
forms a single pictograph. The BNF syntax used in
\[[Emoji-Seq](#Emoji-Seq){.xref}\] differs from
\[[ABNF](#RFC5234){.xref}\] and [MUST]{.bcp14} be interpreted as used in
Unicode documentation. The referenced document describes these as
sequences of code points.[¶](#section-3-8){.pilcrow}

Note: The part-content can first be parsed into candidate reactions,
separated by WSP. Each candidate reaction that does not constitute a
single emoji-sequence (as per \[[Emoji-Seq](#Emoji-Seq){.xref}\]) is
invalid. Invalid candidates can be treated individually, rather than
affecting the remainder of the part-content\'s processing. The remaining
candidates form the set of reactions to be processed. This approach
assumes use of a mechanism for emoji sequence validation that is not
specified here.[¶](#section-3-9.1){.pilcrow}

The rule base-emojis is provided as a simple, common list, or
\'vocabulary\' of emojis. It was developed from some existing practice
in social networking and is intended for similar use. However, support
for it as a base vocabulary is not required. Having providers and
consumers employ a common set will facilitate user interoperability, but
different sets of users might want to have different, common (shared)
sets.[¶](#section-3-10){.pilcrow}

The reaction emoji or emojis are linked to the current message\'s
In-Reply-To field, which references an earlier message and provides a
summary reaction to that earlier message
\[[Mail-Fmt](#RFC5322){.xref}\]. For processing details, see [Section
4](#processing){.xref}.[¶](#section-3-11){.pilcrow}

Reference to unallocated code points [SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} be treated as
an error; the corresponding UTF-8-encoded code points [SHOULD]{.bcp14}
be processed using the system default method for denoting an unallocated
or undisplayable code point.[¶](#section-3-12){.pilcrow}

Note: The \"emoji\" token looks simple. It isn\'t. Implementers are well
advised not to assume that emoji sequences are trivial to parse or
validate. Among other concerns, an implementation of the Unicode
Character Database is required. An emoji is more than a stand-in for a
simple alternation of characters. Similarly, one emoji sequence is not
interchangeable with, or equivalent to, another one, and comparisons
require detailed understanding of the relevant Unicode mechanisms. Use
of an existing Unicode implementation will typically prove extremely
helpful, as will an understanding of the error modes that may arise with
a chosen implementation.[¶](#section-3-13.1){.pilcrow}

::: {#processing}
::: {#section-4 .section}
## [4.](#section-4){.section-number .selfRef} [Reaction Message Processing](#name-reaction-message-processing){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-reaction-message-processing}

The presentation aspects of reaction processing are necessarily MUA
specific and beyond the scope of this specification. In terms of the
message itself, a recipient MUA that supports this mechanism operates as
follows:[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

1.  [If a received message R\'s header contains an In-Reply-To field,
    check to see if it references a previous message that the MUA has
    sent or received.[¶](#section-4-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-4-2.1}
2.  [If R\'s In-Reply-To: does reference one, then check R\'s message
    content for a part with a \"reaction\" Content-Disposition header
    field, at either the outermost level or as part of a multipart at
    the outermost level.[¶](#section-4-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-4-2.2}
3.  [If such a part is found and the content of the part conforms to the
    restrictions outlined above, remove the part from the message and
    process the part as a
    reaction.[¶](#section-4-2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-4-2.3}

Note: A message\'s content might include other, nested messages. These
can be analyzed for reactions, independently of the containing message,
applying the above algorithm for each contained message,
separately.[¶](#section-4-3.1){.pilcrow}

Again, the handling of a message that has been successfully processed is
MUA specific and beyond the scope of this
specification.[¶](#section-4-4){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-5 .section}
## [5.](#section-5){.section-number .selfRef} [Usability Considerations](#name-usability-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-usability-considerations}

This specification defines a mechanism for the structuring and carriage
of information. It does not define any user-level details of use.
However, the design of the user-level mechanisms associated with this
facility is paramount. This section discusses some issues to
consider.[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

Creation:
:   Because an email environment is different from a typical social
    media platform, there are significant \-- and potentially
    challenging \-- choices in the design of the user interface, to
    support indication of a reaction. Is the reaction to be sent only to
    the original author, or should it be sent to all recipients? Should
    the reaction always be sent in a discrete message containing only
    the reaction, or should the user also be able to include other
    message content? (Note that carriage of the reaction in a normal
    email message enables inclusion of this other
    content.)[¶](#section-5-2.2){.pilcrow}
:   

Display:
:   Reaction indications might be more useful when displayed in close
    visual proximity to the original message, rather than merely as part
    of an email response thread. The handling of multiple reactions,
    from the same person, is also an opportunity for making a user
    experience design choice that could be
    interesting.[¶](#section-5-2.4){.pilcrow}
:   

Culture:
:   The use of an image, intended to serve as a semantic signal, is
    determined and affected by cultural factors, which differ in
    complexity and nuance. It is important to remain aware that an
    author\'s intent when sending a particular emoji might not match how
    the recipient interprets it. Even simple, commonly used emojis can
    be subject to these cultural
    differences.[¶](#section-5-2.6){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-5.1 .section}
### [5.1.](#section-5.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Example Message](#name-example-message){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-example-message}

A simple message exchange might be:[¶](#section-5.1-1){.pilcrow}

:::

The Unicode character, represented here as \"{U+1F44D}\" for
readability, would actually be sent as the UTF-8-encoded
character.[¶](#section-5.1-5){.pilcrow}

The example could, of course, be more elaborate, such as the first of a
MIME multipart sequence.[¶](#section-5.1-6){.pilcrow}
:::

::: {#section-5.2 .section}
### [5.2.](#section-5.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Example Display](#name-example-display){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-example-display}

Repeating the caution that actual use of this capability requires
careful usability design and testing, this section describes simple
examples \-- which have not been tested \-- of how the reaction response
might be displayed in a summary list of
messages:[¶](#section-5.2-1){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

Summary:
:   Summary listings of messages in a folder include columns such as
    Subject, From, and Date. Another might be added to show common
    reactions and a count of how many of them have been
    received.[¶](#section-5.2-2.2){.pilcrow}
:   

Message:
:   A complete message is often displayed with a tailored section for
    header fields, enhancing the format and showing only selected header
    fields. A pseudo-field might be added for reactions, again showing
    the symbol and a count.[¶](#section-5.2-2.4){.pilcrow}

:::
:::

::: {#section-6 .section}
## [6.](#section-6){.section-number .selfRef} [Security Considerations](#name-security-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-security-considerations}

This specification employs message content that is a strict subset of
existing possible content and thus introduces no new content-specific
security considerations. The fact that this content is structured might
seem to make it a new threat surface, but there is no analysis
demonstrating that it does.[¶](#section-6-1){.pilcrow}

This specification defines a distinct Content-Disposition value for
specialized message content. Processing that handles the content
differently from other content in the message body might introduce
vulnerabilities. Since this capability is likely to produce new user
interaction features, that might also produce new social engineering
vulnerabilities.[¶](#section-6-2){.pilcrow}
:::

## [Acknowledgements](#name-acknowledgements){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-acknowledgements}

This specification had substantive commentary on three IETF mailing
lists.[¶](#appendix-A-1){.pilcrow}

This work began as a private exercise, in July 2020, with private
discussion, for draft-crocker-reply-emoji. It morphed into
draft-crocker-inreply-react, with significant discussion on the ietf-822
mailing list \<<https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/ietf-822>\>,
September through November 2020. The discussion produced a fundamental
change from proposing a new header field to instead defining a new
Content-Disposition type, as well as significantly enhancing its text
concerning Unicode. It also produced two additional
coauthors.[¶](#appendix-A-2){.pilcrow}

In November 2020, the Dispatch mailing list
\<<https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/dispatch>\> was queried about
the draft, but it produced no discussion, though it did garner one
statement of interest.[¶](#appendix-A-3){.pilcrow}

A 4-week Last Call was issued on this document, January 2021, resulting
in quite a bit of fresh discussion on the last-call mailing list
\<<https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/last-call>\> and producing
further changes to this document. After Last Call completed, additional
concerns regarding the Unicode-related details surfaced, producing yet
more changes to the document. It also produced a challenge that prompted
the current version of this Acknowledgements
section.[¶](#appendix-A-4){.pilcrow}

Readers who are interested in the details of the document\'s history are
encouraged to peruse the archives for the three lists, searching Subject
fields for \"react\".[¶](#appendix-A-5){.pilcrow}
