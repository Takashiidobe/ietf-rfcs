The TLS 1.3 \[[RFC8446](#RFC8446){.xref}\] handshake protocol provides
two mutually exclusive forms of server authentication. First, the server
can be authenticated by providing a signature certificate and creating a
valid digital signature to demonstrate that it possesses the
corresponding private key. Second, the server can be authenticated by
demonstrating that it possesses a pre-shared key (PSK) that was
established by a previous handshake. A PSK that is established in this
fashion is called a resumption PSK. A PSK that is established by any
other means is called an external PSK. This document specifies a TLS 1.3
extension permitting certificate-based server authentication to be
combined with an external PSK as an input to the TLS 1.3 key
schedule.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

Several implementors wanted to gain more experience with this
specification before producing a Standards Track RFC. As a result, this
specification is being published as an Experimental RFC to enable
interoperable implementations and gain deployment and operational
experience.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

The development of a large-scale quantum computer would pose a serious
challenge for the cryptographic algorithms that are widely deployed
today, including the digital signature algorithms that are used to
authenticate the server in the TLS 1.3 handshake protocol. It is an open
question whether or not it is feasible to build a large-scale quantum
computer, and if so, when that might happen. However, if such a quantum
computer is invented, many of the cryptographic algorithms and the
security protocols that use them would become
vulnerable.[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

The TLS 1.3 handshake protocol employs key agreement algorithms and
digital signature algorithms that could be broken by the development of
a large-scale quantum computer
\[[TRANSITION](#I-D.hoffman-c2pq){.xref}\]. The key agreement algorithms
include Diffie-Hellman (DH) \[[DH1976](#DH1976){.xref}\] and Elliptic
Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) \[[IEEE1363](#IEEE1363){.xref}\]; the
digital signature algorithms include RSA \[[RFC8017](#RFC8017){.xref}\]
and the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)
\[[FIPS186](#FIPS186){.xref}\]. As a result, an adversary that stores a
TLS 1.3 handshake protocol exchange today could decrypt the associated
encrypted communications in the future when a large-scale quantum
computer becomes available.[¶](#section-3-2){.pilcrow}

In the near term, this document describes a TLS 1.3 extension to protect
today\'s communications from the future invention of a large-scale
quantum computer by providing a strong external PSK as an input to the
TLS 1.3 key schedule while preserving the authentication provided by the
existing certificate and digital signature
mechanisms.[¶](#section-3-3){.pilcrow}

## [4.](#section-4){.section-number .selfRef} [Extension Overview](#name-extension-overview){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-extension-overview}

This section provides a brief overview of the
\"tls_cert_with_extern_psk\" extension.[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

The client includes the \"tls_cert_with_extern_psk\" extension in the
ClientHello message. The \"tls_cert_with_extern_psk\" extension
[MUST]{.bcp14} be accompanied by the \"key_share\",
\"psk_key_exchange_modes\", and \"pre_shared_key\" extensions. The
client [MAY]{.bcp14} also find it useful to include the
\"supported_groups\" extension. Since the \"tls_cert_with_extern_psk\"
extension is intended to be used only with initial handshakes, it [MUST
NOT]{.bcp14} be sent alongside the \"early_data\" extension. These
extensions are all described in [Section
4.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8446#section-4.2){.relref} of
\[[RFC8446](#RFC8446){.xref}\], which also requires the
\"pre_shared_key\" extension to be the last extension in the ClientHello
message.[¶](#section-4-2){.pilcrow}

If the client includes both the \"tls_cert_with_extern_psk\" extension
and the \"early_data\" extension, then the server [MUST]{.bcp14}
terminate the connection with an \"illegal_parameter\"
alert.[¶](#section-4-3){.pilcrow}

If the server is willing to use one of the external PSKs listed in the
\"pre_shared_key\" extension and perform certificate-based
authentication, then the server includes the
\"tls_cert_with_extern_psk\" extension in the ServerHello message. The
\"tls_cert_with_extern_psk\" extension [MUST]{.bcp14} be accompanied by
the \"key_share\" and \"pre_shared_key\" extensions. If none of the
external PSKs in the list provided by the client is acceptable to the
server, then the \"tls_cert_with_extern_psk\" extension is omitted from
the ServerHello message.[¶](#section-4-4){.pilcrow}

When the \"tls_cert_with_extern_psk\" extension is successfully
negotiated, the TLS 1.3 key schedule processing includes both the
selected external PSK and the (EC)DHE shared secret value. (EC)DHE
refers to Diffie-Hellman over either finite fields or elliptic curves.
As a result, the Early Secret, Handshake Secret, and Master Secret
values all depend upon the value of the selected external PSK. Of
course, the Early Secret does not depend upon the (EC)DHE shared
secret.[¶](#section-4-5){.pilcrow}

The authentication of the server and optional authentication of the
client depend upon the ability to generate a signature that can be
validated with the public key in their certificates. The authentication
processing is not changed in any way by the selected external
PSK.[¶](#section-4-6){.pilcrow}

Each external PSK is associated with a single hash algorithm, which is
required by [Section
4.2.11](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8446#section-4.2.11){.relref}
of \[[RFC8446](#RFC8446){.xref}\]. The hash algorithm [MUST]{.bcp14} be
set when the PSK is established, with a default of
SHA-256.[¶](#section-4-7){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-5 .section}
## [5.](#section-5){.section-number .selfRef} [Certificate with External PSK Extension](#name-certificate-with-external-p){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-certificate-with-external-p}

This section specifies the \"tls_cert_with_extern_psk\" extension, which
[MAY]{.bcp14} appear in the ClientHello message and ServerHello message.
It [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} appear in any other messages. The
\"tls_cert_with_extern_psk\" extension [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} appear in the
ServerHello message unless the \"tls_cert_with_extern_psk\" extension
appeared in the preceding ClientHello message. If an implementation
recognizes the \"tls_cert_with_extern_psk\" extension and receives it in
any other message, then the implementation [MUST]{.bcp14} abort the
handshake with an \"illegal_parameter\"
alert.[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

The general extension mechanisms enable clients and servers to negotiate
the use of specific extensions. Clients request extended functionality
from servers with the extensions field in the ClientHello message. If
the server responds with a HelloRetryRequest message, then the client
sends another ClientHello message as described in [Section
4.1.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8446#section-4.1.2){.relref} of
\[[RFC8446](#RFC8446){.xref}\], including the same
\"tls_cert_with_extern_psk\" extension as the original ClientHello
message, or aborts the handshake.[¶](#section-5-2){.pilcrow}

Many server extensions are carried in the EncryptedExtensions message;
however, the \"tls_cert_with_extern_psk\" extension is carried in the
ServerHello message. Successful negotiation of the
\"tls_cert_with_extern_psk\" extension affects the key used for
encryption, so it cannot be carried in the EncryptedExtensions message.
Therefore, the \"tls_cert_with_extern_psk\" extension is only present in
the ServerHello message if the server recognizes the
\"tls_cert_with_extern_psk\" extension and the server possesses one of
the external PSKs offered by the client in the \"pre_shared_key\"
extension in the ClientHello message.[¶](#section-5-3){.pilcrow}

The Extension structure is defined in \[[RFC8446](#RFC8446){.xref}\]; it
is repeated here for convenience.[¶](#section-5-4){.pilcrow}

The \"extension_type\" identifies the particular extension type, and the
\"extension_data\" contains information specific to the particular
extension type.[¶](#section-5-6){.pilcrow}

This document specifies the \"tls_cert_with_extern_psk\" extension,
adding one new type to ExtensionType:[¶](#section-5-7){.pilcrow}

  } ExtensionType;
```

[¶](#section-5-8){.pilcrow}
:::

The \"tls_cert_with_extern_psk\" extension is relevant when the client
and server possess an external PSK in common that can be used as an
input to the TLS 1.3 key schedule. The \"tls_cert_with_extern_psk\"
extension is essentially a flag to use the external PSK in the key
schedule, and it has the following syntax:[¶](#section-5-9){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-5-10}
``` {.sourcecode .lang-tls-presentation}

      select (Handshake.msg_type) {

[Section 4](#over){.xref} lists the extensions that are required to
accompany the \"tls_cert_with_extern_psk\" extension. Most of those
extensions are not impacted in any way by this specification. However,
this section discusses the extensions that require additional
consideration.[¶](#section-5.1-1){.pilcrow}

The \"psk_key_exchange_modes\" extension is defined in of [Section
4.2.9](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8446#section-4.2.9){.relref} of
\[[RFC8446](#RFC8446){.xref}\]. The \"psk_key_exchange_modes\" extension
restricts the use of both the PSKs offered in this ClientHello and those
that the server might supply via a subsequent NewSessionTicket. As a
result, when the \"psk_key_exchange_modes\" extension is included in the
ClientHello message, clients [MUST]{.bcp14} include psk_dhe_ke mode. In
addition, clients [MAY]{.bcp14} also include psk_ke mode to support a
subsequent NewSessionTicket. When the \"psk_key_exchange_modes\"
extension is included in the ServerHello message, servers [MUST]{.bcp14}
select the psk_dhe_ke mode for the initial handshake. Servers
[MUST]{.bcp14} select a key exchange mode that is listed by the client
for subsequent handshakes that include the resumption PSK from the
initial handshake.[¶](#section-5.1-2){.pilcrow}

The \"pre_shared_key\" extension is defined in [Section
4.2.11](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8446#section-4.2.11){.relref}
of \[[RFC8446](#RFC8446){.xref}\]. The syntax is repeated below for
convenience. All of the listed PSKs [MUST]{.bcp14} be external PSKs. If
a resumption PSK is listed along with the \"tls_cert_with_extern_psk\"
extension, the server [MUST]{.bcp14} abort the handshake with an
\"illegal_parameter\" alert.[¶](#section-5.1-3){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-5.1-4}
``` {.sourcecode .lang-tls-presentation}

      PskBinderEntry binders<33..2^16-1>;
  } OfferedPsks;

  struct {
      select (Handshake.msg_type) {
          case client_hello: OfferedPsks;
          case server_hello: uint16 selected_identity;
      };
  } PreSharedKeyExtension;
```

[¶](#section-5.1-4){.pilcrow}
:::

\"OfferedPsks\" contains the list of PSK identities and associated
binders for the external PSKs that the client is willing to use with the
server.[¶](#section-5.1-5){.pilcrow}

The identities are a list of external PSK identities that the client is
willing to negotiate with the server. Each external PSK has an
associated identity that is known to the client and the server; the
associated identities may be known to other parties as well. In
addition, the binder validation (see below) confirms that the client and
server have the same key associated with the
identity.[¶](#section-5.1-6){.pilcrow}

The \"obfuscated_ticket_age\" is not used for external PSKs. As stated
in [Section
4.2.11](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8446#section-4.2.11){.relref}
of \[[RFC8446](#RFC8446){.xref}\], clients [SHOULD]{.bcp14} set this
value to 0, and servers [MUST]{.bcp14} ignore the
value.[¶](#section-5.1-7){.pilcrow}

The binders are a series of HMAC \[[RFC2104](#RFC2104){.xref}\] values,
one for each external PSK offered by the client, in the same order as
the identities list. The HMAC value is computed using the binder_key,
which is derived from the external PSK, and a partial transcript of the
current handshake. Generation of the binder_key from the external PSK is
described in [Section
7.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8446#section-7.1){.relref} of
\[[RFC8446](#RFC8446){.xref}\]. The partial transcript of the current
handshake includes a partial ClientHello up to and including the
PreSharedKeyExtension.identities field, as described in [Section
4.2.11.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8446#section-4.2.11.2){.relref}
of \[[RFC8446](#RFC8446){.xref}\].[¶](#section-5.1-8){.pilcrow}

The \"selected_identity\" contains the index of the external PSK
identity that the server selected from the list offered by the client.
As described in [Section
4.2.11](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8446#section-4.2.11){.relref}
of \[[RFC8446](#RFC8446){.xref}\], the server [MUST]{.bcp14} validate
the binder value that corresponds to the selected external PSK, and if
the binder does not validate, the server [MUST]{.bcp14} abort the
handshake with an \"illegal_parameter\"
alert.[¶](#section-5.1-9){.pilcrow}

### [5.2.](#section-5.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Authentication](#name-authentication){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-authentication}

When the \"tls_cert_with_extern_psk\" extension is successfully
negotiated, authentication of the server depends upon the ability to
generate a signature that can be validated with the public key in the
server\'s certificate. This is accomplished by the server sending the
Certificate and CertificateVerify messages, as described in Sections
[4.4.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8446#section-4.4.2){.relref}
and
[4.4.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8446#section-4.4.3){.relref}
of \[[RFC8446](#RFC8446){.xref}\].[¶](#section-5.2-1){.pilcrow}

TLS 1.3 does not permit the server to send a CertificateRequest message
when a PSK is being used. This restriction is removed when the
\"tls_cert_with_extern_psk\" extension is negotiated, allowing
certificate-based authentication for both the client and the server. If
certificate-based client authentication is desired, this is accomplished
by the client sending the Certificate and CertificateVerify messages as
described in Sections
[4.4.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8446#section-4.4.2){.relref}
and
[4.4.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8446#section-4.4.3){.relref}

7.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8446#section-7.1){.relref} of
\[[RFC8446](#RFC8446){.xref}\] specifies the TLS 1.3 key schedule. The
successful negotiation of the \"tls_cert_with_extern_psk\" extension
requires the key schedule processing to include both the external PSK
and the (EC)DHE shared secret value.[¶](#section-5.3-1){.pilcrow}

If the client and the server have different values associated with the
selected external PSK identifier, then the client and the server will
compute different values for every entry in the key schedule, which will
lead to the client aborting the handshake with a \"decrypt_error\"
alert.[¶](#section-5.3-2){.pilcrow}

TLS 1.3 \[[RFC8446](#RFC8446){.xref}\] does not permit the server to
send a CertificateRequest message when a PSK is being used. This
restriction is removed when the \"tls_cert_with_extern_psk\" extension
is offered by the client and accepted by the server. However, TLS 1.3
does not permit an external PSK to be used in the same fashion as a
resumption PSK, and this extension does not alter those restrictions.
Thus, a certificate [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be used with a resumption
PSK.[¶](#section-7-2){.pilcrow}

Implementations must protect the external pre-shared key (PSK).
Compromise of the external PSK will make the encrypted session content
vulnerable to the future development of a large-scale quantum computer.
However, the generation, distribution, and management of the external
PSKs is out of scope for this specification.[¶](#section-7-3){.pilcrow}

Implementers should not transmit the same content on a connection that
is protected with an external PSK and a connection that is not. Doing so
may allow an eavesdropper to correlate the connections, making the
content vulnerable to the future invention of a large-scale quantum
computer.[¶](#section-7-4){.pilcrow}

Implementations must generate external PSKs with a secure key-management
technique, such as pseudorandom generation of the key or derivation of
the key from one or more other secure keys. The use of inadequate
pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs) to generate external PSKs can
result in little or no security. An attacker may find it much easier to
reproduce the PRNG environment that produced the external PSKs and
search the resulting small set of possibilities, rather than brute-force
searching the whole key space. The generation of quality random numbers
is difficult. \[[RFC4086](#RFC4086){.xref}\] offers important guidance
in this area.[¶](#section-7-5){.pilcrow}

If the external PSK is known to any party other than the client and the
server, then the external PSK [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be the sole basis for
authentication. The reasoning is explained in Section 4.2 of
\[[K2016](#K2016){.xref}\]. When this extension is used, authentication
is based on certificates, not the external
PSK.[¶](#section-7-6){.pilcrow}

In this extension, the external PSK preserves confidentiality if the
(EC)DH key agreement is ever broken by cryptanalysis or the future
invention of a large-scale quantum computer. As long as the attacker
does not know the PSK and the key derivation algorithm remains unbroken,
the attacker cannot derive the session secrets, even if they are able to
compute the (EC)DH shared secret. Should the attacker be able compute
the (EC)DH shared secret, the forward-secrecy advantages traditionally
associated with ephemeral (EC)DH keys will no longer be relevant.
Although the ephemeral private keys used during a given TLS session are
destroyed at the end of a session, preventing the attacker from later
accessing them, these private keys would nevertheless be recoverable due
to the break in the algorithm. However, a more general notion of
\"secrecy after key material is destroyed\" would still be achievable
using external PSKs, if they are managed in a way that ensures their
destruction when they are no longer needed, and with the assumption that
the algorithms that use the external PSKs remain
quantum-safe.[¶](#section-7-7){.pilcrow}

TLS 1.3 key derivation makes use of the HMAC-based Key Derivation
Function (HKDF) algorithm, which depends upon the HMAC
\[[RFC2104](#RFC2104){.xref}\] construction and a hash function. This
extension provides the desired protection for the session secrets, as
long as HMAC with the selected hash function is a pseudorandom function
(PRF) \[[GGM1986](#GGM1986){.xref}\].[¶](#section-7-8){.pilcrow}

This specification does not require that the external PSK is known only
by the client and server. The external PSK may be known to a group.
Since authentication depends on the public key in a certificate,
knowledge of the external PSK by other parties does not enable
impersonation. Since confidentiality depends on the shared secret from
(EC)DH, knowledge of the external PSK by other parties does not enable
eavesdropping. However, group members can record the traffic of other
members and then decrypt it if they ever gain access to a large-scale
quantum computer. Also, when many parties know the external PSK, there
are many opportunities for theft of the external PSK by an attacker.
Once an attacker has the external PSK, they can decrypt stored traffic
if they ever gain access to a large-scale quantum computer, in the same
manner as a legitimate group member.[¶](#section-7-9){.pilcrow}

TLS 1.3 \[[RFC8446](#RFC8446){.xref}\] takes a conservative approach to
PSKs; they are bound to a specific hash function and KDF. By contrast,
TLS 1.2 \[[RFC5246](#RFC5246){.xref}\] allows PSKs to be used with any
hash function and the TLS 1.2 PRF. Thus, the safest approach is to use a
PSK exclusively with TLS 1.2 or exclusively with TLS 1.3. Given one PSK,
one can derive a PSK for exclusive use with TLS 1.2 and derive another
PSK for exclusive use with TLS 1.3 using the mechanism specified in
\[[IMPORT](#I-D.ietf-tls-external-psk-importer){.xref}\].[¶](#section-7-10){.pilcrow}

TLS 1.3 \[[RFC8446](#RFC8446){.xref}\] has received careful security
analysis, and the following informal reasoning shows that the addition
of this extension does not introduce any security defects. This
extension requires the use of certificates for authentication, but the
processing of certificates is unchanged by this extension. This
extension places an external PSK in the key schedule as part of the
computation of the Early Secret. In the initial handshake without this
extension, the Early Secret is computed as:[¶](#section-7-11){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-7-12}
``` sourcecode
   Early Secret = HKDF-Extract(0, 0)
```

[¶](#section-7-12){.pilcrow}
:::

With this extension, the Early Secret is computed
as:[¶](#section-7-13){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-7-14}
``` sourcecode
   Early Secret = HKDF-Extract(External PSK, 0)
```

[¶](#section-7-14){.pilcrow}
:::

Any entropy contributed by the external PSK can only make the Early
Secret better; the External PSK cannot make it worse. For these two
reasons, TLS 1.3 continues to meet its security goals when this
extension is used.[¶](#section-7-15){.pilcrow}

[Appendix
E.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8446#appendix-E.6){.relref} of
\[[RFC8446](#RFC8446){.xref}\] discusses identity-exposure attacks on
PSKs. The guidance in this section remains
relevant.[¶](#section-8-1){.pilcrow}

This extension makes use of external PSKs to improve resilience against
attackers that gain access to a large-scale quantum computer in the
future. This extension is always accompanied by the \"pre_shared_key\"
extension to provide the PSK identities in plaintext in the ClientHello
message. Passive observation of the these PSK identities will aid an
attacker in tracking users of this extension.[¶](#section-8-2){.pilcrow}
