# DTLS Tunnel between a Media Distributor and Key Distributor to Facilitate Key Exchange {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

This document defines a protocol for tunneling DTLS traffic in
multimedia conferences that enables a Media Distributor to facilitate
key exchange between an endpoint in a conference and the Key
Distributor. The protocol is designed to ensure that the keying material
used for hop-by-hop encryption and authentication is accessible to the
Media Distributor, while the keying material used for end-to-end
encryption and authentication is inaccessible to the Media
Distributor.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

An objective of Privacy-Enhanced RTP Conferencing (PERC)
\[[RFC8871](#RFC8871){.xref}\] is to ensure that endpoints in a
multimedia conference have access to the end-to-end (E2E) and hop-by-hop
(HBH) keying material used to encrypt and authenticate Real-time
Transport Protocol (RTP) packets \[[RFC3550](#RFC3550){.xref}\], while
the Media Distributor has access only to the HBH keying material for
encryption and authentication.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

This specification defines a tunneling protocol that enables the Media
Distributor to tunnel DTLS messages \[[RFC9147](#RFC9147){.xref}\]
between an endpoint and a Key Distributor, thus allowing an endpoint to
use DTLS for the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (DTLS-SRTP)
\[[RFC5764](#RFC5764){.xref}\] for establishing encryption and
authentication keys with the Key Distributor.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

The tunnel established between the Media Distributor and Key Distributor
is a TLS connection \[[RFC8446](#RFC8446){.xref}\] that is established
before any messages are forwarded by the Media Distributor on behalf of
endpoints. DTLS packets received from an endpoint are encapsulated by
the Media Distributor inside this tunnel as data to be sent to the Key
Distributor. Likewise, when the Media Distributor receives data from the
Key Distributor over the tunnel, it extracts the DTLS message inside and
forwards the DTLS message to the endpoint. In this way, the DTLS
association for the DTLS-SRTP procedures is established between an
endpoint and the Key Distributor, with the Media Distributor forwarding
DTLS messages between the two entities via the established tunnel to the
Key Distributor and having no visibility into the confidential
information exchanged.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

Following the existing DTLS-SRTP procedures, the endpoint and Key
Distributor will arrive at a selected cipher and keying material, which
are used for HBH encryption and authentication by both the endpoint and
the Media Distributor. However, since the Media Distributor would not
have direct access to this information, the Key Distributor explicitly
shares the HBH key information with the Media Distributor via the
tunneling protocol defined in this document. Additionally, the endpoint
and Key Distributor will agree on a cipher for E2E encryption and
authentication. The Key Distributor will transmit keying material to the
endpoint for E2E operations but will not share that information with the
Media Distributor.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

By establishing this TLS tunnel between the Media Distributor and Key
Distributor and implementing the protocol defined in this document, it
is possible for the Media Distributor to facilitate the establishment of
a secure DTLS association between an endpoint and the Key Distributor in
order for the endpoint to generate E2E and HBH keying material. At the
same time, the Key Distributor can securely provide the HBH keying
material to the Media Distributor.[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}

The three entities involved in this communication flow are the endpoint,
the Media Distributor, and the Key Distributor. The behavior of each
entity is described in [Section
5](#tunneling-procedures){.xref}.[¶](#section-3-3){.pilcrow}

The Key Distributor is a logical function that might be co-resident with
a key management server operated by an enterprise, might reside in one
of the endpoints participating in the conference, or might reside at
some other location that is trusted with E2E keying
material.[¶](#section-3-4){.pilcrow}

This section provides an example message flow to help clarify the
procedures described later in this document. It is necessary that the
Key Distributor and Media Distributor establish a mutually authenticated
TLS connection for the purpose of sending tunneled messages, though the
complete TLS handshake for the tunnel is not shown in [Figure
2](#fig-message-flow){.xref} because there is nothing new this document
introduces with regard to those procedures.[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

Once the tunnel is established, it is possible for the Media Distributor
to relay the DTLS messages between the endpoint and the Key Distributor.
[Figure 2](#fig-message-flow){.xref} shows a message flow wherein the
endpoint uses DTLS-SRTP to establish an association with the Key
Distributor. In the process, the Media Distributor shares its supported
SRTP protection profile information (see
\[[RFC5764](#RFC5764){.xref}\]), and the Key Distributor shares the HBH
keying material and selected cipher with the Media
Distributor.[¶](#section-4-2){.pilcrow}

[Figure 2](#figure-2){.selfRef}: [Sample DTLS-SRTP Exchange via the
Tunnel](#name-sample-dtls-srtp-exchange-v){.selfRef}
:::

After the initial TLS connection has been established, each of the
messages on the right-hand side of [Figure 2](#fig-message-flow){.xref}
is a tunneling protocol message, as defined in [Section
6](#tunneling-protocol){.xref}.[¶](#section-4-4){.pilcrow}

SRTP protection profiles supported by the Media Distributor will be sent
in a `SupportedProfiles` message when the TLS tunnel is initially
established. The Key Distributor will use that information to select a
common profile supported by both the endpoint and the Media Distributor
to ensure that HBH operations can be successfully
performed.[¶](#section-4-5){.pilcrow}

As DTLS messages are received from the endpoint by the Media
Distributor, they are forwarded to the Key Distributor encapsulated
inside a `TunneledDtls` message. Likewise, as `TunneledDtls` messages
are received by the Media Distributor from the Key Distributor, the
encapsulated DTLS packet is forwarded to the
endpoint.[¶](#section-4-6){.pilcrow}

The Key Distributor will provide the SRTP keying material
\[[RFC3711](#RFC3711){.xref}\] to the Media Distributor for HBH
operations via the `MediaKeys` message. The Media Distributor will
extract this keying material from the `MediaKeys` message when received
and use it for HBH encryption and
authentication.[¶](#section-4-7){.pilcrow}

The following subsections explain in detail the expected behavior of the
endpoint, the Media Distributor, and the Key
Distributor.[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

It is important to note that the tunneling protocol described in this
document is not an extension to TLS or DTLS. Rather, it is a protocol
that transports DTLS messages generated by an endpoint or Key
Distributor as data inside of the TLS connection established between the
Media Distributor and Key Distributor.[¶](#section-5-2){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-5.1 .section}
### [5.1.](#section-5.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Endpoint Procedures](#name-endpoint-procedures){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-endpoint-procedures}

The endpoint follows the procedures outlined for DTLS-SRTP
\[[RFC5764](#RFC5764){.xref}\] in order to establish the cipher and keys
used for encryption and authentication, with the endpoint acting as the
client and the Key Distributor acting as the server. The endpoint does
not need to be aware of the fact that DTLS messages it transmits toward
the Media Distributor are being tunneled to the Key
Distributor.[¶](#section-5.1-1){.pilcrow}

The endpoint [MUST]{.bcp14} include a unique identifier in the `tls-id`
Session Description Protocol (SDP) attribute
\[[RFC8866](#RFC8866){.xref}\] in all offer and answer messages
\[[RFC3264](#RFC3264){.xref}\] that it generates, as per
\[[RFC8842](#RFC8842){.xref}\]. Further, the endpoint [MUST]{.bcp14}
include this same unique identifier in the `external_session_id`
extension \[[RFC8844](#RFC8844){.xref}\] in the `ClientHello` message
when establishing a DTLS association.[¶](#section-5.1-2){.pilcrow}

When receiving an `external_session_id` value from the Key Distributor,
the client [MUST]{.bcp14} check to ensure that value matches the
`tls-id` value received in SDP. If the values do not match, the endpoint
[MUST]{.bcp14} consider any received keying material to be invalid and
terminate the DTLS association.[¶](#section-5.1-3){.pilcrow}

Either the Media Distributor or Key Distributor initiates the
establishment of a TLS tunnel. Which entity acts as the TLS client when
establishing the tunnel and what event triggers the establishment of the
tunnel are outside the scope of this document. Further, how the trust
relationships are established between the Key Distributor and Media
Distributor are also outside the scope of this
document.[¶](#section-5.2-1){.pilcrow}

A tunnel [MUST]{.bcp14} be a mutually authenticated TLS
connection.[¶](#section-5.2-2){.pilcrow}

The Media Distributor or Key Distributor [MUST]{.bcp14} establish a
tunnel prior to forwarding tunneled DTLS messages. Given the
time-sensitive nature of DTLS-SRTP procedures, a tunnel [SHOULD]{.bcp14}
be established prior to the Media Distributor receiving a DTLS message
from an endpoint.[¶](#section-5.2-3){.pilcrow}

A single tunnel [MAY]{.bcp14} be used to relay DTLS messages between any
number of endpoints and the Key
Distributor.[¶](#section-5.2-4){.pilcrow}

A Media Distributor [MAY]{.bcp14} have more than one tunnel established
between itself and one or more Key Distributors. When multiple tunnels
are established, which tunnel or tunnels to use to send messages for a
given conference is outside the scope of this
document.[¶](#section-5.2-5){.pilcrow}

### [5.3.](#section-5.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Media Distributor Tunneling Procedures](#name-media-distributor-tunneling){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-media-distributor-tunneling}

The first message transmitted over the tunnel is the `SupportedProfiles`
message (see [Section 6](#tunneling-protocol){.xref}). This message
informs the Key Distributor about which DTLS-SRTP profiles the Media
Distributor supports. This message [MUST]{.bcp14} be sent each time a
new tunnel connection is established or, in the case of connection loss,
when a connection is re-established. The Media Distributor
[MUST]{.bcp14} support the same list of protection profiles for the
duration of any endpoint-initiated DTLS association and tunnel
connection.[¶](#section-5.3-1){.pilcrow}

The Media Distributor [MUST]{.bcp14} assign a unique association
identifier for each endpoint-initiated DTLS association and include it
in all messages forwarded to the Key Distributor. The Key Distributor
will subsequently include this identifier in all messages it sends so
that the Media Distributor can map messages received via a tunnel and
forward those messages to the correct endpoint. The association
identifier [MUST]{.bcp14} be a version 4 Universally Unique Identifier
(UUID), as described in [Section
4.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4122#section-4.4){.relref} of
\[[RFC4122](#RFC4122){.xref}\].[¶](#section-5.3-2){.pilcrow}

When a DTLS message is received by the Media Distributor from an
endpoint, it forwards the UDP payload portion of that message to the Key
Distributor encapsulated in a `TunneledDtls` message. The Media
Distributor is not required to forward all messages received from an
endpoint for a given DTLS association through the same tunnel if more
than one tunnel has been established between it and a Key
Distributor.[¶](#section-5.3-3){.pilcrow}

When a `MediaKeys` message is received, the Media Distributor
[MUST]{.bcp14} extract the cipher and keying material conveyed in order
to subsequently perform HBH encryption and authentication operations for
RTP and RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) packets sent between it and an
endpoint. Since the HBH keying material will be different for each
endpoint, the Media Distributor uses the association identifier included
by the Key Distributor to ensure that the HBH keying material is used
with the correct endpoint.[¶](#section-5.3-4){.pilcrow}

The Media Distributor [MUST]{.bcp14} forward all DTLS messages received
from either the endpoint or the Key Distributor (via the `TunneledDtls`
message) to ensure proper communication between those two
entities.[¶](#section-5.3-5){.pilcrow}

When the Media Distributor detects an endpoint has disconnected or when
it receives conference control messages indicating the endpoint is to be
disconnected, the Media Distributor [MUST]{.bcp14} send an
`EndpointDisconnect` message with the association identifier assigned to
the endpoint to the Key Distributor. The Media Distributor
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} take a loss of all RTP and RTCP packets as an indicator
that the endpoint has disconnected. The particulars of how RTP and RTCP
are to be used to detect an endpoint disconnect, such as timeout period,
are not specified. The Media Distributor [MAY]{.bcp14} use additional
indicators to determine when an endpoint has
disconnected.[¶](#section-5.3-6){.pilcrow}

Each TLS tunnel established between the Media Distributor and the Key
Distributor [MUST]{.bcp14} be mutually
authenticated.[¶](#section-5.4-1){.pilcrow}

When the Media Distributor relays a DTLS message from an endpoint, the
Media Distributor will include an association identifier that is unique
per endpoint-originated DTLS association. The association identifier
remains constant for the life of the DTLS association. The Key
Distributor identifies each distinct endpoint-originated DTLS
association by the association identifier.[¶](#section-5.4-2){.pilcrow}

When processing an incoming endpoint association, the Key Distributor
[MUST]{.bcp14} extract the `external_session_id` value transmitted in
the `ClientHello` message and match that against the `tls-id` value the
endpoint transmitted via SDP. If the values in SDP and the `ClientHello`
message do not match, the DTLS association [MUST]{.bcp14} be
rejected.[¶](#section-5.4-3){.pilcrow}

The process through which the `tls-id` value in SDP is conveyed to the
Key Distributor is outside the scope of this
document.[¶](#section-5.4-4){.pilcrow}

The Key Distributor [MUST]{.bcp14} match the fingerprint of the
certificate and `external_session_id` \[[RFC8844](#RFC8844){.xref}\]
received from the endpoint via DTLS with the expected fingerprint
\[[RFC8122](#RFC8122){.xref}\] and `tls-id`
\[[RFC8842](#RFC8842){.xref}\] values received via SDP. It is through
this process that the Key Distributor can be sure to deliver the correct
conference key to the endpoint.[¶](#section-5.4-5){.pilcrow}

The Key Distributor [MUST]{.bcp14} report its own unique identifier in
the `external_session_id` extension. This extension is sent in the
`EncryptedExtensions` message in DTLS 1.3 and the `ServerHello` message
in previous DTLS versions. This value [MUST]{.bcp14} also be conveyed
back to the client via SDP as a `tls-id`
attribute.[¶](#section-5.4-6){.pilcrow}

The Key Distributor [MUST]{.bcp14} encapsulate any DTLS message it sends
to an endpoint inside a `TunneledDtls` message (see [Section
6](#tunneling-protocol){.xref}). The Key Distributor is not required to
transmit all messages for a given DTLS association through the same
tunnel if more than one tunnel has been established between it and the
Media Distributor.[¶](#section-5.4-7){.pilcrow}

The Key Distributor [MUST]{.bcp14} use the same association identifier
in messages sent to an endpoint as was received in messages from that
endpoint. This ensures the Media Distributor can forward the messages to
the correct endpoint.[¶](#section-5.4-8){.pilcrow}

The Key Distributor extracts tunneled DTLS messages from an endpoint and
acts on those messages as if that endpoint had established the DTLS
association directly with the Key Distributor. The Key Distributor is
acting as the DTLS server, and the endpoint is acting as the DTLS
client. The handling of the messages and certificates is exactly the
same as normal DTLS-SRTP procedures between
endpoints.[¶](#section-5.4-9){.pilcrow}

The Key Distributor [MUST]{.bcp14} send a `MediaKeys` message to the
Media Distributor immediately after the DTLS handshake completes. The
`MediaKeys` message includes the selected cipher (i.e., protection
profile), Master Key Identifier (MKI) value
\[[RFC3711](#RFC3711){.xref}\] (if any), HBH SRTP master keys, and SRTP
master salt values. The Key Distributor [MUST]{.bcp14} use the same
association identifier in the `MediaKeys` message as is used in the
`TunneledDtls` messages for the given
endpoint.[¶](#section-5.4-10){.pilcrow}

There are presently two SRTP protection profiles defined for PERC,
namely `DOUBLE_AEAD_AES_128_GCM_AEAD_AES_128_GCM` and
`DOUBLE_AEAD_AES_256_GCM_AEAD_AES_256_GCM`
\[[RFC8723](#RFC8723){.xref}\]. As explained in [Section
5.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8723#section-5.2){.relref} of
\[[RFC8723](#RFC8723){.xref}\], the Media Distributor is only given the
SRTP master key for HBH operations. As such, the SRTP master key length
advertised in the `MediaKeys` message is half the length of the key
normally associated with the selected \"double\" protection
profile.[¶](#section-5.4-11){.pilcrow}

The Key Distributor uses the certificate fingerprint of the endpoint
along with the unique identifier received in the `external_session_id`
extension to determine with which conference a given DTLS association is
associated.[¶](#section-5.4-12){.pilcrow}

The Key Distributor [MUST]{.bcp14} select a cipher that is supported by
itself, the endpoint, and the Media Distributor to ensure proper HBH
operations.[¶](#section-5.4-13){.pilcrow}

When the DTLS association between the endpoint and the Key Distributor
is terminated, regardless of which entity initiated the termination, the
Key Distributor [MUST]{.bcp14} send an `EndpointDisconnect` message with
the association identifier assigned to the endpoint to the Media
Distributor.[¶](#section-5.4-14){.pilcrow}

Since the Media Distributor sends the first message over the tunnel, it
effectively establishes the version of the protocol to be used. If that
version is not supported by the Key Distributor, the Key Distributor
[MUST]{.bcp14} transmit an `UnsupportedVersion` message containing the
highest version number supported and close the TLS
connection.[¶](#section-5.5-1){.pilcrow}

The Media Distributor [MUST]{.bcp14} take note of the version received
in an `UnsupportedVersion` message and use that version when attempting
to re-establish a failed tunnel connection. Note that it is not
necessary for the Media Distributor to understand the newer version of
the protocol to understand that the first message received is an
`UnsupportedVersion` message. The Media Distributor can determine from
the first four octets received what the version number is and that the
message is an `UnsupportedVersion` message. The rest of the data
received, if any, would be discarded and the connection closed (if not
already closed).[¶](#section-5.5-2){.pilcrow}

Since the procedures in this document rely on TLS
\[[RFC8446](#RFC8446){.xref}\] for transport security, the security
considerations for TLS should be reviewed when implementing the protocol
defined in this document.[¶](#section-9-1){.pilcrow}

While the tunneling protocol defined in this document does not use
DTLS-SRTP \[[RFC5764](#RFC5764){.xref}\] directly, it does convey and
negotiate some of the same information (e.g., protection profile data).
As such, a review of the security considerations found in that document
may be useful.[¶](#section-9-2){.pilcrow}

This document describes a means of securely exchanging keying material
and cryptographic transforms for both E2E and HBH encryption and
authentication of media between an endpoint and a Key Distributor via a
Media Distributor. Additionally, the procedures result in delivering HBH
information to the intermediary Media Distributor. The Key Distributor
and endpoint are the only two entities with access to both the E2E and
HBH keys, while the Media Distributor has access to only HBH
information. [Section
8.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8871#section-8.2){.relref} of
\[[RFC8871](#RFC8871){.xref}\] enumerates various attacks against which
one must guard when implementing a Media Distributor; these scenarios
are important to note.[¶](#section-9-3){.pilcrow}

A requirement in this document is that a TLS connection between the
Media Distributor and the Key Distributor be mutually authenticated. The
reason for this requirement is to ensure that only an authorized Media
Distributor receives the HBH keying material. If an unauthorized Media
Distributor gains access to the HBH keying material, it can easily cause
service degradation or denial by transmitting HBH-valid packets that
ultimately fail E2E authentication or replay protection checks (see
[Section
3.3.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3711#section-3.3.2){.relref} of
\[[RFC3711](#RFC3711){.xref}\]). Even if service does not appear
degraded in any way, transmitting and processing bogus packets are a
waste of both computational and network
resources.[¶](#section-9-4){.pilcrow}

The procedures defined in this document assume that the Media
Distributor will properly convey DTLS messages between the endpoint and
Key Distributor. Should it fail in that responsibility by forwarding
DTLS messages from endpoint A advertised as being from endpoint B, this
will result in a failure at the DTLS layer of those DTLS sessions. This
could be an additional attack vector that Key Distributor
implementations should consider.[¶](#section-9-5){.pilcrow}

While E2E keying material passes through the Media Distributor via the
protocol defined in this document, the Media Distributor has no means of
gaining access to that information and therefore cannot affect the E2E
media processing function in the endpoint except to present it with
invalid or replayed data. That said, any entity along the path that
interferes with the DTLS exchange between the endpoint and the Key
Distributor, including a malicious Media Distributor that is not
properly authorized, could prevent an endpoint from properly
communicating with the Key Distributor and therefore prevent successful
conference participation.[¶](#section-9-6){.pilcrow}

It is worth noting that a compromised Media Distributor can convey
information to an adversary, such as participant IP addresses,
negotiated protection profiles, or other metadata. While
\[[RFC8871](#RFC8871){.xref}\] explains that a malicious or compromised
Media Distributor can disrupt communications, an additional attack
vector introduced by this protocol is the potential disruption of DTLS
negotiation or premature removal of a participant from a conference by
sending an `EndpointDisconnect` message to the Key
Distributor.[¶](#section-9-7){.pilcrow}

The Key Distributor should be aware of the possibility that a malicious
Media Distributor might transmit an `EndpointDisconnect` message to the
Key Distributor when the endpoint is in fact still
connected.[¶](#section-9-8){.pilcrow}

While the Security Considerations section of
\[[RFC8871](#RFC8871){.xref}\] describes various attacks one needs to
consider with respect to the Key Distributor and denial of service, use
of this protocol introduces another possible attack vector. Consider the
case where a malicious endpoint sends unsolicited DTLS-SRTP messages to
a Media Distributor. The Media Distributor will normally forward those
messages to the Key Distributor and, if found invalid, such messages
only serve to consume resources on both the Media Distributor and Key
Distributor.[¶](#section-9-9){.pilcrow}
