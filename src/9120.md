The \"arpa\" top-level domain \[[RFC3172](#RFC3172){.xref}\] is
designated as an \"infrastructure domain\" to support techniques defined
by Internet standards. Zones under the \"arpa\" domain provide various
mappings, such as IP addresses to domain names and E.164 numbers to
URIs. It also contains special-use names such as \"home\", which is a
nonunique name used in residential networks.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

Historically, the \"arpa\" zone has been hosted on almost all of the
root nameservers (NSs), and \[[RFC3172](#RFC3172){.xref}\] envisages the
\"arpa\" domain to be \"sufficiently critical that the operational
requirements for the root servers apply to the operational requirements
of the \"arpa\" servers\". To date, this has been implemented by serving
the \"arpa\" domain directly on a subset of the root server
infrastructure.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

This bundling of root nameserver and \"arpa\" nameserver operations has
entwined management of the zones\' contents and their infrastructures.
As a result, some proposals under consideration by the IETF involving
the \"arpa\" zone have been discarded due to the risk of conflict with
operations associated with managing the content of the root zone or
administering the root nameservers.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

The separation described in this document resolves the operational
impacts of synchronizing edits to the root zone and the \"arpa\" zone by
eliminating the current dependency and allowing more tailored operations
based on the unique requirements of each
zone.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

## [2.](#section-2){.section-number .selfRef} [Requirements for the \"arpa\" Zone](#name-requirements-for-the-arpa-z){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-requirements-for-the-arpa-z}

The \"arpa\" domain continues to play a role in critical Internet
operations, and this change does not propose weakening operational
requirements described in \[[RFC3172](#RFC3172){.xref}\] for the domain.
Future operational requirements for the \"arpa\" domain are encouraged
to follow strong baseline requirements such as those documented in
\[[RFC7720](#RFC7720){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2-1){.pilcrow}

Changes to the administration of the \"arpa\" zone do not alter the
management practices of other zones delegated within the \"arpa\"
namespace. For example, \"ip6.arpa\" would continue to be managed in
accordance with
\[[RFC5855](#RFC5855){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2-2){.pilcrow}

::: {#transition-process}
::: {#section-3 .section}
## [3.](#section-3){.section-number .selfRef} [Transition Process](#name-transition-process){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-transition-process}

The process will dedicate new hostnames to the servers that are
authoritative for the \"arpa\" zone, but it will initially serve the
\"arpa\" zone from the same hosts.[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

Once completed, subsequent transitional phases could include using new
hosts to replace or augment the existing root nameserver hosts and
separating the editing and distribution of the \"arpa\" zone from
necessarily being connected to the root zone. Any future management
considerations regarding how such changes may be performed are beyond
the scope of this document.[¶](#section-3-2){.pilcrow}

::: {#dedicated-nameserver-hostnames}
::: {#section-3.1 .section}
### [3.1.](#section-3.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Dedicated Nameserver Hostnames](#name-dedicated-nameserver-hostna){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-dedicated-nameserver-hostna}

Consistent with the use of the \"arpa\" namespace itself to host
nameservers for other delegations in the \"arpa\" zone
\[[RFC5855](#RFC5855){.xref}\], this document specifies a new namespace
of \"ns.arpa\", with the nameserver set for the \"arpa\" zone to be
initially labeled as follows:[¶](#section-3.1-1){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-3.1-2 .alignLeft .art-text .artwork}
       a.ns.arpa
       b.ns.arpa
       c.ns.arpa
       ...

[¶](#section-3.1-2){.pilcrow}
:::

Dedicated hostnames eliminate a logical dependency that requires the
coordinated editing of the nameservers for the \"arpa\" zone and the
root zone. This component of this transition does not require that the
underlying hosts that provide \"arpa\" name service (that is, the root
nameservers) be altered. The \"arpa\" zone will initially map the new
hostnames to the same IP addresses that already provide service under
the respective hostnames within
\"root-servers.net\".[¶](#section-3.1-3){.pilcrow}

Because these nameservers are completely within the \"arpa\" zone, they
will require glue records in the root zone. This is consistent with
current practice and requires no operational changes to the root
zone.[¶](#section-3.1-4){.pilcrow}

### [3.2.](#section-3.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Separation of Infrastructure](#name-separation-of-infrastructur){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-separation-of-infrastructur}

After initially migrating the \"arpa\" zone to use hostnames that are
not shared with the root zone, the underlying name service is expected
to evolve such that it no longer directly aligns with a subset of root
nameserver instances. With no shared infrastructure between the root
nameservers and the \"arpa\" nameservers, future novel applications for
the \"arpa\" zone may be possible.[¶](#section-3.2-1){.pilcrow}

Any subsequent change to the parties providing name service for the zone
is considered a normal management responsibility and would be performed
in accordance with
\[[RFC3172](#RFC3172){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3.2-2){.pilcrow}

### [3.3.](#section-3.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Zone Administration](#name-zone-administration){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-zone-administration}

Publication of the \"arpa\" zone file to the authoritative \"arpa\"
nameservers is currently undertaken alongside the root zone maintenance
functions. Upon the separation of the \"arpa\" infrastructure from the
root nameserver infrastructure, publication of the \"arpa\" zone no
longer necessarily needs to be technically linked or interrelated to the
root zone publication mechanisms.[¶](#section-3.3-1){.pilcrow}

### [3.4.](#section-3.4){.section-number .selfRef} [Conclusion of Process](#name-conclusion-of-process){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-conclusion-of-process}

Full technical separation of operations of the \"arpa\" zone and root
zone minimally requires the following to be
satisfied:[¶](#section-3.4-1){.pilcrow}

-   [The \"arpa\" zone no longer shares any hostnames in its nameserver
    set with the root
    zone.[¶](#section-3.4-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.4-2.1}
-   [The hosts that provide authoritative name service are not the same
    hosts as the root nameservers, do not share any IPv4 or IPv6
    addresses with the root servers, and are sufficiently provisioned
    separately such that any unique \"arpa\" zone requirements can be
    deployed without affecting how root zone service is
    provided.[¶](#section-3.4-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.4-2.2}
-   [The editorial and publication process for the \"arpa\" zone removes
    any common dependencies with the root zone process so that the
    \"arpa\" zone can be managed, edited, and provisioned wholly
    independently of the root
    zone.[¶](#section-3.4-2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.4-2.3}

Such separation is ultimately sought to allow for novel uses of the
\"arpa\" zone without the risk of inadvertently impacting root zone and
root server operations. It is recognized that achieving this state
requires a deliberative process involving significant coordination to
ensure impacts are minimized.[¶](#section-3.4-3){.pilcrow}

## [4.](#section-4){.section-number .selfRef} [IANA Considerations](#name-iana-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-iana-considerations}

IANA shall coordinate the creation of the \"ns.arpa\" namespace and
populate it with address records that reflect the IP addresses of the
contemporary root servers documented within \"root-servers.net\" as its
initial state. The namespace may be provisioned either directly within
the \"arpa\" zone (as an empty nonterminal) or through establishing a
dedicated \"ns.arpa\" zone, according to operational
requirements.[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

IANA will initially migrate the 12 NS records for the \"arpa\" zone to
point to their respective new entries in the \"ns.arpa\"
domain.[¶](#section-4-2){.pilcrow}

When these actions are complete, the IAB and IANA will consult and
coordinate with all relevant parties on activity to reduce or eliminate
reliance upon the root zone and root server infrastructure serving the
\"arpa\" zone. Such changes will be performed in compliance with
\[[RFC3172](#RFC3172){.xref}\] and shall be conducted with all due care
and deliberation to mitigate potential impacts on critical
infrastructure.[¶](#section-4-3){.pilcrow}

The security of the \"arpa\" zone is not necessarily impacted by any
aspects of these changes. Robust practices associated with administering
the content of the zone (including signing the zone with DNSSEC) as well
as its distribution will continue to be
necessary.[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}
