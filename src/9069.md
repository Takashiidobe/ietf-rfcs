# RFC 9069 {#rfcnum}

# Support for Local RIB in the BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

The BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) defines access to local Routing
Information Bases (RIBs). This document updates BMP (RFC 7854) by adding
access to the Local Routing Information Base (Loc-RIB), as defined in
RFC 4271. The Loc-RIB contains the routes that have been selected by the
local BGP speaker\'s Decision Process.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

This document defines a mechanism to monitor the BGP Loc-RIB state of
remote BGP instances without the need to establish BGP peering sessions.
BMP \[[RFC7854](#RFC7854){.xref}\] does not define a method to send the
BGP instance Loc-RIB. It does define locally originated routes in
[Section
8.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7854#section-8.2){.relref} of
\[[RFC7854](#RFC7854){.xref}\], but these routes are defined as the
routes that originated into BGP (e.g., [Section
9.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4271#section-9.4){.relref} of
\[[RFC4271](#RFC4271){.xref}\]). Loc-RIB includes all selected received
routes from BGP peers in addition to locally originated
routes.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

[Figure 1](#FigAdjRibInLocRib){.xref} shows the flow of received routes
from one or more BGP peers into the Loc-RIB.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

[Figure 1](#figure-1){.selfRef}: [BGP Peering Adj-RIBs-In into
Loc-RIB](#name-bgp-peering-adj-ribs-in-int){.selfRef}
:::

The following are some use cases for Loc-RIB
access:[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

-   ::: {#section-1-5.1}
    The Adj-RIB-In for a given peer post-policy may contain hundreds of
    thousands of routes, with only a handful of routes selected and
    installed in the Loc-RIB after best-path selection. Some monitoring
    applications, such as those that need only to correlate flow records
    to Loc-RIB entries, only need to collect and monitor the routes that
    are actually selected and used.[¶](#section-1-5.1.1){.pilcrow}

    Requiring the applications to collect all Adj-RIB-In post-policy
    data forces the applications to receive a potentially large unwanted
    data set and to perform the BGP decision process selection, which
    includes having access to the interior gateway protocol (IGP)
    next-hop metrics. While it is possible to obtain the IGP topology
    information using BGP - Link State (BGP-LS), it requires the
    application to implement Shortest Path First (SPF) and possibly
    Constrained Shortest Path First (CSPF) based on additional policies.
    This is overly complex for such a simple application that only needs
    to have access to the Loc-RIB.[¶](#section-1-5.1.2){.pilcrow}
    :::

-   [It is common to see frequent changes over many BGP peers, but those
    changes do not always result in the router\'s Loc-RIB changing. The
    change in the Loc-RIB can have a direct impact on the forwarding
    state. It can greatly reduce the time to troubleshoot and resolve
    issues if operators have the history of Loc-RIB changes. For
    example, a performance issue might have been seen for only a
    duration of 5 minutes. Post-facto troubleshooting this issue without
    Loc-RIB history hides any decision-based routing changes that might
    have happened during those 5
    minutes.[¶](#section-1-5.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-5.2}

-   [Operators may wish to validate the impact of policies applied to
    the Adj-RIB-In by analyzing the final decision made by the router
    when installing into the Loc-RIB. For example, in order to validate
    if multipath prefixes are installed as expected for all advertising
    peers, the Adj-RIB-In post-policy and Loc-RIB need to be compared.
    This is only possible if the Loc-RIB is available. Monitoring the
    Adj-RIB-In for this router from another router to derive the Loc-RIB
    is likely to not show the same installed prefixes. For example, the
    received Adj-RIB-In will be different if ADD-PATH
    \[[RFC7911](#RFC7911){.xref}\] is not enabled or if the maximum
    supported number of equal paths is different between Loc-RIB and
    advertised routes.[¶](#section-1-5.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-5.3}

This document adds Loc-RIB to the BGP Monitoring Protocol and replaces
[Section
8.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7854#section-8.2){.relref} of
\[[RFC7854](#RFC7854){.xref}\] (\"Locally Originated
Routes\").[¶](#section-1-6){.pilcrow}

Loc-RIB is used to build Adj-RIB-Out when advertising routes to a peer.
It is therefore possible to derive the Loc-RIB of a router by monitoring
the Adj-RIB-In pre-policy from another router. This becomes overly
complex and error prone when considering the number of peers being
monitored per router.[¶](#section-1.1-1){.pilcrow}

[Figure 2](#figure-2){.selfRef}: [Alternative Method to Monitor
Loc-RIB](#name-alternative-method-to-monito){.selfRef}
:::

The setup needed to monitor the Loc-RIB of a router requires another
router with a peering session to the target router that is to be
monitored. As shown in [Figure 2](#FigCurLocRibMon){.xref}, the target
router Loc-RIB is advertised via the Adj-RIB-Out to the BMP router over
a standard BGP peering session. The BMP router then forwards the
Adj-RIB-In pre-policy to the BMP receiver.[¶](#section-1.1-4){.pilcrow}

A BMP lacking access to Loc-RIB introduces the need for additional
resources:[¶](#section-1.1-5){.pilcrow}

-   [Requires at least two routers when only one router was to be
    monitored.[¶](#section-1.1-6.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-1.1-6.1}
-   [Requires additional BGP peering to collect the received updates
    when peering may not have even been required in the first place. For
    example, virtual routing and forwarding (VRF) tables with no peers,
    redistributed BGP-LS with no peers, and segment routing egress peer
    engineering where no peers have link-state address family enabled
    are all situations with no preexisting BGP
    peers.[¶](#section-1.1-6.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-1.1-6.2}

Many complexities are introduced when using a received Adj-RIB-In to
infer a router Loc-RIB:[¶](#section-1.1-7){.pilcrow}

-   [Adj-RIB-Out received as Adj-RIB-In from another router may have a
    policy applied that generates aggregates, suppresses more specific
    prefixes, manipulates attributes, or filters routes. Not only does
    this invalidate the Loc-RIB view, it adds complexity when multiple
    BMP routers may have peering sessions to the same router. The BMP
    receiver user is left with the error-prone task of identifying which
    peering session is the best representative of the
    Loc-RIB.[¶](#section-1.1-8.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-1.1-8.1}
-   [BGP peering is designed to work between administrative domains and
    therefore does not need to include internal system-level information
    of each peering router (e.g., the system name or version
    information). In order to derive the Loc-RIB of a router, the router
    name or other system information is needed. The BMP receiver and
    user are forced to do some type of correlation using whatever
    information is available in the peering session (e.g., peering
    addresses, autonomous system numbers, and BGP identifiers). This
    leads to error-prone
    correlations.[¶](#section-1.1-8.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-1.1-8.2}
-   [Correlating BGP identifiers (BGP-ID) and session addresses to a
    router requires additional data, such as router inventory. This
    additional data provides the BMP receiver the ability to map and
    correlate the BGP-IDs and/or session addresses but requires the BMP
    receiver to somehow obtain this data outside of the BMP. How this

There are several methods for a BGP speaker to implement Loc-RIB
efficiently. In all methods, the implementation emulates a peer with
Peer Up and Down messages to convey capabilities as well as Route
Monitor messages to convey Loc-RIB. In this sense, the peer that conveys
the Loc-RIB is a locally emulated peer.[¶](#section-6.1-1){.pilcrow}

There [MUST]{.bcp14} be at least one emulated peer for each Loc-RIB
instance, such as with VRFs. The BMP receiver identifies the Loc-RIB by
the peer header distinguisher and BGP ID. The BMP receiver uses the
VRF/Table Name from the Peer Up information to associate a name with the
Loc-RIB.[¶](#section-6.1.1-1){.pilcrow}

In some implementations, it might be required to have more than one
emulated peer for Loc-RIB to convey different address families for the
same Loc-RIB. In this case, the peer distinguisher and BGP ID should be
the same since they represent the same Loc-RIB instance. Each emulated
peer instance [MUST]{.bcp14} send a Peer Up with the OPEN message
indicating the address family capabilities. A BMP receiver
[MUST]{.bcp14} process these capabilities to know which peer belongs to
which address family.[¶](#section-6.1.1-2){.pilcrow}

only IBGP and EBGP should be sent and IGP redistributed routes excluded.
In these cases where the Loc-RIB is filtered, the F flag is set to 1 to
