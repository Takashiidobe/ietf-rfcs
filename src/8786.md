# RFC 8786 {#rfcnum}

# Updated Rules for Processing Stateful PCE Request Parameters Flags {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

Extensions to the Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP)
to support stateful Path Computation Elements (PCEs) are defined in RFC
8231. One of the extensions is the Stateful PCE Request Parameters (SRP)
object. That object includes a Flags field that is a set of 32 bit
flags, and RFC 8281 defines an IANA registry for tracking assigned
flags. However, RFC 8231 does not explain how an implementation should
set unassigned flags in transmitted messages, nor how an implementation
should process unassigned, unknown, or unsupported flags in received
messages.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

This document updates RFC 8231 by defining the correct
behaviors.[¶](#section-abstract-2){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC5440](#RFC5440){.xref}\] describes the Path Computation Element
Communication Protocol (PCEP). PCEP defines the communication between a
Path Computation Client (PCC) and a Path Computation Element (PCE), or
between PCEs, enabling computation of Multiprotocol Label Switching
(MPLS) for Traffic Engineering Label Switched Path (TE LSP)
characteristics.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC8231](#RFC8231){.xref}\] specifies a set of extensions to PCEP to
enable stateful control of LSPs within and across PCEP sessions in
compliance with \[[RFC4657](#RFC4657){.xref}\]. It includes mechanisms
to effect Label Switched Path (LSP) State Synchronization between PCCs
and PCEs, delegation of control over LSPs to PCEs, and PCE control of
timing and sequence of path computations within and across PCEP
sessions.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

One of the extensions defined in \[[RFC8231](#RFC8231){.xref}\] is the
Stateful PCE Request Parameters (SRP) object. That object includes a
Flags field that is a set of 32 bit flags, and RFC 8281 defines an IANA
registry for tracking assigned flags. However, RFC 8231 does not explain
how an implementation should set unassigned flags in transmitted
messages, nor how an implementation should process unassigned or unknown
flags in received messages.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

Furthermore, \[[RFC8231](#RFC8231){.xref}\] gives no guidance to the
authors of future specifications about how to describe the interaction
between flags that have already been defined and flags being defined in
the new specifications.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

This document updates RFC 8231 by defining the correct
behaviors.[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}

[Section 7](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8231#section-7){.relref}
of \[[RFC8231](#RFC8231){.xref}\] introduces changes to existing PCEP
objects and defines new PCEP objects and TLVs in support of stateful PCE
functionality. That text does not advise future specifications on how to
describe the interaction between flags that may be
defined.[¶](#section-3.1-1){.pilcrow}

The text in [Section

    PCEP object format defined in \[[RFC5440](#RFC5440){.xref}\]. The P

    [MUST]{.bcp14} be set to 0 on transmission and [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be
    ignored on receipt since they are exclusively related to path
    computation
    requests.[¶](#section-3.1-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.1-3.1}
-   [The sections that follow define PCEP objects and TLVs that contain
    Flags fields, and some flag values are defined. Future
    specifications may define further flags, and each new specification
    that defines additional flags is expected to describe the
    interaction between these new flags and any existing flags. In
    particular, new specifications are expected to explain how to handle
    the cases when both new and pre-existing flags are
    set.[¶](#section-3.1-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.1-3.2}

[Section
7.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8231#section-7.2){.relref} of
\[[RFC8231](#RFC8231){.xref}\] defines the PCEP SRP object. It describes
the Flags field as:[¶](#section-3.2-1){.pilcrow}

-   [Flags (32 bits): None defined
    yet.[¶](#section-3.2-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.2-2.1}

This document updates that text as follows:[¶](#section-3.2-3){.pilcrow}

-   [Flags (32 bits): This document does not define any flags.
    Unassigned flags [MUST]{.bcp14} be set to zero on transmission and
    [MUST]{.bcp14} be ignored on receipt. Implementations that do not
    understand any particular flag [MUST]{.bcp14} ignore the
    flag.[¶](#section-3.2-4.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.2-4.1}

## [4.](#section-4){.section-number .selfRef} [Compatibility Considerations](#name-compatibility-consideration){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-compatibility-consideration}

While one of the main objectives of the changes made by this document is
to enable backward compatibility, there remains an issue of
compatibility between existing implementations of RFC 8231 and
implementations that are consistent with this
document.[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

It should be noted that common behavior for Flags fields is as described
by the updated text presented in [Section 3](#update){.xref}. Thus, many
implementations, lacking guidance from RFC 8231, will still have
implemented a consistent and future-proof approach. However, for
completeness, it is worth noting how behaviors might interact between
implementations.[¶](#section-4-2){.pilcrow}

SRP objects generated by an implementation of this document will set all
unknown flag bits to zero and will therefore cause no issues to an older
implementation even if it inspects those bits. Similarly, an
implementation of this document will not inspect any unknown flag bits
and will therefore be unaffected by older implementations no matter how
they set the flags.[¶](#section-4-3){.pilcrow}

There will remain an issue with compatibility between implementations
and how they set the flags. An implementation of RFC 8231 might set any
of the unassigned flags, but an implementation of a future or current
specification (such as \[[RFC8281](#RFC8281){.xref}\] or
\[[RFC8741](#RFC8741){.xref}\]) assigns specific meanings to a flag if
set. That problem cannot be fixed in old implementations by any amount
of documentation and can only be handled for future specifications by
obsoleting the Flags field and using a new technique. Fortunately,
however, most implementations will have been constructed to set unused
flags to zero, which is consistent with the behavior described in this
document, and so the risk of bad interactions is sufficiently small that
there is no need to obsolete the existing Flags
field.[¶](#section-4-4){.pilcrow}

Implementations receiving set SRP flags that they do not recognize
[MAY]{.bcp14} log this. That could be helpful for diagnosing backward
compatibility issues with future features that utilize those
flags.[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC8231](#RFC8231){.xref}\] sets out security considerations for PCEP
when used for communication with a stateful PCE. This document does not
change those considerations.[¶](#section-6-1){.pilcrow}

However, by defining the expected behavior of implementations, this
document may improve the stability of networks and thus reduce the
attack surface. That is, by reminding implementations to ignore unset
bits, it is less possible to attack them by randomly tweaking bits.
Furthermore, by reminding implementations to leave undefined bits unset,
the network is future-proofed against new definitions of previously
undefined bits.[¶](#section-6-2){.pilcrow}
