# RFC 8962 {#rfcnum}

# Establishing the Protocol Police {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

One mantra of the IETF is, \"We are not the Protocol Police.\" However,
to ensure that protocols are implemented and deployed in full compliance
with the IETF\'s standards, it is important to set up a body that is
responsible for assessing and enforcing correct protocol
behavior.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

This document formally establishes the Protocol Police. It defines the
body and sets out what aspects of IETF protocols they will police. This
document acts as a point of reference for networking engineers, law
enforcement officials, government representatives, and others. It also
provides advice on how to report issues to the Protocol
Police.[¶](#section-abstract-2){.pilcrow}

## [1.](#section-1){.section-number .selfRef} [Introduction](#name-introduction){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-introduction}

IETF participants are often confronted with circumstances where
developers or deployers choose to not obey the sacrosanct words of an
RFC. This can lead to outcomes that are widely agreed to be unexpected,
unwarranted, or undesirable.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

Some are of the opinion that IETF participants should come to a
consensus and declare what protocol behavior is unacceptable, and that
the maintainers and developers of non-compliant protocols should be
chastised. Others (especially working group chairs) non-gracefully fall
back on the undocumented mantra, \"We \[or the IETF\] are not the
Protocol Police.\" Understandably, this has led to confusion about who
should make judgments about proper interpretation of protocol
specifications.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

This document formally establishes the Protocol Police, hitherto
undocumented at the IETF. It defines the body and sets out what aspects
of IETF protocols they will police. This document acts as a point of
reference for networking engineers, law enforcement officials,
government representatives, and others. It also provides advice on how
to report issues to the Protocol Police.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

The Protocol Police, as defined in this document, are responsible for
enforcing all IETF standards and best
practices.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}
:::

::: {#definitions}
::: {#section-2 .section}
## [2.](#section-2){.section-number .selfRef} [Definitions](#name-definitions){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-definitions}

For possibly the first time in IETF history, words like \"SHALL\" and
\"MAY\" are used in this document in their real and enforceable
sense.[¶](#section-2-1){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-3 .section}
## [3.](#section-3){.section-number .selfRef} [Composition of the Protocol Police](#name-composition-of-the-protocol){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-composition-of-the-protocol}

The Protocol Police shall be selected by the IETF Nominating Committee
(NomCom) as laid out in \[[RFC3797](#RFC3797){.xref}\] in a manner
similar to that used to select the IAB and IESG
\[[RFC8713](#RFC8713){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

However, the members of the Protocol Police shall not be publicly named.
This will enable them to operate more effectively and without
interference or unwarranted pressure from members of the community. The
first rule of the Protocol Police is
\$CIPHERTEXT.[¶](#section-3-2){.pilcrow}

### [3.1.](#section-3.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Recognizing the Protocol Police](#name-recognizing-the-protocol-po){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-recognizing-the-protocol-po}

When more than one person says, \"We are not the Protocol Police,\" at
least one of them is not telling the truth.[¶](#section-3.1-1){.pilcrow}

The Protocol Police love company and are never
alone.[¶](#section-3.1-2){.pilcrow}

You are not the Protocol Police: we are. We are not the Protocol Police:
you are.[¶](#section-3.1-3){.pilcrow}

If you are interested in joining the Protocol Police, contact your
localhost. Your behavior will be monitored, and your implementation will
be analyzed for full RFC compliance. If your deeds, both now and in the
past, are recognized to be true to the scripture, NomCom will of course
be instructed to induct you to the ranks. But if you have transgressed,
any information the investigation produces MAY be used against you in
future proceedings.[¶](#section-3.2-1){.pilcrow}

In making an assessment of your suitability for membership of the
Protocol Police, contact may be made on your behalf with the Internet
Moral Majority
\[[RFC4041](#RFC4041){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3.2-2){.pilcrow}

If you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to
fear.[¶](#section-3.2-3){.pilcrow}

Support for the existence and operation of the Protocol Police is
essential to the concept of \"policing by consent.\" Fortunately, the
IETF community and all stakeholders may now consider themselves served
by this document which, by dint of its existence, warrants
adherence.[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

Some boundaries must not be crossed. There are no acceptable layer
violations. Even though layers, like borders, are ambiguous abstractions
only serving to uphold the legitimacy and identity of the institutions
that produce them, they shall be observed and defended because the
Protocol Police exist to defend them.[¶](#section-5.1-1){.pilcrow}

The Protocol Police are sanctioned to gain access to any walled garden
that undermines interoperability. At the same time, the Protocol Police
will defend legacy interoperability options in all NTP eras (see
[Section 6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5905#section-6){.relref}
of \[[RFC5905](#RFC5905){.xref}\]), and will be reachable via the
Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) until at least era

In the beginning was the RFC, and the network was with the RFC, and the
RFC was with the network. Through the RFC all things were made; without
the RFC nothing was made that has been made. In the network was life,
and that life was the light of all the INTERNET. Thou shalt not deviate
from the path set out in the RFCs or else thou shall be scattered over
the data plane.[¶](#section-5.3-1){.pilcrow}

### [7.1.](#section-7.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Traffic Imprisonment](#name-traffic-imprisonment){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-traffic-imprisonment}

The Protocol Police will maintain a list of hosts and clients that have
demonstrated their inability to comprehend simple commandments contained
in RFCs, which all IETF participants know to be precise and accessible
even to a general audience.[¶](#section-7.1-1){.pilcrow}

If this work is standardized, IANA is requested to register the list of
addresses (see [Section 9](#iana-considerations){.xref}). For a period
specified in an official notification, all other networks SHALL drop all
network packets originating from or intended for such addresses. This
will result in effective and forced confinement of criminal
networks.[¶](#section-7.1-2){.pilcrow}

Using powerful machine-learning mechanisms for threat analysis, the
Protocol Police will identify networks that are likely to fail to comply
with this requirement. This process is known as Heuristic Internet
Policing (HIP). Networks identified in this way will be disciplined by
the Protocol Police with TCP RSTs. Let it be known: the Protocol Police
always shoot from the HIP.[¶](#section-7.1-3){.pilcrow}
