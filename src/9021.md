# Use of the Walnut Digital Signature Algorithm with CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

This document specifies the conventions for using the Walnut Digital
Signature Algorithm (WalnutDSA) for digital signatures with the CBOR
Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) syntax. WalnutDSA is a lightweight,
quantum-resistant signature scheme based on Group Theoretic Cryptography
with implementation and computational efficiency of signature
verification in constrained environments, even on 8- and 16-bit
platforms.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

The goal of this publication is to document a way to use the
lightweight, quantum-resistant WalnutDSA signature algorithm in COSE in
a way that would allow multiple developers to build compatible
implementations. As of this publication, the security properties of
WalnutDSA have not been evaluated by the IETF and its use has not been
endorsed by the IETF.[¶](#section-abstract-2){.pilcrow}

This document specifies the conventions for using the Walnut Digital
Signature Algorithm (WalnutDSA) \[[WALNUTDSA](#WALNUTDSA){.xref}\] for
digital signatures with the CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE)
syntax \[[RFC8152](#RFC8152){.xref}\]. WalnutDSA is a Group Theoretic
signature scheme \[[GTC](#GTC){.xref}\] where signature validation is
both computationally and space efficient, even on very small processors.
Unlike many hash-based signatures, there is no state required and no
limit on the number of signatures that can be made. WalnutDSA private
and public keys are relatively small; however, the signatures are larger
than RSA and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), but still smaller than
most all other quantum-resistant schemes (including all hash-based
schemes).[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

COSE provides a lightweight method to encode structured data. WalnutDSA
is a lightweight, quantum-resistant digital signature algorithm. The
goal of this specification is to document a method to leverage WalnutDSA
in COSE in a way that would allow multiple developers to build
compatible implementations.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

As with all cryptosystems, the initial versions of WalnutDSA underwent
significant cryptanalysis, and, in some cases, identified potential
issues. For more discussion on this topic, a summary of all published
cryptanalysis can be found in [Section 5.2](#meth_sec){.xref}. Validated
issues were addressed by reparameterization in updated versions of
WalnutDSA. Although the IETF has neither evaluated the security
properties of WalnutDSA nor endorsed WalnutDSA as of this publication,
this document provides a method to use WalnutDSA in conjunction with
IETF protocols. As always, users of any security algorithm are advised
to research the security properties of the algorithm and make their own
judgment about the risks involved.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-1.1 .section}
### [1.1.](#section-1.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Motivation](#name-motivation){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-motivation}

Recent advances in cryptanalysis \[[BH2013](#BH2013){.xref}\] and
progress in the development of quantum computers
\[[NAS2019](#NAS2019){.xref}\] pose a threat to widely deployed digital
signature algorithms. As a result, there is a need to prepare for a day
that cryptosystems such as RSA and DSA, which depend on discrete
logarithm and factoring, cannot be depended
upon.[¶](#section-1.1-1){.pilcrow}

If large-scale quantum computers are ever built, these computers will be
able to break many of the public key cryptosystems currently in use. A
post-quantum cryptosystem \[[PQC](#PQC){.xref}\] is a system that is
secure against quantum computers that have more than a trivial number of
quantum bits (qubits). It is open to conjecture when it will be feasible
to build such computers; however, RSA, DSA, the Elliptic Curve Digital
Signature Algorithm (ECDSA), and the Edwards-Curve Digital Signature
Algorithm (EdDSA) are all vulnerable if large-scale quantum computers
come to pass.[¶](#section-1.1-2){.pilcrow}

WalnutDSA does not depend on the difficulty of discrete logarithms or
factoring. As a result, this algorithm is considered to be resistant to
post-quantum attacks.[¶](#section-1.1-3){.pilcrow}

Today, RSA and ECDSA are often used to digitally sign software updates.
Unfortunately, implementations of RSA and ECDSA can be relatively large,
and verification can take a significant amount of time on some very
small processors. Therefore, we desire a digital signature scheme that
verifies faster with less code. Moreover, in preparation for a day when
RSA, DSA, and ECDSA cannot be depended upon, a digital signature
algorithm is needed that will remain secure even if there are
significant cryptanalytic advances or a large-scale quantum computer is
invented. WalnutDSA, specified in \[[WALNUTSPEC](#WALNUTSPEC){.xref}\],
is a quantum-resistant algorithm that addresses these
requirements.[¶](#section-1.1-4){.pilcrow}

This specification makes use of WalnutDSA signatures as described in
\[[WALNUTDSA](#WALNUTDSA){.xref}\] and more concretely specified in
\[[WALNUTSPEC](#WALNUTSPEC){.xref}\]. WalnutDSA is a Group Theoretic
cryptographic signature scheme that leverages infinite group theory as
the basis of its security and maps that to a one-way evaluation of a
series of matrices over small finite fields with permuted multiplicants
based on the group input. WalnutDSA leverages the SHA2-256 and SHA2-512
one-way hash algorithms \[[SHA2](#SHA2){.xref}\] in a hash-then-sign
process.[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

WalnutDSA is based on a one-way function, E-multiplication, which is an
action on the infinite group. A single E-multiplication step takes as
input a matrix and permutation, a generator in the group, and a set of
T-values (entries in the finite field) and outputs a new matrix and
permutation. To process a long string of generators (like a WalnutDSA
signature), E-multiplication is iterated over each generator. Due to its
structure, E-multiplication is extremely easy to
implement.[¶](#section-3-2){.pilcrow}

In addition to being quantum resistant, the two main benefits of using
WalnutDSA are that the verification implementation is very small and
WalnutDSA signature verification is extremely fast, even on very small
processors (including 16- and even 8-bit microcontrollers). This lends
it well to use in constrained and/or time-sensitive
environments.[¶](#section-3-3){.pilcrow}

WalnutDSA has several parameters required to process a signature. The
main parameters are N and q. The parameter N defines the size of the
group by defining the number of strands in use and implies working in an
NxN matrix. The parameter q defines the number of elements in the finite
field. Signature verification also requires a set of T-values, which is
an ordered list of N entries in the finite field
F_q.[¶](#section-3-4){.pilcrow}

A WalnutDSA signature is just a string of generators in the infinite
group, packed into a byte string.[¶](#section-3-5){.pilcrow}

The CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) syntax
\[[RFC8152](#RFC8152){.xref}\] supports two signature algorithm schemes.
This specification makes use of the signature with appendix scheme for
WalnutDSA signatures.[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

The signature value is a large byte string. The byte string is designed
for easy parsing, and it includes a length (number of generators) and
type codes that indirectly provide all of the information that is needed
to parse the byte string during signature
validation.[¶](#section-4-2){.pilcrow}

When using a COSE key for this algorithm, the following checks are
made:[¶](#section-4-3){.pilcrow}

### [5.1.](#section-5.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Implementation Security Considerations](#name-implementation-security-con){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-implementation-security-con}

Implementations [MUST]{.bcp14} protect the private keys. Use of a
hardware security module (HSM) is one way to protect the private keys.
Compromising the private keys may result in the ability to forge
signatures. As a result, when a private key is stored on non-volatile
media or stored in a virtual machine environment, care must be taken to
preserve confidentiality and integrity.[¶](#section-5.1-1){.pilcrow}

The generation of private keys relies on random numbers. The use of
inadequate pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs) to generate these
values can result in little or no security. An attacker may find it much
easier to reproduce the PRNG environment that produced the keys,
searching the resulting small set of possibilities, rather than brute
force searching the whole key space. The generation of quality random
numbers is difficult, and \[[RFC4086](#RFC4086){.xref}\] offers
important guidance in this area.[¶](#section-5.1-2){.pilcrow}

The generation of WalnutDSA signatures also depends on random numbers.
While the consequences of an inadequate PRNG to generate these values
are much less severe than the generation of private keys, the guidance
in \[[RFC4086](#RFC4086){.xref}\] remains
important.[¶](#section-5.1-3){.pilcrow}

### [5.2.](#section-5.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Method Security Considerations](#name-method-security-considerati){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-method-security-considerati}

The Walnut Digital Signature Algorithm has undergone significant
cryptanalysis since it was first introduced, and several weaknesses were
found in early versions of the method, resulting in the description of
several attacks with exponential computational complexity. A full
writeup of all the analysis can be found in
\[[WalnutDSAAnalysis](#WalnutDSAAnalysis){.xref}\]. In summary, the
original suggested parameters (N=8, q=32) were too small, leading to
many of these exponential-growth attacks being practical. However,
current parameters render these attacks impractical. The following
paragraphs summarize the analysis and how the current parameters defeat
all the previous attacks.[¶](#section-5.2-1){.pilcrow}

First, the team of Hart et al. found a universal forgery attack based on
a group-factoring problem that runs in O(q^(N-1)/2^) with a memory
complexity of log_2(q) N^2^ q^(N-1)/2^. With parameters N=10 and q=M31
(the Mersenne prime 2^31^ - 1), the runtime is 2^139^ and memory
complexity is 2^151^. W. Beullens found a modification of this attack
but its runtime is even longer.[¶](#section-5.2-2){.pilcrow}

Next, Beullens and Blackburn found several issues with the original
method and parameters. First, they used a Pollard-Rho attack and
discovered the original public key space was too small. Specifically,
they require that q^N(N-1)-1^ \> 2^2\*Security\ Level^. One can clearly
see that (N=10, q=M31) provides 128-bit security and (N=10, q=M61)
provides 256-bit security.[¶](#section-5.2-3){.pilcrow}

Beullens and Blackburn also found two issues with the original message
encoder of WalnutDSA. First, the original encoder was non-injective,
which reduced the available signature space. This was repaired in an
update. Second, they pointed out that the dimension of the vector space
generated by the encoder was too small. Specifically, they require that
q^dimension^ \> 2^(2\*Security\ Level)^. With N=10, the current encoder
produces a dimension of 66, which clearly provides sufficient security
with q=M31 or q=M61.[¶](#section-5.2-4){.pilcrow}

The final issue discovered by Beullens and Blackburn was a process to
theoretically \"reverse\" E-multiplication. First, their process
requires knowing the initial matrix and permutation (which are known for
WalnutDSA). But more importantly, their process runs at O(q^((N-1)/2)^),
which for (N=10, q=M31) is greater than
2^128^.[¶](#section-5.2-5){.pilcrow}

A team at Steven\'s Institute leveraged a length-shortening attack that
enabled them to remove the cloaking elements and then solve a conjugacy
search problem to derive the private keys. Their attack requires both
knowledge of the permutation being cloaked and also that the cloaking
elements themselves are conjugates. By adding additional concealed
cloaking elements, the attack requires an N! search for each cloaking
element. By inserting k concealed cloaking elements, this requires the
attacker to perform (N!)^k^ work. This allows k to be set to meet the
desired security level.[¶](#section-5.2-6){.pilcrow}

Finally, Merz and Petit discovered that using a Garside Normal Form of a
WalnutDSA signature enabled them to find commonalities with the Garside
Normal Form of the encoded message. Using those commonalities, they were
able to splice into a signature and create forgeries. Increasing the
number of cloaking elements, specifically within the encoded message,
sufficiently obscures the commonalities and blocks this
attack.[¶](#section-5.2-7){.pilcrow}

In summary, most of these attacks are exponential in runtime and it can
be shown that current parameters put the runtime beyond the desired
security level. The final two attacks are also sufficiently blocked to
the desired security level.[¶](#section-5.2-8){.pilcrow}
