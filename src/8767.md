# RFC 8767 {#rfcnum}

# Serving Stale Data to Improve DNS Resiliency {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

This document defines a method (serve-stale) for recursive resolvers to
use stale DNS data to avoid outages when authoritative nameservers
cannot be reached to refresh expired data. One of the motivations for
serve-stale is to make the DNS more resilient to DoS attacks and thereby
make them less attractive as an attack vector. This document updates the
definitions of TTL from RFCs 1034 and 1035 so that data can be kept in
the cache beyond the TTL expiry; it also updates RFC 2181 by
interpreting values with the high-order bit set as being positive,
rather than 0, and suggests a cap of 7
days.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

Traditionally, the Time To Live (TTL) of a DNS Resource Record (RR) has
been understood to represent the maximum number of seconds that a record
can be used before it must be discarded, based on its description and
usage in \[[RFC1035](#RFC1035){.xref}\] and clarifications in
\[[RFC2181](#RFC2181){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

This document expands the definition of the TTL to explicitly allow for
expired data to be used in the exceptional circumstance that a recursive
resolver is unable to refresh the information. It is predicated on the
observation that authoritative answer unavailability can cause outages
even when the underlying data those servers would return is typically
unchanged.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

We describe a method below for this use of stale data, balancing the
competing needs of resiliency and freshness.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

This document updates the definitions of TTL from
\[[RFC1034](#RFC1034){.xref}\] and \[[RFC1035](#RFC1035){.xref}\] so
that data can be kept in the cache beyond the TTL expiry; it also
updates \[[RFC2181](#RFC2181){.xref}\] by interpreting values with the
high-order bit set as being positive, rather than 0, and also suggests a
cap of 7 days.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

There are a number of reasons why an authoritative server may become
unreachable, including Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, network issues,
and so on. If a recursive server is unable to contact the authoritative
servers for a query but still has relevant data that has aged past its
TTL, that information can still be useful for generating an answer under
the metaphorical assumption that \"stale bread is better than no
bread.\"[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC1035](#RFC1035){.xref}\], [Section
3.2.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1035#section-3.2.1){.relref}
says that the TTL \"specifies the time interval that the resource record
may be cached before the source of the information should again be
consulted.\" \[[RFC1035](#RFC1035){.xref}\], [Section
4.1.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1035#section-4.1.3){.relref}
further says that the TTL \"specifies the time interval (in seconds)
that the resource record may be cached before it should be
discarded.\"[¶](#section-3-2){.pilcrow}

A natural English interpretation of these remarks would seem to be clear
enough that records past their TTL expiration must not be used. However,
\[[RFC1035](#RFC1035){.xref}\] predates the more rigorous terminology of
\[[RFC2119](#RFC2119){.xref}\], which softened the interpretation of
\"may\" and \"should\".[¶](#section-3-3){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC2181](#RFC2181){.xref}\] aimed to provide \"the precise definition
of the Time to Live,\" but [Section
8](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2181#section-8){.relref} of
\[[RFC2181](#RFC2181){.xref}\] was mostly concerned with the numeric
range of values rather than data expiration behavior. It does, however,
close that section by noting, \"The TTL specifies a maximum time to
live, not a mandatory time to live.\" This wording again does not
contain BCP 14 key words \[[RFC2119](#RFC2119){.xref}\], but it does
convey the natural language connotation that data becomes unusable past
TTL expiry.[¶](#section-3-4){.pilcrow}

As of the time of this writing, several large-scale operators use stale
data for answers in some way. A number of recursive resolver packages,
including BIND, Knot Resolver, OpenDNS, and Unbound, provide options to
use stale data. Apple macOS can also use stale data as part of the Happy
Eyeballs algorithms in mDNSResponder. The collective operational
experience is that using stale data can provide significant benefit with
minimal downside.[¶](#section-3-5){.pilcrow}

The definition of TTL in
Sections [3.2.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1035#section-3.2.1){.relref}
and
[4.1.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1035#section-4.1.3){.relref}
of \[[RFC1035](#RFC1035){.xref}\] is amended to
read:[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

TTL
:   a 32-bit unsigned integer number of seconds that specifies the
    duration that the resource record [MAY]{.bcp14} be cached before the
    source of the information [MUST]{.bcp14} again be consulted. Zero
    values are interpreted to mean that the RR can only be used for the
    transaction in progress, and should not be cached. Values
    [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be capped on the order of days to weeks, with a
    recommended cap of 604,800 seconds (7 days). If the data is unable
    to be authoritatively refreshed when the TTL expires, the record
    [MAY]{.bcp14} be used as though it is unexpired. See
    Sections [5](#example-method){.xref} and
    [6](#implementation-considerations){.xref} of \[RFC8767\] for
    details.[¶](#section-4-2.2){.pilcrow}

Interpreting values that have the high-order bit set as being positive,
rather than 0, is a change from \[[RFC2181](#RFC2181){.xref}\], the
rationale for which is explained in [Section
6](#implementation-considerations){.xref}. Suggesting a cap of 7 days,
rather than the 68 years allowed by the full 31 bits of [Section
8](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2181#section-8){.relref} of
\[[RFC2181](#RFC2181){.xref}\], reflects the current practice of major
modern DNS resolvers.[¶](#section-4-3){.pilcrow}

When returning a response containing stale records, a recursive resolver
[MUST]{.bcp14} set the TTL of each expired record in the message to a
value greater than 0, with a [RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14} value of 30 seconds.
See [Section 6](#implementation-considerations){.xref} for
explanation.[¶](#section-4-4){.pilcrow}

Answers from authoritative servers that have a DNS response code of
either 0 (NoError) or 3 (NXDomain) and the Authoritative Answer (AA) bit
set [MUST]{.bcp14} be considered to have refreshed the data at the
resolver. Answers from authoritative servers that have any other
response code [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be considered a failure to refresh the
data and therefore leave any previous state intact. See [Section
6](#implementation-considerations){.xref} for a
discussion.[¶](#section-4-5){.pilcrow}

There is more than one way a recursive resolver could responsibly
implement this resiliency feature while still respecting the intent of
the TTL as a signal for when data is to be
refreshed.[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

In this example method, four notable timers drive considerations for the
use of stale data:[¶](#section-5-2){.pilcrow}

-   [A client response timer, which is the maximum amount of time a
    recursive resolver should allow between the receipt of a resolution
    request and sending its
    response.[¶](#section-5-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-5-3.1}
-   [A query resolution timer, which caps the total amount of time a
    recursive resolver spends processing the
    query.[¶](#section-5-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-5-3.2}
-   [A failure recheck timer, which limits the frequency at which a
    failed lookup will be attempted
    again.[¶](#section-5-3.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-5-3.3}
-   [A maximum stale timer, which caps the amount of time that records
    will be kept past their
    expiration.[¶](#section-5-3.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-5-3.4}

Most recursive resolvers already have the query resolution timer and,
effectively, some kind of failure recheck timer. The client response
timer and maximum stale timer are new concepts for this
mechanism.[¶](#section-5-4){.pilcrow}

When a recursive resolver receives a request, it should start the client
response timer. This timer is used to avoid client timeouts. It should
be configurable, with a recommended value of 1.8 seconds as being just
under a common timeout value of 2 seconds while still giving the
resolver a fair shot at resolving the name.[¶](#section-5-5){.pilcrow}

The resolver then checks its cache for any unexpired records that
satisfy the request and returns them if available. If it finds no
relevant unexpired data and the Recursion Desired flag is not set in the
request, it should immediately return the response without consulting
the cache for expired records. Typically, this response would be a
referral to authoritative nameservers covering the zone, but the
specifics are implementation dependent.[¶](#section-5-6){.pilcrow}

If iterative lookups will be done, then the failure recheck timer is
consulted. Attempts to refresh from non-responsive or otherwise failing
authoritative nameservers are recommended to be done no more frequently
than every 30 seconds. If this request was received within this period,
the cache may be immediately consulted for stale data to satisfy the
request.[¶](#section-5-7){.pilcrow}

Outside the period of the failure recheck timer, the resolver should
start the query resolution timer and begin the iterative resolution
process. This timer bounds the work done by the resolver when contacting
external authorities and is commonly around 10 to 30 seconds. If this
timer expires on an attempted lookup that is still being processed, the
resolution effort is abandoned.[¶](#section-5-8){.pilcrow}

If the answer has not been completely determined by the time the client
response timer has elapsed, the resolver should then check its cache to
see whether there is expired data that would satisfy the request. If so,
it adds that data to the response message with a TTL greater than 0 (as
specified in [Section 4](#standards-action){.xref}). The response is
then sent to the client while the resolver continues its attempt to
refresh the data.[¶](#section-5-9){.pilcrow}

When no authorities are able to be reached during a resolution attempt,
the resolver should attempt to refresh the delegation and restart the
iterative lookup process with the remaining time on the query resolution
timer. This resumption should be done only once per resolution
effort.[¶](#section-5-10){.pilcrow}

Outside the resolution process, the maximum stale timer is used for
cache management and is independent of the query resolution process.
This timer is conceptually different from the maximum cache TTL that
exists in many resolvers, the latter being a clamp on the value of TTLs
as received from authoritative servers and recommended to be 7 days in
the TTL definition in [Section 4](#standards-action){.xref}. The maximum
stale timer should be configurable. It defines the length of time after
a record expires that it should be retained in the cache. The suggested
value is between 1 and 3 days.[¶](#section-5-11){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-6 .section}
## [6.](#section-6){.section-number .selfRef} [Implementation Considerations](#name-implementation-consideratio){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-implementation-consideratio}

This document mainly describes the issues behind serving stale data and
intentionally does not provide a formal algorithm. The concept is not
overly complex, and the details are best left to resolver authors to
implement in their codebases. The processing of serve-stale is a local
operation, and consistent variables between deployments are not needed
for interoperability. However, we would like to highlight the impact of
various implementation choices, starting with the timers
involved.[¶](#section-6-1){.pilcrow}

The most obvious of these is the maximum stale timer. If this variable
is too large, it could cause excessive cache memory usage, but if it is
too small, the serve-stale technique becomes less effective, as the
record may not be in the cache to be used if needed. Shorter values,
even less than a day, can effectively handle the vast majority of
outages. Longer values, as much as a week, give time for monitoring
systems to notice a resolution problem and for human intervention to fix
it; operational experience has been that sometimes the right people can
be hard to track down and unfortunately slow to remedy the
situation.[¶](#section-6-2){.pilcrow}

Increased memory consumption could be mitigated by prioritizing removal
of stale records over non-expired records during cache exhaustion.
Eviction strategies could consider additional factors, including the
last time of use or the popularity of a record, to retain active but
stale records. A feature to manually flush only stale records could also
be useful.[¶](#section-6-3){.pilcrow}

The client response timer is another variable that deserves
consideration. If this value is too short, there exists the risk that
stale answers may be used even when the authoritative server is actually
reachable but slow; this may result in undesirable answers being
returned. Conversely, waiting too long will negatively impact user
experience.[¶](#section-6-4){.pilcrow}

The balance for the failure recheck timer is responsiveness in detecting
the renewed availability of authorities versus the extra resource use
for resolution. If this variable is set too large, stale answers may
continue to be returned even after the authoritative server is
reachable; per \[[RFC2308](#RFC2308){.xref}\], [Section
7](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2308#section-7){.relref}, this
should be no more than 5 minutes. If this variable is too small,
authoritative servers may be targeted with a significant amount of
excess traffic.[¶](#section-6-5){.pilcrow}

Regarding the TTL to set on stale records in the response, historically
TTLs of 0 seconds have been problematic for some implementations, and
negative values can\'t effectively be communicated to existing software.
Other very short TTLs could lead to congestive collapse as
TTL-respecting clients rapidly try to refresh. The recommended value of
30 seconds not only sidesteps those potential problems with no practical
negative consequences, it also rate-limits further queries from any
client that honors the TTL, such as a forwarding
resolver.[¶](#section-6-6){.pilcrow}

As for the change to treat a TTL with the high-order bit set as positive
and then clamping it, as opposed to \[[RFC2181](#RFC2181){.xref}\]
treating it as zero, the rationale here is basically one of engineering
simplicity versus an inconsequential operational history. Negative TTLs
had no rational intentional meaning that wouldn\'t have been satisfied
by just sending 0 instead, and similarly there was realistically no
practical purpose for sending TTLs of 2\^25 seconds (1 year) or more.
There\'s also no record of TTLs in the wild having the most significant
bit set in the DNS Operations, Analysis, and Research Center\'s
(DNS-OARC\'s) \"Day in the Life\" samples \[[DITL](#DITL){.xref}\]. With
no apparent reason for operators to use them intentionally, that leaves
either errors or non-standard experiments as explanations as to why such
TTLs might be encountered, with neither providing an obviously
compelling reason as to why having the leading bit set should be treated
differently from having any of the next eleven bits set and then capped
per [Section 4](#standards-action){.xref}.[¶](#section-6-7){.pilcrow}

Another implementation consideration is the use of stale nameserver
addresses for lookups. This is mentioned explicitly because, in some
resolvers, getting the addresses for nameservers is a separate path from
a normal cache lookup. If authoritative server addresses are not able to
be refreshed, resolution can possibly still be successful if the
authoritative servers themselves are up. For instance, consider an
attack on a top-level domain that takes its nameservers offline;
serve-stale resolvers that had expired glue addresses for subdomains
within that top-level domain would still be able to resolve names within
those subdomains, even those it had not previously looked
up.[¶](#section-6-8){.pilcrow}

The directive in [Section 4](#standards-action){.xref} that only NoError
and NXDomain responses should invalidate any previously associated
answer stems from the fact that no other RCODEs that a resolver normally
encounters make any assertions regarding the name in the question or any
data associated with it. This comports with existing resolver behavior
where a failed lookup (say, during prefetching) doesn\'t impact the
existing cache state. Some authoritative server operators have said that
they would prefer stale answers to be used in the event that their
servers are responding with errors like ServFail instead of giving true
authoritative answers. Implementers [MAY]{.bcp14} decide to return stale
answers in this situation.[¶](#section-6-9){.pilcrow}

Since the goal of serve-stale is to provide resiliency for all obvious
errors to refresh data, these other RCODEs are treated as though they
are equivalent to not getting an authoritative response. Although
NXDomain for a previously existing name might well be an error, it is
not handled that way because there is no effective way to distinguish
operator intent for legitimate cases versus error
cases.[¶](#section-6-10){.pilcrow}

During discussion in the IETF, it was suggested that, if all authorities
return responses with an RCODE of Refused, it may be an explicit signal
to take down the zone from servers that still have the zone\'s
delegation pointed to them. Refused, however, is also overloaded to mean
multiple possible failures that could represent transient configuration
failures. Operational experience has shown that purposely returning
Refused is a poor way to achieve an explicit takedown of a zone compared
to either updating the delegation or returning NXDomain with a suitable
SOA for extended negative caching. Implementers [MAY]{.bcp14}
nonetheless consider whether to treat all authorities returning Refused
as preempting the use of stale data.[¶](#section-6-11){.pilcrow}

## [7.](#section-7){.section-number .selfRef} [Implementation Caveats](#name-implementation-caveats){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-implementation-caveats}

Stale data is used only when refreshing has failed in order to adhere to
the original intent of the design of the DNS and the behavior expected
by operators. If stale data were to always be used immediately and then
a cache refresh attempted after the client response has been sent, the
resolver would frequently be sending data that it would have had no
trouble refreshing. Because modern resolvers use techniques like
prefetching and request coalescing for efficiency, it is not necessary
that every client request needs to trigger a new lookup flow in the
presence of stale data, but rather that a good-faith effort has been
recently made to refresh the stale data before it is delivered to any
client.[¶](#section-7-1){.pilcrow}

It is important to continue the resolution attempt after the stale
response has been sent, until the query resolution timeout, because some
pathological resolutions can take many seconds to succeed as they cope
with unavailable servers, bad networks, and other problems. Stopping the
resolution attempt when the response with expired data has been sent
would mean that answers in these pathological cases would never be
refreshed.[¶](#section-7-2){.pilcrow}

The continuing prohibition against using data with a 0-second TTL beyond
the current transaction explicitly extends to it being unusable even for
stale fallback, as it is not to be cached at
all.[¶](#section-7-3){.pilcrow}

Be aware that Canonical Name (CNAME) and DNAME records
\[[RFC6672](#RFC6672){.xref}\] mingled in the expired cache with other
records at the same owner name can cause surprising results. This was
observed with an initial implementation in BIND when a hostname changed
from having an IPv4 Address (A) record to a CNAME. The version of BIND
being used did not evict other types in the cache when a CNAME was
received, which in normal operations is not a significant issue.
However, after both records expired and the authorities became
unavailable, the fallback to stale answers returned the older A instead
of the newer CNAME.[¶](#section-7-4){.pilcrow}

The algorithm described in [Section 5](#example-method){.xref} was
originally implemented as a patch to BIND 9.7.0. It has been in use on
Akamai\'s production network since 2011; it effectively smoothed over
transient failures and longer outages that would have resulted in major
incidents. The patch was contributed to the Internet Systems Consortium,
and the functionality is now available in BIND 9.12 and later via the
options stale-answer-enable, stale-answer-ttl, and
max-stale-ttl.[¶](#section-8-1){.pilcrow}

Unbound has a similar feature for serving stale answers and will respond
with stale data immediately if it has recently tried and failed to
refresh the answer by prefetching. Starting from version 1.10.0, Unbound
can also be configured to follow the algorithm described in [Section
5](#example-method){.xref}. Both behaviors can be configured and
fine-tuned with the available serve-expired-\*
options.[¶](#section-8-2){.pilcrow}

Knot Resolver has a demo module here:
\<<https://knot-resolver.readthedocs.io/en/stable/modules-serve_stale.html>\>.[¶](#section-8-3){.pilcrow}

Apple\'s system resolvers are also known to use stale answers, but the
details are not readily available.[¶](#section-8-4){.pilcrow}

In the research paper \"When the Dike Breaks: Dissecting DNS Defenses
During DDoS\" \[[DikeBreaks](#DikeBreaks){.xref}\], the authors detected
some use of stale answers by resolvers when authorities came under
attack. Their research results suggest that more widespread adoption of
the technique would significantly improve resiliency for the large
number of requests that fail or experience abnormally long resolution
times during an attack.[¶](#section-8-5){.pilcrow}

## [9.](#section-9){.section-number .selfRef} [EDNS Option](#name-edns-option){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-edns-option}

During the discussion of serve-stale in the IETF, it was suggested that
an EDNS option \[[RFC6891](#RFC6891){.xref}\] should be available. One
proposal was to use it to opt in to getting data that is possibly stale,
and another was to signal when stale data has been used for a
response.[¶](#section-9-1){.pilcrow}

The opt-in use case was rejected, as the technique was meant to be
immediately useful in improving DNS resiliency for all
clients.[¶](#section-9-2){.pilcrow}

The reporting case was ultimately also rejected because even the simpler
version of a proposed option was still too much bother to implement for
too little perceived value.[¶](#section-9-3){.pilcrow}

## [10.](#section-10){.section-number .selfRef} [Security Considerations](#name-security-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-security-considerations}

The most obvious security issue is the increased likelihood of DNSSEC
validation failures when using stale data because signatures could be
returned outside their validity period. Stale negative records can
increase the time window where newly published TLSA or DS RRs may not be
used due to cached NSEC or NSEC3 records. These scenarios would only be
an issue if the authoritative servers are unreachable (the only time the
techniques in this document are used), and thus serve-stale does not
introduce a new failure in place of what would have otherwise been
success.[¶](#section-10-1){.pilcrow}

Additionally, bad actors have been known to use DNS caches to keep
records alive even after their authorities have gone away. The
serve-stale feature potentially makes the attack easier, although
without introducing a new risk. In addition, attackers could combine
this with a DDoS attack on authoritative servers with the explicit
intent of having stale information cached for a longer period of time.
But if attackers have this capacity, they probably could do much worse
than prolonging the life of old data.[¶](#section-10-2){.pilcrow}

In \[[CloudStrife](#CloudStrife){.xref}\], it was demonstrated how stale
DNS data, namely hostnames pointing to addresses that are no longer in
use by the owner of the name, can be used to co-opt security \-- for
example, to get domain-validated certificates fraudulently issued to an
attacker. While this document does not create a new vulnerability in
this area, it does potentially enlarge the window in which such an
attack could be made. A proposed mitigation is that certificate
authorities should fully look up each name starting at the DNS root for
every name lookup. Alternatively, certificate authorities should use a
resolver that is not serving stale data.[¶](#section-10-3){.pilcrow}
