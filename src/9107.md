# BGP Optimal Route Reflection (BGP ORR) {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

This document defines an extension to BGP route reflectors. On route
reflectors, BGP route selection is modified in order to choose the best
route from the standpoint of their clients, rather than from the
standpoint of the route reflectors themselves. Depending on the scaling
and precision requirements, route selection can be specific for one
client, common for a set of clients, or common for all clients of a
route reflector. This solution is particularly applicable in deployments
using centralized route reflectors, where choosing the best route based
on the route reflector\'s IGP location is suboptimal. This facilitates,
for example, a \"best exit point\" policy (\"hot potato
routing\").[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

The solution relies upon all route reflectors learning all paths that
are eligible for consideration. BGP route selection is performed in the
route reflectors based on the IGP cost from configured locations in the
link-state IGP.[¶](#section-abstract-2){.pilcrow}

There are three types of BGP deployments within Autonomous Systems
(ASes) today: full mesh, confederations, and route reflection. BGP route
reflection \[[RFC4456](#RFC4456){.xref}\] is the most popular way to
distribute BGP routes between BGP speakers belonging to the same AS.
However, in some situations, this method suffers from non-optimal path
selection.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC4456](#RFC4456){.xref}\] asserts that, because the IGP cost to a
given point in the network will vary across routers, \"the route
reflection approach may not yield the same route selection result as
that of the full IBGP mesh approach.\" (\"IBGP\" stands for \"Internal
BGP\".) One practical implication of this fact is that the deployment of
route reflection may thwart the ability to achieve \"hot potato
routing\". Hot potato routing attempts to direct traffic to the closest
AS exit point in cases where no higher-priority policy dictates
otherwise. As a consequence of the route reflection method, the choice
of exit point for a route reflector and its clients will be the exit
point that is optimal for the route reflector \-- not necessarily the
one that is optimal for its clients.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

[Section 11](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4456#section-11){.relref}
of \[[RFC4456](#RFC4456){.xref}\] describes a deployment approach and a
set of constraints that, if satisfied, would result in the deployment of
route reflection yielding the same results as the IBGP full mesh
approach. This deployment approach makes route reflection compatible
with the application of a hot potato routing policy. In accordance with
these design rules, route reflectors have often been deployed in the
forwarding path and carefully placed on the boundaries between the Point
of Presence (POP) and the network core.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

The evolving model of intra-domain network design has enabled
deployments of route reflectors outside the forwarding path. Initially,
this model was only employed for new services, e.g., IP VPNs
\[[RFC4364](#RFC4364){.xref}\]; however, it has been gradually extended
to other BGP services, including the IPv4 and IPv6 Internet. In such
environments, a hot potato routing policy remains
desirable.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

Route reflectors outside the forwarding path can be placed on the
boundaries between the POP and the network core, but they are often
placed in arbitrary locations in the core of large
networks.[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}

Such deployments suffer from a critical drawback in the context of BGP
route selection: a route reflector with knowledge of multiple paths for
a given route will typically pick its best path and only advertise that
best path to its clients. If the best path for a route is selected on
the basis of an IGP tie-break, the path advertised will be the exit
point closest to the route reflector. However, the clients are in a
different place in the network topology than the route reflector. In
networks where the route reflectors are not in the forwarding path, this
difference will be even more acute.[¶](#section-1-6){.pilcrow}

In addition, there are deployment scenarios where service providers want
to have more control in choosing the exit points for clients based on
other factors, such as traffic type, traffic load, etc. This further
complicates the issue and makes it less likely for the route reflector
to select the best path from the client\'s perspective. It follows that
the best path chosen by the route reflector is not necessarily the same
as the path that would have been chosen by the client if the client had
considered the same set of candidate paths as the route
reflector.[¶](#section-1-7){.pilcrow}

The core of this solution is the ability for an operator to specify the
IGP location for which the route reflector calculates interior cost to
the next hop. The IGP location is defined as a node in the IGP topology,
it is identified by an IP address of this node (e.g., a loopback
address), and it may be configured on a per-route-reflector basis, per
set of clients, or on a per-client basis. Such configuration will allow
the route reflector to select and distribute to a given set of clients
routes with the shortest distance to the next hops from the position of
the selected IGP location. This provides for freedom related to the
route reflector\'s physical location and allows transient or permanent
migration of this network control plane function to an arbitrary
location with no impact on IP transit.[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

The choice of specific granularity (route reflector, set of clients, or
client) is configured by the network operator. An implementation is
considered compliant with this document if it supports at least one such
grouping category.[¶](#section-3-2){.pilcrow}

For purposes of route selection, the perspective of a client can differ
from that of a route reflector or another client in two distinct
ways:[¶](#section-3-3){.pilcrow}

-   [It has a different position in the IGP
    topology.[¶](#section-3-4.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-4.1}
-   [It can have a different routing
    policy.[¶](#section-3-4.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-4.2}

These factors correspond to the issues described
earlier.[¶](#section-3-5){.pilcrow}

This document defines, for BGP route reflectors
\[[RFC4456](#RFC4456){.xref}\], two changes to the BGP route selection
algorithm:[¶](#section-3-6){.pilcrow}

-   [The first change, introduced in [Section
    3.1](#sec_IGP_cost){.xref}, is related to the IGP cost to the BGP
    next hop in the BGP Decision Process. The change consists of using
    the IGP cost from a different IGP location than the route reflector
    itself.[¶](#section-3-7.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-7.1}
-   [The second change, introduced in [Section
    3.2](#sec_multiple){.xref}, is to extend the granularity of the BGP
    Decision Process, to allow for running multiple Decision Processes
    using different perspectives or
    policies.[¶](#section-3-7.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-7.2}

A route reflector can implement either or both of the modifications in
order to allow it to choose the best path for its clients that the
clients themselves would have chosen given the same set of candidate
paths.[¶](#section-3-8){.pilcrow}

A significant advantage of these approaches is that the route
reflector\'s clients do not need to be
modified.[¶](#section-3-9){.pilcrow}

### [3.1.](#section-3.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Route Selection from a Different IGP Location](#name-route-selection-from-a-diff){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-route-selection-from-a-diff}

In this approach, \"optimal\" refers to the decision where the interior
cost of a route is determined during step e) of
Section [9.1.2.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4271#section-9.1.2.2){.relref}
([\"Breaking Ties (Phase
2)\"](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4271#section-9.1.2.2){.relref})
of \[[RFC4271](#RFC4271){.xref}\]. It does not apply to path selection
preference based on other policy steps and
provisions.[¶](#section-3.1-1){.pilcrow}

In addition to the change specified in [Section
9](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4456#section-9){.relref} of
\[[RFC4456](#RFC4456){.xref}\], the text in step e) in [Section
9.1.2.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4271#section-9.1.2.2){.relref}
of \[[RFC4271](#RFC4271){.xref}\] is modified as
follows.[¶](#section-3.1-2){.pilcrow}

RFC 4271 reads:[¶](#section-3.1-3){.pilcrow}

> :   Remove from consideration any routes with less-preferred interior
>     cost. The interior cost of a route is determined by calculating

This document modifies this text to read:[¶](#section-3.1-5){.pilcrow}

> []{.break}
>
> e\)
> :   Remove from consideration any routes with less-preferred interior
>     cost. The interior cost of a route is determined by calculating

>     route using the shortest IGP path tree rooted at the selected IGP
>     location.[¶](#section-3.1-6.1.2){.pilcrow}
> :   

In order to be able to compute the shortest path tree rooted at the
selected IGP locations, knowledge of the IGP topology for the area/level
that includes each of those locations is needed. This knowledge can be
gained with the use of the link-state IGP, such as IS-IS
\[[ISO10589](#ISO10589){.xref}\] or OSPF \[[RFC2328](#RFC2328){.xref}\]
\[[RFC5340](#RFC5340){.xref}\], or via the Border Gateway Protocol -
Link State (BGP-LS) \[[RFC7752](#RFC7752){.xref}\]. When specifying the
logical location of a route reflector for a group of clients, one or
more backup IGP locations [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be allowed to be specified
for redundancy. Further deployment considerations are discussed in
[Section 4](#deployment-cons){.xref}.[¶](#section-3.1-7){.pilcrow}

In situations where the BGP next hop is a BGP route itself, the IGP
metric of a route used for its resolution [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be the final
IGP cost to reach such a next hop. Implementations that cannot inform
BGP of the final IGP metric to a recursive next hop [MUST]{.bcp14} treat
such paths as least preferred during next-hop metric comparisons.
However, such paths [MUST]{.bcp14} still be considered valid for BGP

### [3.2.](#section-3.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Multiple Route Selections](#name-multiple-route-selections){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-multiple-route-selections}

A BGP route reflector as per \[[RFC4456](#RFC4456){.xref}\] runs a
single BGP Decision Process. BGP Optimal Route Reflection (BGP ORR) may
require multiple BGP Decision Processes or subsets of the Decision
Process in order to consider different IGP locations or BGP policies for
different sets of clients. This is very similar to what is defined in
\[[RFC7947](#RFC7947){.xref}\], [Section
2.3.2.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7947#section-2.3.2.1){.relref}.[¶](#section-3.2-1){.pilcrow}

If the required routing optimization is limited to the IGP cost to the
BGP next hop, only step e) and subsequent steps as defined in
\[[RFC4271](#RFC4271){.xref}\], [Section
9.1.2.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4271#section-9.1.2.2){.relref}
need to be run multiple times.[¶](#section-3.2-2){.pilcrow}

If the routing optimization requires the use of different BGP policies
for different sets of clients, a larger part of the Decision Process
needs to be run multiple times, up to the whole Decision Process as
defined in [Section
9.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4271#section-9.1){.relref} of
\[[RFC4271](#RFC4271){.xref}\]. This is, for example, the case when
there is a need to use different policies to compute different degrees
of preference during Phase 1. This is needed for use cases involving
traffic engineering or dedicating certain exit points for certain
clients. In the latter case, the user may specify and apply a general
policy on the route reflector for a set of clients. Regular path
selection, including IGP perspectives for a set of clients as per
[Section 3.1](#sec_IGP_cost){.xref}, is then applied to the candidate
paths to select the final paths to advertise to the
clients.[¶](#section-3.2-3){.pilcrow}

## [4.](#section-4){.section-number .selfRef} [Deployment Considerations](#name-deployment-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-deployment-considerations}

BGP ORR provides a model for integrating the client\'s perspective into
the BGP route selection Decision Process for route reflectors. More
specifically, the choice of BGP path takes into account either the IGP
cost between the client and the next hop (rather than the IGP cost from
the route reflector to the next hop) or other user-configured
policies.[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

The achievement of optimal routing between clients of different clusters
relies upon all route reflectors learning all paths that are eligible
for consideration. In order to satisfy this requirement, BGP ADD-PATH
\[[RFC7911](#RFC7911){.xref}\] needs to be deployed between route
reflectors.[¶](#section-4-2){.pilcrow}

This solution can be deployed in hop-by-hop forwarding networks as well
as in end-to-end tunneled environments. To avoid routing loops in
networks with multiple route reflectors and hop-by-hop forwarding
without encapsulation, it is essential that the network topology be
carefully considered in designing a route reflection topology (see also
[Section 11](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4456#section-11){.relref}
of \[[RFC4456](#RFC4456){.xref}\]).[¶](#section-4-3){.pilcrow}

As discussed in [Section
11](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4456#section-11){.relref} of
\[[RFC4456](#RFC4456){.xref}\], the IGP locations of BGP route
reflectors are important and have routing implications. This equally
applies to the choice of the IGP locations configured on optimal route
reflectors. If a backup location is provided, it is used when the
primary IGP location disappears from the IGP (i.e., fails). Just like
the failure of a route reflector \[[RFC4456](#RFC4456){.xref}\], it may
result in changing the paths selected and advertised to the clients, and
in general, the post-failure paths are expected to be less optimal. This
is dependent on the IGP topologies and the IGP distance between the
primary and backup IGP locations: the smaller the distance, the smaller
the potential impact.[¶](#section-4-4){.pilcrow}

After selecting N suitable IGP locations, an operator can choose to
enable route selection for all of them on all or on a subset of their
route reflectors. The operator may alternatively deploy single or
multiple (backup case) route reflectors for each IGP location or create
any design in between. This choice may depend on the operational model
(centralized vs. per region), an acceptable blast radius in the case of
failure, an acceptable number of IBGP sessions for the mesh between the
route reflectors, performance, and configuration granularity of the
equipment.[¶](#section-4-5){.pilcrow}

With this approach, an ISP can effect a hot potato routing policy even
if route reflection has been moved out of the forwarding plane and
hop-by-hop forwarding has been replaced by end-to-end MPLS or IP
encapsulation. Compared with a deployment of ADD-PATH on all routers,
BGP ORR reduces the amount of state that needs to be pushed to the edge
of the network in order to perform hot potato
routing.[¶](#section-4-6){.pilcrow}

Modifying the IGP location of BGP ORR does not interfere with policies
enforced before IGP tie-breaking (step e) of
\[[RFC4271](#RFC4271){.xref}\], [Section
9.1.2.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4271#section-9.1.2.2){.relref})
in the BGP Decision Process.[¶](#section-4-7){.pilcrow}

Calculating routes for different IGP locations requires multiple
Shortest Path First (SPF) calculations and multiple (subsets of) BGP
Decision Processes. This scenario calls for more computing resources.
This document allows for different granularity, such as one Decision
Process per route reflector, per set of clients, or per client. A more
fine-grained granularity may translate into more optimal hot potato
routing at the cost of more computing power. Choosing to configure an
IGP location per client has the highest precision, as each client can be
associated with their ideal (own) IGP location. However, doing so may
have an impact on performance (as explained above). Using an IGP
location per set of clients implies a loss of precision but reduces the
impact on the performance of the route reflector. Similarly, if an IGP
location is selected for the whole routing instance, the lowest
precision is achieved, but the impact on performance is minimal. In the
last mode of operation (where an IGP location is selected for the whole
routing instance), both precision and performance metrics are equal to
route reflection as described in \[[RFC4456](#RFC4456){.xref}\]. The
ability to run fine-grained computations depends on the
platform/hardware deployed, the number of clients, the number of BGP
routes, and the size of the IGP topology. In essence, sizing
considerations are similar to the deployments of BGP route
reflectors.[¶](#section-4-8){.pilcrow}
