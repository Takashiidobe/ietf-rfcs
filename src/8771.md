# RFC 8771 {#rfcnum}

# The Internationalized Deliberately Unreadable Network NOtation (I-DUNNO) {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

Domain Names were designed for humans, IP addresses were not. But more
than 30 years after the introduction of the DNS, a minority of mankind
persists in invading the realm of machine-to-machine communication by
reading, writing, misspelling, memorizing, permuting, and confusing IP
addresses. This memo describes the Internationalized Deliberately
Unreadable Network NOtation (\"I-DUNNO\"), a notation designed to
replace current textual representations of IP addresses with something
that is not only more concise but will also discourage this small, but
obviously important, subset of human
activity.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

In [Section
2.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc791#section-2.3){.relref} of
\[[RFC0791](#RFC0791){.xref}\], the original designers of the Internet
Protocol carefully defined names and addresses as separate quantities.
While they did not explicitly reserve names for human consumption and
addresses for machine use, they did consider the matter indirectly in
their philosophical communal statement: \"A name indicates what we
seek.\" This clearly indicates that names rather than addresses should
be of concern to humans.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

The specification of domain names in \[[RFC1034](#RFC1034){.xref}\], and
indeed the continuing enormous effort put into the Domain Name System,
reinforces the view that humans should use names and leave worrying
about addresses to the machines. RFC 1034 mentions \"users\" several
times, and even includes the word \"humans\", even though it is
positioned slightly unfortunately, though perfectly understandably, in a
context of \"annoying\" and \"can wreak havoc\" (see [Section
5.2.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1034#section-5.2.3){.relref} of
\[[RFC1034](#RFC1034){.xref}\]). Nevertheless, this is another clear
indication that domain names are made for human use, while IP addresses
are for machine use.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

Given this, and a long error-strewn history of human attempts to utilize
addresses directly, it is obviously desirable that humans should not
meddle with IP addresses. For that reason, it appears quite logical that
a human-readable (textual) representation of IP addresses was just very
vaguely specified in [Section
2.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1123#section-2.1){.relref} of
\[[RFC1123](#RFC1123){.xref}\]. Subsequently, a directed effort to
further discourage human use by making IP addresses more confusing was
introduced in \[[RFC1883](#RFC1883){.xref}\] (which was obsoleted by
\[[RFC8200](#RFC8200){.xref}\]), and additional options for human
puzzlement were offered in [Section
2.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4291#section-2.2){.relref} of
\[[RFC4291](#RFC4291){.xref}\]. These noble early attempts to hamper
efforts by humans to read, understand, or even spell IP addressing
schemes were unfortunately severely compromised in
\[[RFC5952](#RFC5952){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

In order to prevent further damage from human meddling with IP
addresses, there is a clear urgent need for an address notation that
replaces these \"Legacy Notations\", and efficiently discourages humans
from reading, modifying, or otherwise manipulating IP addresses.
Research in this area long ago recognized the potential in
ab\^H\^Hperusing the intricacies, inaccuracies, and chaotic disorder of
what humans are pleased to call a \"Cultural Technique\" (also known as
\"Script\"), and with a certain inexorable inevitability has focused of
late on the admirable confusion (and thus discouragement) potential of
\[[UNICODE](#UNICODE){.xref}\] as an address notation. In [Section
4](#confreq){.xref}, we introduce a framework of Confusion Levels as an
aid to the evaluation of the effectiveness of any Unicode-based scheme
in producing notation in a form designed to be resistant to ready
comprehension or, heaven forfend, mutation of the address, and so
effecting the desired confusion and
discouragement.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

The authors welcome \[[RFC8369](#RFC8369){.xref}\] as a major step in
the right direction. However, we have some reservations about the scheme
proposed therein:[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}

-   [Our analysis of the proposed scheme indicates that, while
    impressively concise, it fails to attain more than at best a Minimum
    Confusion Level in our
    classification.[¶](#section-1-6.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-6.1}
-   [Humans, especially younger ones, are becoming skilled at handling
    emoji. Over time, this will negatively impact the discouragement
    factor.[¶](#section-1-6.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-6.2}
-   [The proposed scheme is specific to IPv6; if a solution to this
    problem is to be in any way timely, it must, as a matter of the
    highest priority, address IPv4. After all, even taking the
    regrettable effects of RFC 5952 into account, IPv6 does at least
    remain inherently significantly more confusing and discouraging than
    IPv4.[¶](#section-1-6.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-6.3}

This document therefore specifies an alternative Unicode-based notation,
the Internationalized Deliberately Unreadable Network NOtation
(I-DUNNO). This notation addresses each of the concerns outlined
above:[¶](#section-1-7){.pilcrow}

-   [I-DUNNO can generate Minimum, Satisfactory, or Delightful levels of
    confusion.[¶](#section-1-8.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-8.1}
-   [As well as emoji, it takes advantage of other areas of Unicode
    confusion.[¶](#section-1-8.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-8.2}
-   [It can be used with IPv4 and IPv6
    addresses.[¶](#section-1-8.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-8.3}

We concede that I-DUNNO notation is markedly less concise than that of
RFC 8369. However, by permitting multiple code points in the
representation of a single address, I-DUNNO opens up the full spectrum
of Unicode-adjacent code point interaction. This is a significant factor
in allowing I-DUNNO to achieve higher levels of confusion. I-DUNNO also
requires no change to the current size of Unicode code points, and so
its chances of adoption and implementation are (slightly)
higher.[¶](#section-1-9){.pilcrow}

Note that the use of I-DUNNO in the reverse DNS system is currently out
of scope. The occasional human-induced absence of the magical
one-character sequence [U+002E]{.unicode} is believed to cause
sufficient disorder there.[¶](#section-1-10){.pilcrow}

Media Access Control (MAC) addresses are totally out of the
question.[¶](#section-1-11){.pilcrow}

### [3.1.](#section-3.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Forming I-DUNNO](#name-forming-i-dunno){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-forming-i-dunno}

In order to form an I-DUNNO based on the Legacy Notation of an IP
address, the following steps are performed:[¶](#section-3.1-1){.pilcrow}

1.  [The octets of the IP address are written as a bitstring in network
    byte order.[¶](#section-3.1-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.1-2.1}

2.  ::: {#section-3.1-2.2}
    Working from left to right, the bitstring (32 bits for IPv4; 128
    bits for IPv6) is used to generate a list of valid UTF-8 octet
    sequences. To allocate a single UTF-8
    sequence:[¶](#section-3.1-2.2.1){.pilcrow}

    a.  [Choose whether to generate a UTF-8 sequence of 1, 2, 3, or 4
        octets. The choice OUGHT TO be guided by the requirement to
        generate a satisfactory [Minimum Confusion
        Level](#minconf){.xref} ([Section 4.1](#minconf){.xref}) (not to
        be confused with the minimum [Satisfactory Confusion
        Level](#satconf){.xref} ([Section 4.2](#satconf){.xref})). Refer
        to the character number range in [Table 1](#UTF8){.xref} in
        order to identify which octet sequence lengths are valid for a
        given bitstring. For example, a 2-octet UTF-8 sequence requires
        the next 11 bits to have a value in the range
        0080-07ff.[¶](#section-3.1-2.2.2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.1-2.2.2.1}
    b.  [Allocate bits from the bitstring to fill the vacant positions
        \'x\' in the UTF-8 sequence (see [Table 1](#UTF8){.xref}) from
        left to
        right.[¶](#section-3.1-2.2.2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.1-2.2.2.2}
    c.  [UTF-8 sequences of 1, 2, 3, and 4 octets require 7, 11, 16, and
        21 bits, respectively, from the bitstring. Since the number of
        combinations of UTF-8 sequences accommodating exactly 32 or 128
        bits is limited, in sequences where the number of bits required
        does not exactly match the number of available bits, the final
        UTF-8 sequence [MUST]{.bcp14} be padded with additional bits
        once the available address bits are exhausted. The sequence may
        therefore require up to 20 bits of padding. The content of the
        padding [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be chosen to maximize the resulting
        Confusion
        Level.[¶](#section-3.1-2.2.2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.1-2.2.2.3}

chance that a future allocation to a useful, legible character will
reduce this capacity significantly. Worse, in the (unlikely, but not

-   [There is at least one UTF-8 octet sequence with a length greater
    than 1 ([U+04A4]{.unicode})
    .[¶](#section-5-8.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-5-8.1}
-   [There are two IDNA2008 DISALLOWED characters: []{.unicode} U+000C
    (for good reason!) and
    [U+04A4]{.unicode}.[¶](#section-5-8.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-5-8.2}
-   [There is one non-printable character
    (U+000C).[¶](#section-5-8.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-5-8.3}
-   [There are characters from two different Scripts (Latin and
    Cyrillic).[¶](#section-5-8.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-5-8.4}

Therefore, the example above constitutes valid I-DUNNO with a
Satisfactory Confusion Level. U+000C in particular has great potential
in environments where I-DUNNOs would be sent to
printers.[¶](#section-5-9){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-6 .section}
## [6.](#section-6){.section-number .selfRef} [IANA Considerations](#name-iana-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-iana-considerations}

If this work is standardized, IANA is kindly requested to revoke all
IPv4 and IPv6 address range allocations that do not allow for at least
one I-DUNNO of Delightful Confusion Level. IPv4 prefixes are more likely
to be affected, hence this can easily be marketed as an effort to foster
IPv6 deployment.[¶](#section-6-1){.pilcrow}

Furthermore, IANA is urged to expand the [Internet TLA
Registry](#RFC5513){.xref} \[[RFC5513](#RFC5513){.xref}\] to accommodate
Seven-Letter Acronyms (SLA) for obvious reasons, and register
\'I-DUNNO\'. For that purpose, [U+002D (\"-\", HYPHEN-MINUS)]{.unicode}
[SHALL]{.bcp14} be declared a Letter.[¶](#section-6-2){.pilcrow}
:::

::: {#section-7 .section}
## [7.](#section-7){.section-number .selfRef} [Security Considerations](#name-security-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-security-considerations}

I-DUNNO is not a security algorithm. Quite the contrary \-- many humans
are known to develop a strong feeling of insecurity when confronted with
I-DUNNO.[¶](#section-7-1){.pilcrow}

In the tradition of many other RFCs, the evaluation of other security
aspects of I-DUNNO is left as an exercise for the
reader.[¶](#section-7-2){.pilcrow}
