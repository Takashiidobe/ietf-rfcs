# RFC 8876 {#rfcnum}

# Non-interactive Emergency Calls {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

Use of the Internet for emergency calling is described in RFC 6443,
\'Framework for Emergency Calling Using Internet Multimedia\'. In some
cases of emergency calls, the transmission of application data is all
that is needed, and no interactive media channel is established: a
situation referred to as \'non-interactive emergency calls\', where,
unlike most emergency calls, there is no two-way interactive media such
as voice or video or text. This document describes use of a SIP MESSAGE
transaction that includes a container for the data based on the Common
Alerting Protocol (CAP). That type of emergency request does not
establish a session, distinguishing it from SIP INVITE, which does. Any
device that needs to initiate a request for emergency services without
an interactive media channel would use the mechanisms in this
document.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC6443](#RFC6443){.xref}\] describes how devices use the Internet to
place emergency calls and how Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs)
handle Internet multimedia emergency calls natively. The exchange of
multimedia traffic for emergency services involves a SIP session
establishment starting with a SIP INVITE that negotiates various
parameters for that session.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

In some cases, however, there is only application data to be conveyed
from the end devices to a PSAP or an intermediary. Examples of such
environments include sensors issuing alerts, and certain types of
medical monitors. These messages may be alerts to emergency authorities
and do not require establishment of a session. These types of
interactions are called \'non-interactive emergency calls\'. In this
document, we use the term \"call\" so that similarities between
non-interactive alerts and sessions with interactive media are more
obvious.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

Non-interactive emergency calls are similar to regular emergency calls
in the sense that they require the emergency indications, emergency call
routing functionality, and location. However, the communication
interaction will not lead to the exchange of interactive media, that is,
Real-Time Transport Protocol \[[RFC3550](#RFC3550){.xref}\] packets,
such as voice, video, or real-time text.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

The Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) \[[CAP](#CAP){.xref}\] is a format
for exchanging emergency alerts and public warnings. CAP is mainly used
for conveying alerts and warnings between authorities and from
authorities to the public. The scope of this document is conveying CAP
alerts from private devices to emergency service authorities, as a call
without any interactive media.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

This document describes a method of including a CAP alert in a SIP
transaction by defining it as a block of \"additional data\" as defined
in \[[RFC7852](#RFC7852){.xref}\]. The CAP alert is included either by
value (the CAP alert is in the body of the message, using a CID) or by
reference (the message includes a URI that, when dereferenced, returns
the CAP alert). The additional data mechanism is also used to send
alert-specific data beyond that available in the CAP alert. This
document also describes how a SIP MESSAGE \[[RFC3428](#RFC3428){.xref}\]
transaction can be used to send a non-interactive
call.[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}

1.  ::: {#section-3-2.1}
    Emergency alerts containing only data are targeted to an
    intermediary recipient responsible for evaluating the next steps.
    These steps could include:[¶](#section-3-2.1.1){.pilcrow}

2.  [Emergency alerts may be targeted to a service URN
    \[[RFC5031](#RFC5031){.xref}\] used for IP-based emergency calls
    where the recipient is not known to the originator. In this
    scenario, the alert may contain only data (e.g., a SIP MESSAGE with
    CAP content, a Geolocation header field, and one or more Call-Info
    header fields containing additional data
    \[[RFC7852](#RFC7852){.xref}\]).[¶](#section-3-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-2.2}

[Figure 1](#targeted){.xref} shows a deployment variant where a sensor
is pre-configured (using techniques outside the scope of this document)
to issue an alert to an aggregator that processes these messages and
performs whatever steps are necessary to appropriately react to the
alert. For example, a security firm may use different sensor inputs to
dispatch their security staff to a building they protect or to initiate
a third-party emergency call.[¶](#section-3-3){.pilcrow}

[Figure 1](#figure-1){.selfRef}: [Targeted Emergency Alert
Routing](#name-targeted-emergency-alert-ro){.selfRef}
:::

In [Figure 2](#location){.xref}, a scenario is shown where the alert is
routed using location information and a service URN. An emergency
services routing proxy (ESRP) may use LoST (a protocol defined by
\[[RFC5222](#RFC5222){.xref}\], which translates a location to a URI
used to route an emergency call) to determine the next-hop proxy to
route the alert message to. A possible receiver is a PSAP, and the
recipient of the alert may be a call taker. In the generic case, there
is very likely no prior relationship between the originator and the
receiver, e.g., a PSAP. For example, a PSAP is likely to receive and
accept alerts from entities it has no previous relationship with. This
scenario is similar to a classic voice emergency services call, and the
description in \[[RFC6881](#RFC6881){.xref}\] is applicable. In this use
case, the only difference between an emergency call and an emergency
non-interactive call is that the former uses INVITE, creates a session,
and negotiates one or more media streams, while the latter uses MESSAGE,
does not create a session, and does not have interactive
media.[¶](#section-3-5){.pilcrow}

### [4.1.](#section-4.1){.section-number .selfRef} [CAP Transport](#name-cap-transport){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-cap-transport}

This document addresses sending a CAP alert in a SIP MESSAGE transaction
for a non-interactive emergency call. Behavior with other transactions
is not defined.[¶](#section-4.1-1){.pilcrow}

The CAP alert is included in a SIP message as an additional data block
\[[RFC7852](#RFC7852){.xref}\]. Accordingly, it is conveyed in the SIP
message with a Call-Info header field with a purpose of
\"EmergencyCallData.cap\". The header field may contain a URI that is
used by the recipient (or in some cases, an intermediary) to obtain the
CAP alert. Alternatively, the Call-Info header field may contain a
Content-ID URL \[[RFC2392](#RFC2392){.xref}\] and the CAP alert included
in the body of the message. In the latter case, the CAP alert is located
in a MIME block of the type
\'application/emergencyCallData.cap+xml\'.[¶](#section-4.1-2){.pilcrow}

If the SIP server does not support the functionality required to fulfill
the request, then a 501 Not Implemented will be returned as specified in
\[[RFC3261](#RFC3261){.xref}\]. This is the appropriate response when a
User Agent Server (UAS) does not recognize the request method and is not
capable of supporting it for any user.[¶](#section-4.1-3){.pilcrow}

The 415 Unsupported Media Type error will be returned as specified in
\[[RFC3261](#RFC3261){.xref}\] if the SIP server is refusing to service
the request because the message body of the request is in a format not
supported by the server for the requested method. The server
[MUST]{.bcp14} return a list of acceptable formats using the Accept,
Accept-Encoding, or Accept-Language header fields, depending on the
specific problem with the content.[¶](#section-4.1-4){.pilcrow}

The usage of CAP [MUST]{.bcp14} conform to the specification provided
with \[[CAP](#CAP){.xref}\]. For usage with SIP, the following
additional requirements are imposed (where \"sender\" and \"author\" are
as defined in CAP and \"originator\" is the entity sending the CAP
alert, which may be different from the entity sending the SIP
MESSAGE):[¶](#section-4.2-1){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

sender:

:   The following restrictions and conditions apply to setting the value
    of the \<sender> element:[¶](#section-4.2-2.2.1){.pilcrow}

    -   [Originator is a SIP entity, Author indication irrelevant: When
        the alert was created by a SIP-based originator and it is not
        useful to be explicit about the author of the alert, then the
        \<sender> element [MUST]{.bcp14} be populated with the SIP URI
        of the user
        agent.[¶](#section-4.2-2.2.2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.2-2.2.2.1}
    -   [Originator is a non-SIP entity, Author indication irrelevant:
        When the alert was created by a non-SIP-based entity and the
        identity of this original sender is to be preserved, then this
        identity [MUST]{.bcp14} be placed into the \<sender> element. In
        this situation, it is not useful to be explicit about the author
        of the alert. The specific type of identity being used will
        depend on the technology used by the
        originator.[¶](#section-4.2-2.2.2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.2-2.2.2.2}
    -   [Author indication relevant: When the author is different from
        the originator of the message and this distinction should be
        preserved, then the \<sender> element [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} contain
        the SIP URI of the user
        agent.[¶](#section-4.2-2.2.2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.2-2.2.2.3}

:   

incidents:

:   The \<incidents> element [MUST]{.bcp14} be present. This incident
    identifier [MUST]{.bcp14} be chosen in such a way that it is unique
    for a given \<sender, expires, incidents> combination. Note that the
    \<expires> element is [OPTIONAL]{.bcp14} and might not be
    present.[¶](#section-4.2-2.4.1){.pilcrow}

:   

scope:

:   The value of the \<scope> element [MAY]{.bcp14} be set to
    \"Private\" if the alert is not meant for public consumption. The
    \<addresses> element is, however, not used by this specification
    since the message routing is performed by SIP and the respective
    address information is already available in other SIP header fields.
    Populating information twice into different parts of the message may
    lead to inconsistency.[¶](#section-4.2-2.6.1){.pilcrow}

:   

parameter:
:   The \<parameter> element [MAY]{.bcp14} contain additional
    information specific to the sender, conforming to the CAP alert
    syntax.[¶](#section-4.2-2.8){.pilcrow}
:   

area:
:   It is [RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14} to omit this element when constructing a
    message. If the CAP alert is given to the SIP entity to transport
    and it already contains an \<area> element, then the specified
    location information [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be copied into a PIDF-LO
    structure (the data format for location used by emergency calls on
    the Internet) referenced by the SIP \'Geolocation\' header field. If
    the CAP alert is being created by the SIP entity using a PIDF-LO
    structure referenced by \'geolocation\' to construct \<area>,
    implementers must be aware that \<area> is limited to a circle or
    polygon, and conversion of other shapes will be required. Points
    [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be converted to a circle with a radius equal to the
    uncertainty of the point. Arc-bands and ellipses [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be
    converted to polygons with similar coverage, and 3D locations
    [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be converted to 2D forms with similar
    coverage.[¶](#section-4.2-2.10){.pilcrow}

A non-interactive emergency call is sent using a SIP MESSAGE transaction
with a CAP URI or body part as described above in a manner similar to
how an emergency call with interactive media is sent, as described in
\[[RFC6881](#RFC6881){.xref}\]. The MESSAGE transaction does not create

This SIP extension creates a new response code defined as
follows:[¶](#section-5.1-1){.pilcrow}

-   [425 (Bad Alert
    Message)[¶](#section-5.1-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.1-2.1}

The 425 response code is a rejection of the request, indicating that it
was malformed enough that no reasonable emergency response to the alert
can be determined.[¶](#section-5.1-3){.pilcrow}

A SIP intermediary can also use this code to reject an alert it receives
from a User Agent (UA) when it detects that the provided alert is
malformed.[¶](#section-5.1-4){.pilcrow}

[Section 5.2](#error-header){.xref} describes an AlertMsg-Error header
field with more details about what was wrong with the alert message in
the request. This header field [MUST]{.bcp14} be included in the 425
response.[¶](#section-5.1-5){.pilcrow}

It is usually the case that emergency calls are not rejected if there is
any useful information that can be acted upon. It is only appropriate to
generate a 425 response when the responding entity has no other
information in the request that is usable by the
responder.[¶](#section-5.1-6){.pilcrow}

A 425 response code [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be sent in response to a request
that lacks an alert message (i.e., CAP data), as the user agent in that
case may not support this extension.[¶](#section-5.1-7){.pilcrow}

A 425 response is a final response within a transaction and [MUST
NOT]{.bcp14} terminate an existing dialog.[¶](#section-5.1-8){.pilcrow}

The AlertMsg-Error header field provides additional information about
what was wrong with the original request. In some cases, the provided

\[[RFC5234](#RFC5234){.xref}\]:[¶](#section-5.2-2){.pilcrow}

   error-code-text  = "message" EQUAL quoted-string ; from RFC 3261
```

[¶](#section-5.2-3){.pilcrow}
:::

HCOLON, SEMI, and EQUAL are defined in \[[RFC3261](#RFC3261){.xref}\].
DIGIT is defined in
\[[RFC5234](#RFC5234){.xref}\].[¶](#section-5.2-4){.pilcrow}

The AlertMsg-Error header field [MUST]{.bcp14} contain only one
ErrorValue to indicate what was wrong with the alert payload the
recipient determined was bad.[¶](#section-5.2-5){.pilcrow}

The ErrorValue contains a 3-digit error code indicating what was wrong
with the alert in the request. This error code has a corresponding
quoted error text string that is human readable. The text string is
[OPTIONAL]{.bcp14}, but [RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14} for human readability,
similar to the string phrase used for SIP response codes. The strings in
this document are recommendations and are not standardized \-- meaning
an operator can change the strings but [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} change the
meaning of the error code. The code space for ErrorValue is separate
from SIP Status Codes.[¶](#section-5.2-6){.pilcrow}

The AlertMsg-Error header field [MAY]{.bcp14} be included in any
response if an alert message was in the request part of the same
transaction. For example, suppose a UA includes an alert in a MESSAGE to
a PSAP. The PSAP can accept this MESSAGE, even though its UA determined
that the alert message contained in the MESSAGE was bad. The PSAP merely
includes an AlertMsg-Error header field value in the 200 OK to the
MESSAGE, thus informing the UA that the MESSAGE was accepted but the
alert provided was bad.[¶](#section-5.2-7){.pilcrow}

If, on the other hand, the PSAP cannot accept the transaction without a
suitable alert message, a 425 response is
sent.[¶](#section-5.2-8){.pilcrow}

A SIP intermediary that requires the UA\'s alert message in order to
properly process the transaction may also send a 425 response with an
AlertMsg-Error code.[¶](#section-5.2-9){.pilcrow}

This document defines an initial list of AlertMsg-Error values for any
SIP response, including provisional responses (other than 100 Trying)
and the new 425 response. There [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be more than one
AlertMsg-Error code in a SIP response. AlertMsg-Error values sent in
provisional responses [MUST]{.bcp14} be sent using the mechanism defined
in \[[RFC3262](#RFC3262){.xref}\]; or, if that mechanism is not
negotiated, they [MUST]{.bcp14} be repeated in the final response to the
transaction.[¶](#section-5.2-10){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-5.2-11}
``` sourcecode
AlertMsg-Error: 100 ; message="Cannot process the alert payload"

AlertMsg-Error: 101 ; message="Alert payload was not present or could

the purpose of the alert"

AlertMsg-Error: 103 ; message="Alert payload was corrupted"
```

Additionally, if an entity cannot or chooses not to process the alert
message from a SIP request, a 500 (Server Internal Error)
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} be used with or without a configurable Retry-After
header field.[¶](#section-5.2-12){.pilcrow}

Sensors may have large quantities of data that they may wish to send.
Including large amounts of data (tens of kilobytes) in a MESSAGE is not
advisable because SIP entities are usually not equipped to handle very
large messages. In such cases, the sender [SHOULD]{.bcp14} make use of
the by-reference mechanisms defined in \[[RFC7852](#RFC7852){.xref}\],
which involves making the data available via HTTPS
\[[RFC2818](#RFC2818){.xref}\] (either at the originator or at another
entity), placing a URI to the data in the \'Call-Info\' header field,
and the recipient uses HTTPS to retrieve the data. The CAP alert itself
can be sent by reference using this mechanism, as can any or all of the
additional data blocks that may contain sensor-specific
data.[¶](#section-7-1){.pilcrow}

There are no rate-limiting mechanisms for any SIP transactions that are
standardized, although implementations often include such functions.
Non-interactive emergency calls are typically handled the same as any
emergency call, which means a human call-taker is involved.
Implementations should take note of this limitation, especially when
calls are placed automatically without human
initiation.[¶](#section-7-2){.pilcrow}

## [9.](#section-9){.section-number .selfRef} [Security Considerations](#name-security-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-security-considerations}

This section discusses security considerations when SIP user agents
issue emergency alerts utilizing MESSAGE and CAP. Location-specific
threats are not unique to this document and are discussed in
\[[RFC7378](#RFC7378){.xref}\] and
\[[RFC6442](#RFC6442){.xref}\].[¶](#section-9-1){.pilcrow}

The Emergency Context Resolution with Internet Technologies (ECRIT)
emergency services architecture \[[RFC6443](#RFC6443){.xref}\] considers
classic individual-to-authority emergency calling where the identity of
the emergency caller does not play a role at the time of the call
establishment itself, i.e., a response to the emergency call does not
depend on the identity of the caller. In the case of emergency alerts
generated by devices such as sensors, the processing may be different in
order to reduce the number of falsely generated emergency alerts. Alerts
could get triggered based on certain sensor input that might have been
caused by factors other than the actual occurrence of an alert-relevant
event. For example, a sensor may simply be malfunctioning. For this
reason, not all alert messages are directly sent to a PSAP, but rather,
may be pre-processed by a separate entity, potentially under supervision
by a human, to filter alerts and potentially correlate received alerts
with others to obtain a larger picture of the ongoing
situation.[¶](#section-9-2){.pilcrow}

In any case, for alerts initiated by sensors, the identity could play an
important role in deciding whether to accept or ignore an incoming alert
message. With the scenario shown in [Figure 1](#targeted){.xref}, it is
very likely that only authenticated sensor input will be processed. For
this reason, it needs to be possible to refuse to accept alert messages
from unknown origins. Two types of information elements can be used for
this purpose:[¶](#section-9-3){.pilcrow}

1.  [SIP itself provides security mechanisms that allow the verification
    of the originator\'s identity, such as P-Asserted-Identity
    \[[RFC3325](#RFC3325){.xref}\] or SIP Identity
    \[[RFC8224](#RFC8224){.xref}\]. The latter provides a cryptographic
    assurance while the former relies on a chain-of-trust model. These
    mechanisms can be
    reused.[¶](#section-9-4.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-9-4.1}
2.  [CAP provides additional security mechanisms and the ability to
    carry further information about the sender\'s identity. Section
    3.3.4.1 of \[[CAP](#CAP){.xref}\] specifies the signing algorithms
    of CAP documents.[¶](#section-9-4.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-9-4.2}

The specific policy and mechanisms used in a given deployment are out of
scope for this document.[¶](#section-9-5){.pilcrow}

There is no rate limiting mechanisms in SIP, and all kinds of emergency
calls, including those defined in this document, could be used by
malicious actors or misbehaving devices to effect a denial-of-service
attack on the emergency services. The mechanism defined in this document
does not introduce any new considerations, although it may be more
likely that devices that place non-interactive emergency calls without a
human initiating them may be more likely than those that require a user
to initiate them.[¶](#section-9-6){.pilcrow}

Implementors should note that automated emergency calls may be
prohibited or regulated in some jurisdictions, and there may be
penalties for \"false positive\" calls.[¶](#section-9-7){.pilcrow}

This document describes potential retrieval of information by
dereferencing URIs found in a Call Info header of a SIP MESSAGE. These
may include a CAP alert as well as other additional data
\[[RFC7852](#RFC7852){.xref}\] blocks. The domain of the device sending
the SIP MESSAGE; the domain of the server holding the CAP alert, if sent
by reference; and the domain of other additional data blocks, if sent by
reference, may all be different. No assumptions can be made that there
are trust relationships between these entities. Recipients
[MUST]{.bcp14} take precautions in retrieving any additional data blocks
passed by reference, including the CAP alert, because the URI may point
to a malicious actor or entity not expecting to be referred to for this
purpose. The considerations in handling URIs in
\[[RFC3986](#RFC3986){.xref}\] apply.[¶](#section-9-8){.pilcrow}

Use of timestamps to prevent replay is subject to the availability of
accurate time at all participants. Because emergency event notification
via this mechanism is relatively low frequency and generally involves
human interaction, implementations may wish to consider messages with
times within a small number of seconds of each other to be effectively
simultaneous for the purposes of detecting replay. Implementations may
also wish to consider that most deployed time distribution protocols
likely to be used by these systems are not presently
secure.[¶](#section-9-9){.pilcrow}

In addition to the desire to perform identity-based access control, the
classic communication security threats need to be considered, including
integrity protection to prevent forgery or replay of alert messages in
transit. To deal with replay of alerts, a CAP document contains the
mandatory \<identifier>, \<sender>, and \<sent> elements and an optional
\<expire> element. Together, these elements make the CAP document unique
for a specific sender and provide time restrictions. An entity that has
already received a CAP alert within the indicated timeframe is able to
detect a replayed message and, if the content of that message is
unchanged, then no additional security vulnerability is created.
Additionally, it is [RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14} to make use of SIP security
mechanisms, such as the SIP Identity PASSporT
\[[RFC8225](#RFC8225){.xref}\], to tie the CAP alert to the SIP message.
To provide protection of the entire SIP message exchange between
neighboring SIP entities, the usage of TLS is [RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14}.
\[[RFC6443](#RFC6443){.xref}\] discusses the issues of using TLS with
emergency calls, which are equally applicable to non-interactive
emergency calls.[¶](#section-9-10){.pilcrow}

Note that none of the security mechanisms in this document protect
against a compromised sensor sending crafted alerts. Confidentiality
provided for any emergency calls, including non-interactive messages, is
subject to local regulations. Privacy issues are discussed in
\[[RFC7852](#RFC7852){.xref}\] and are applicable
here.[¶](#section-9-11){.pilcrow}
