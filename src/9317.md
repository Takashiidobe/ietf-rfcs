# Operational Considerations for Streaming Media {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

This document provides an overview of operational networking and
transport protocol issues that pertain to the quality of experience
(QoE) when streaming video and other high-bitrate media over the
Internet.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

This document explains the characteristics of streaming media delivery
that have surprised network designers or transport experts who lack
specific media expertise, since streaming media highlights key
differences between common assumptions in existing networking practices
and observations of media delivery issues encountered when streaming
media over those existing networks.[¶](#section-abstract-2){.pilcrow}

### [1.1.](#section-1.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Key Definitions](#name-key-definitions){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-key-definitions}

This document defines \"high-bitrate streaming media over the Internet\"
as follows:[¶](#section-1.1-1){.pilcrow}

-   [\"High-bitrate\" is a context-sensitive term broadly intended to
    capture rates that can be sustained over some but not all of the
    target audience\'s network connections. A snapshot of values
    commonly qualifying as high-bitrate on today\'s Internet is given by
    the higher-value entries in [Section 3.1.1](#bvr){.auto .internal
    .xref}.[¶](#section-1.1-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-1.1-2.1}

-   ::: {#section-1.1-2.2}
    \"Streaming\" means the continuous transmission of media segments
    from a server to a client and its simultaneous consumption by the
    client.[¶](#section-1.1-2.2.1){.pilcrow}

    -   [The term \"simultaneous\" is critical, as media segment
        transmission is not considered \"streaming\" if one downloads a
        media file and plays it after the download is completed.
        Instead, this would be called \"download and
        play\".[¶](#section-1.1-2.2.2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-1.1-2.2.2.1}
    -   [This has two implications. First, the sending rate for media
        segments must match the client\'s consumption rate (whether
        loosely or tightly) to provide uninterrupted playback. That is,
        the client must not run out of media segments (buffer underrun)
        and must not accept more media segments than it can buffer
        before playback (buffer
        overrun).[¶](#section-1.1-2.2.2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-1.1-2.2.2.2}
    -   [Second, the client\'s media segment consumption rate is limited
        not only by the path\'s available bandwidth but also by media
        segment availability. The client cannot fetch media segments
        that a media server cannot provide
        (yet).[¶](#section-1.1-2.2.2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-1.1-2.2.2.3}
    :::

-   [\"Media\" refers to any type of media and associated streams, such
    as video, audio, metadata,
    etc.[¶](#section-1.1-2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-1.1-2.3}

-   [\"Over the Internet\" means that a single operator does not have
    control of the entire path between media servers and media clients,
    so it is not a \"walled
    garden\".[¶](#section-1.1-2.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-1.1-2.4}

This document uses these terms to describe the streaming media
ecosystem:[¶](#section-1.1-3){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

Streaming Media Operator:

:   an entity that provides streaming media
    servers[¶](#section-1.1-4.2.1){.pilcrow}

:   

Media Server:

:   a server that provides streaming media to a media player, which is
    also referred to as a streaming media server, or simply a
    server[¶](#section-1.1-4.4.1){.pilcrow}

:   

Intermediary:

:   an entity that is on-path, between the streaming media operator and
    the ultimate media consumer, and that is media
    aware[¶](#section-1.1-4.6.1){.pilcrow}

    When the streaming media is encrypted, an intermediary must have
    credentials that allow the intermediary to decrypt the media in
    order to be media aware.[¶](#section-1.1-4.6.2){.pilcrow}

    An intermediary can be one of many specialized subtypes that meet
    this definition.[¶](#section-1.1-4.6.3){.pilcrow}

Media Player:

:   an endpoint that requests streaming media from a media server for an
    ultimate media consumer, which is also referred to as a streaming
    media client, or simply a client[¶](#section-1.1-4.8.1){.pilcrow}

### [1.2.](#section-1.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Document Scope](#name-document-scope){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-document-scope}

A full review of all streaming media considerations for all types of
media over all types of network paths is too broad a topic to cover
comprehensively in a single document.[¶](#section-1.2-1){.pilcrow}

This document focuses chiefly on the large-scale delivery of streaming
high-bitrate media to end users. It is primarily intended for those
controlling endpoints involved in delivering streaming media traffic.
This can include origin servers publishing content, intermediaries like
content delivery networks (CDNs), and providers for client devices and
media players.[¶](#section-1.2-2){.pilcrow}

Most of the considerations covered in this document apply to both \"live
media\" (created and streamed as an event is in progress) and \"media on
demand\" (previously recorded media that is streamed from storage),
except where noted.[¶](#section-1.2-3){.pilcrow}

Most of the considerations covered in this document apply to both media
that is consumed by a media player, for viewing by a human, and media
that is consumed by a machine, such as a media recorder that is
executing an adaptive bitrate (ABR) streaming algorithm, except where
noted.[¶](#section-1.2-4){.pilcrow}

This document contains[¶](#section-1.2-5){.pilcrow}

    2](#sd){.auto .internal .xref} to set the stage for the rest of the
    document,[¶](#section-1.2-6.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-1.2-6.1}
-   [general guidance on bandwidth provisioning ([Section
    3](#bwprov){.auto .internal .xref}) and latency considerations
    ([Section 4](#latency-cons){.auto .internal .xref}) for streaming
    media delivery,[¶](#section-1.2-6.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-1.2-6.2}
-   [a description of adaptive encoding and adaptive delivery techniques
    in common use for streaming video, along with a description of the
    challenges media senders face in detecting the bitrate available
    between the media sender and media receiver, and a collection of
    measurements by a third party for use in analytics ([Section
    5](#sec-abr){.auto .internal
    .xref}),[¶](#section-1.2-6.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-1.2-6.3}
-   [a description of existing transport protocols used for media
    streaming and the issues encountered when using those protocols,
    along with a description of the QUIC transport protocol
    \[[RFC9000](#RFC9000){.cite .xref}\] more recently used for
    streaming media ([Section 6](#sec-trans){.auto .internal
    .xref}),[¶](#section-1.2-6.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-1.2-6.4}
-   [a description of implications when streaming encrypted media
    ([Section 7](#stream-encrypt-media){.auto .internal .xref}),

    rapidly changing subject ([Section 8](#further){.auto .internal

Topics outside this scope include the
following:[¶](#section-1.2-7){.pilcrow}

-   [an in-depth examination of real-time, two-way interactive media,
    such as videoconferencing; although this document touches lightly on
    topics related to this space, the intent is to let readers know that
    for more in-depth coverage they should look to other documents,
    since the techniques and issues for interactive real-time, two-way
    media differ so dramatically from those in large-scale, one-way
    delivery of streaming
    media.[¶](#section-1.2-8.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-1.2-8.1}
-   [specific recommendations on operational practices to mitigate
    issues described in this document; although some known mitigations
    are mentioned in passing, the primary intent is to provide a point

As the Internet has grown, an increasingly large share of the traffic
delivered to end users has become video. The most recent available
estimates found that 75% of the total traffic to end users was video in
2019 (as described in \[[RFC8404](#RFC8404){.cite .xref}\], such traffic
surveys have since become impossible to conduct due to ubiquitous
encryption). At that time, the share of video traffic had been growing
for years and was projected to continue growing (Appendix D of
\[[CVNI](#CVNI){.cite .xref}\]).[¶](#section-2-1){.pilcrow}

A substantial part of this growth is due to the increased use of
streaming video. However, video traffic in real-time communications (for
example, online videoconferencing) has also grown significantly. While
both streaming video and videoconferencing have real-time delivery and
latency requirements, these requirements vary from one application to
another. For additional discussion of latency requirements, see [Section
4](#latency-cons){.auto .internal .xref}.[¶](#section-2-2){.pilcrow}

In many contexts, media traffic can be handled transparently as generic
application-level traffic. However, as the volume of media traffic
continues to grow, it is becoming increasingly important to consider the
effects of network design decisions on application-level performance,
with considerations for the impact on media
delivery.[¶](#section-2-3){.pilcrow}

Much of the focus of this document is on media streaming over HTTP. HTTP
is widely used for media streaming because[¶](#section-2-4){.pilcrow}

Various HTTP versions have been used for media delivery. HTTP/1.0,
HTTP/1.1, and HTTP/2 are carried over TCP \[[RFC9293](#RFC9293){.cite

QUIC, and QUIC\'s transport behavior is described in [Section

Video bitrate selection depends on many variables including the
resolution (height and width), frame rate, color depth, codec, encoding
parameters, scene complexity, and amount of motion. Generally speaking,
as the resolution, frame rate, color depth, scene complexity, and amount
of motion increase, the encoding bitrate increases. As newer codecs with
better compression tools are used, the encoding bitrate decreases.
Similarly, a multi-pass encoding generally produces better quality
output compared to single-pass encoding at the same bitrate or delivers
the same quality at a lower bitrate.[¶](#section-3.1.1-1){.pilcrow}

Here are a few common resolutions used for video content, with typical

The bitrates given in [Section 3.1.1](#bvr){.auto .internal .xref}
describe video streams that provide the user with a single, fixed point
of view \-- therefore, the user has no \"degrees of freedom\", and the
user sees all of the video image that is
available.[¶](#section-3.1.2-1){.pilcrow}

Even basic virtual reality (360-degree) videos that allow users to look
around freely (referred to as \"three degrees of freedom\" or 3DoF)
require substantially larger bitrates when they are captured and
encoded, as such videos require multiple fields of view of the scene.
Yet, due to smart delivery methods, such as viewport-based or tile-based
streaming, there is no need to send the whole scene to the user.
Instead, the user needs only the portion corresponding to its viewpoint
at any given time \[[Survey360](#Survey360){.cite
.xref}\].[¶](#section-3.1.2-2){.pilcrow}

In more immersive applications, where limited user movement (\"three
degrees of freedom plus\" or 3DoF+) or full user movement (\"six degrees
of freedom\" or 6DoF) is allowed, the required bitrate grows even
further. In this case, immersive content is typically referred to as
volumetric media. One way to represent the volumetric media is to use
point clouds, where streaming a single object may easily require a
bitrate of 30 Mbps or higher. Refer to \[[MPEGI](#MPEGI){.cite .xref}\]

### [3.2.](#section-3.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Path Bottlenecks and Constraints](#name-path-bottlenecks-and-constr){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-path-bottlenecks-and-constr}

Even when the bandwidth requirements for media streams along a path are
well understood, additional analysis is required to understand the
constraints on bandwidth at various points along the path between media
servers and media players. Media streams can encounter bottlenecks at
many points along a path, whether the bottleneck happens at a node or at
a path segment along the path, and these bottlenecks may involve a lack
of processing power, buffering capacity, link speed, or any other
exhaustible resource.[¶](#section-3.2-1){.pilcrow}

Media servers may react to bandwidth constraints using two independent
feedback loops:[¶](#section-3.2-2){.pilcrow}

-   [Media servers often respond to application-level feedback from the
    media player that indicates a bottleneck somewhere along the path by
    sending a different media bitrate. This is described in greater
    detail in [Section 5](#sec-abr){.auto .internal
    .xref}.[¶](#section-3.2-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.2-3.1}
-   [Media servers also typically rely on transport protocols with
    capacity-seeking congestion controllers that probe for available
    path bandwidth and adjust the media sending rate based on transport
    mechanisms. This is described in greater detail in [Section
    6](#sec-trans){.auto .internal
    .xref}.[¶](#section-3.2-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.2-3.2}

The result is that these two (potentially competing) \"helpful\"
mechanisms each respond to the same bottleneck with no coordination
between themselves, so that each is unaware of actions taken by the
other, and this can result in QoE for users that is significantly lower
than what could have been achieved.[¶](#section-3.2-4){.pilcrow}

One might wonder why media servers and transport protocols are each
unaware of what the other is doing, and there are multiple reasons for
that. One reason is that media servers are often implemented as
applications executing in user space, relying on a general-purpose
operating system that typically has its transport protocols implemented
in the operating system kernel, making decisions that the media server
never knows about.[¶](#section-3.2-5){.pilcrow}

As one example, if a media server overestimates the available bandwidth
to the media player,[¶](#section-3.2-6){.pilcrow}

-   [the transport protocol may detect loss due to congestion and reduce
    its sending window size per round
    trip,[¶](#section-3.2-7.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.2-7.1}
-   [the media server adapts to application-level feedback from the
    media player and reduces its own sending rate,
    and/or[¶](#section-3.2-7.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.2-7.2}
-   [the transport protocol sends media at the new, lower rate and
    confirms that this new, lower rate is \"safe\" because no
    transport-level loss is
    occurring.[¶](#section-3.2-7.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.2-7.3}

However, because the media server continues to send at the new, lower
rate, the transport protocol\'s maximum sending rate is now limited by
the amount of information the media server queues for transmission.
Therefore, the transport protocol cannot probe for available path
bandwidth by sending at a higher rate until the media player requests
segments that buffer enough data for the transport to perform the
probing.[¶](#section-3.2-8){.pilcrow}

To avoid these types of situations, which can potentially affect all the
users whose streaming media segments traverse a bottleneck path segment,
there are several possible mitigations that streaming operators can use.
However, the first step toward mitigating a problem is knowing that a
problem is occurring.[¶](#section-3.2-9){.pilcrow}

-   [If the path topology changes. For example, routing changes, which
    can happen in normal operation, may result in traffic being carried

    from the previous path, especially if the new path topology includes
    one or more path segments that are more heavily loaded, offer lower
    total bandwidth, change the overall Path MTU size, or simply cover
    more distance between the path

### [3.3.](#section-3.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Path Requirements](#name-path-requirements){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-path-requirements}

The bitrate requirements in [Section 3.1](#scaling){.auto .internal
.xref} are per end user actively consuming a media feed, so in the worst
case, the bitrate demands can be multiplied by the number of
simultaneous users to find the bandwidth requirements for a delivery
path with that number of users downstream. For example, at a node with
10,000 downstream users simultaneously consuming video streams,
approximately 80 Gbps might be necessary for all of them to get typical
content at 1080p resolution.[¶](#section-3.3-1){.pilcrow}

However, when there is some overlap in the feeds being consumed by end
users, it is sometimes possible to reduce the bandwidth provisioning
requirements for the network by performing some kind of replication
within the network. This can be achieved via object caching with the
delivery of replicated objects over individual connections and/or by
packet-level replication using multicast.[¶](#section-3.3-2){.pilcrow}

To the extent that replication of popular content can be performed,
bandwidth requirements at peering or ingest points can be reduced to as
low as a per-feed requirement instead of a per-user
requirement.[¶](#section-3.3-3){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-3.4 .section}
### [3.4.](#section-3.4){.section-number .selfRef} [Caching Systems](#name-caching-systems){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-caching-systems}

When demand for content is relatively predictable, and especially when
that content is relatively static, caching content close to requesters
and preloading caches to respond quickly to initial requests are often
useful (for example, HTTP/1.1 caching is described in
\[[RFC9111](#RFC9111){.cite .xref}\]). This is subject to the usual
considerations for caching \-- for example, how much data must be cached
to make a significant difference to the requester and how the benefit of
caching and preloading cache balances against the costs of tracking
stale content in caches and refreshing that
content.[¶](#section-3.4-1){.pilcrow}

It is worth noting that not all high-demand content is \"live\" content.
One relevant example is when popular streaming content can be staged
close to a significant number of requesters, as can happen when a new
episode of a popular show is released. This content may be largely
stable and is therefore low-cost to maintain in multiple places
throughout the Internet. This can reduce demands for high end-to-end
bandwidth without having to use mechanisms like
multicast.[¶](#section-3.4-2){.pilcrow}

Caching and preloading can also reduce exposure to peering point
congestion, since less traffic crosses the peering point exchanges if
the caches are placed in peer networks. This is especially true when the
content can be preloaded during off-peak hours and if the transfer can
make use of \"A Lower-Effort Per-Hop Behavior (LE PHB) for
Differentiated Services\" \[[RFC8622](#RFC8622){.cite .xref}\], \"Low
Extra Delay Background Transport (LEDBAT)\" \[[RFC6817](#RFC6817){.cite
.xref}\], or similar mechanisms.[¶](#section-3.4-3){.pilcrow}

All of this depends, of course, on the ability of a streaming media
operator to predict usage and provision bandwidth, caching, and other
mechanisms to meet the needs of users. In some cases ([Section
3.5](#sec-predict){.auto .internal .xref}), this is relatively routine,
but in other cases, it is more difficult ([Section
3.6](#sec-unpredict){.auto .internal
.xref}).[¶](#section-3.4-4){.pilcrow}

With the emergence of ultra-low-latency streaming, responses have to
start streaming to the end user while still being transmitted to the
cache and while the cache does not yet know the size of the object. Some
of the popular caching systems were designed around a cache footprint
and had deeply ingrained assumptions about knowing the size of objects
that are being stored, so the change in design requirements in
long-established systems caused some errors in production. Incidents
occurred where a transmission error in the connection from the upstream
source to the cache could result in the cache holding a truncated
segment and transmitting it to the end user\'s device. In this case,
players rendering the stream often had a playback freeze until the
player was reset. In some cases, the truncated object was even cached
that way and served later to other players as well, causing continued
stalls at the same spot in the media for all players playing the segment
delivered from that cache node.[¶](#section-3.4-5){.pilcrow}

Historical data shows that users consume more videos, and these videos
are encoded at a bitrate higher than they were in the past. Improvements
in the codecs that help reduce the encoding bitrates with better
compression algorithms have not offset the increase in the demand for
the higher quality video (higher resolution, higher frame rate, better
color gamut, better dynamic range, etc.). In particular, mobile data
usage in cellular access networks has shown a large jump over the years

\[[RFC5594](#RFC5594){.cite .xref}\], when the BitTorrent file sharing
application came into widespread use in 2005, sudden and unexpected
growth in peer-to-peer traffic led to complaints from ISP customers
about the performance of delay-sensitive traffic (Voice over IP (VoIP)
and gaming). These performance issues resulted from at least two
causes:[¶](#section-3.6.1-1){.pilcrow}

-   [Many access networks for end users used underlying technologies
    that are inherently asymmetric, favoring downstream bandwidth (e.g.,
    ADSL, cellular technologies, and most IEEE 802.11 variants),
    assuming that most users will need more downstream bandwidth than
    upstream bandwidth. This is a good assumption for client-server
    applications, such as streaming media or software downloads, but
    BitTorrent rewarded peers that uploaded as much as they downloaded,
    so BitTorrent users had much more symmetric usage profiles, which
    interacted badly with these asymmetric access network
    technologies.[¶](#section-3.6.1-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.6.1-2.1}
-   [Some P2P systems also used distributed hash tables to organize
    peers into a ring topology, where each peer knew its \"next peer\"
    and \"previous peer\". There was no connection between the
    application-level ring topology and the lower-level network
    topology, so a peer\'s \"next peer\" might be anywhere on the
    reachable Internet. Traffic models that expected most communication
    to take place with a relatively small number of servers were unable
    to cope with peer-to-peer traffic that was much less

Streaming media latency refers to the \"glass-to-glass\" time duration,
which is the delay between the real-life occurrence of an event and the
streamed media being appropriately played on an end user\'s device. Note
that this is different from the network latency (defined as the time for
a packet to cross a network from one end to another end) because it
includes media encoding/decoding and buffering time and, for most cases,
also the ingest to an intermediate service, such as a CDN or other media
distribution service, rather than a direct connection to an end
user.[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

The team working on this document found these rough categories to be
useful when considering a streaming media application\'s latency

Ultra-low-latency delivery of media is defined here as having a
glass-to-glass delay target under 1 second.[¶](#section-4.1-1){.pilcrow}

Some media content providers aim to achieve this level of latency for
live media events. This introduces new challenges when compared to the
other latency categories described in [Section 4](#latency-cons){.auto
.internal .xref}, because ultra-low-latency is on the same scale as
commonly observed end-to-end network latency variation, often due to
bufferbloat \[[CoDel](#CoDel){.cite .xref}\], Wi-Fi error correction, or
packet reordering. These effects can make it difficult to achieve
ultra-low-latency for many users and may require accepting relatively
frequent user-visible media artifacts. However, for controlled
environments that provide mitigations against such effects,
ultra-low-latency is potentially achievable with the right provisioning
and the right media transport technologies.[¶](#section-4.1-2){.pilcrow}

Most applications operating over IP networks and requiring latency this
low use the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP)
\[[RFC3550](#RFC3550){.cite .xref}\] or WebRTC
\[[RFC8825](#RFC8825){.cite .xref}\], which uses RTP as its media
transport protocol, along with several other protocols necessary for
safe operation in browsers.[¶](#section-4.1-3){.pilcrow}

It is worth noting that many applications for ultra-low-latency delivery
do not need to scale to as many users as applications for low-latency
and non-low-latency live delivery, which simplifies many delivery
considerations.[¶](#section-4.1-4){.pilcrow}

Recommended reading for applications adopting an RTP-based approach also
includes \[[RFC7656](#RFC7656){.cite .xref}\]. For increasing the
robustness of the playback by implementing adaptive playout methods,
refer to \[[RFC4733](#RFC4733){.cite .xref}\] and

Some Internet applications that incorporate media streaming have

Low-latency live delivery of media is defined here as having a
glass-to-glass delay target under 10
seconds.[¶](#section-4.2-1){.pilcrow}

This level of latency is targeted to have a user experience similar to
broadcast TV delivery. A frequently cited problem with failing to
achieve this level of latency for live sporting events is the user
experience failure from having crowds within earshot of one another who
react audibly to an important play or from users who learn of an event
in the match via some other channel, for example, social media, before
it has happened on the screen showing the sporting
event.[¶](#section-4.2-2){.pilcrow}

Applications requiring low-latency live media delivery are generally
feasible at scale with some restrictions. This typically requires the
use of a premium service dedicated to the delivery of live media, and
some trade-offs may be necessary relative to what is feasible in a
higher-latency service. The trade-offs may include higher costs,
delivering a lower quality media, reduced flexibility for adaptive
bitrates, or reduced flexibility for available resolutions so that fewer
devices can receive an encoding tuned for their display. Low-latency
live delivery is also more susceptible to user-visible disruptions due
to transient network conditions than higher-latency
services.[¶](#section-4.2-3){.pilcrow}

Implementation of a low-latency live media service can be achieved with
the use of HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) \[[RFC8216](#RFC8216){.cite
.xref}\] by using its low-latency extension (called LL-HLS)
\[[HLS-RFC8216BIS](#HLS-RFC8216BIS){.cite .xref}\] or with Dynamic
Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) \[[MPEG-DASH](#MPEG-DASH){.cite
.xref}\] by using its low-latency extension (called LL-DASH)
\[[LL-DASH](#LL-DASH){.cite .xref}\]. These extensions use the Common
Media Application Format (CMAF) standard \[[MPEG-CMAF](#MPEG-CMAF){.cite
.xref}\] that allows the media to be packaged into and transmitted in
units smaller than segments, which are called \"chunks\" in CMAF
language. This way, the latency can be decoupled from the duration of
the media segments. Without a CMAF-like packaging, lower latencies can
only be achieved by using very short segment durations. However, using
shorter segments means using more frequent intra-coded frames, and that
is detrimental to video encoding quality. The CMAF standard allows us to
still use longer segments (improving encoding quality) without
penalizing latency.[¶](#section-4.2-4){.pilcrow}

While an LL-HLS client retrieves each chunk with a separate HTTP GET
request, an LL-DASH client uses the chunked transfer encoding feature of
the HTTP \[[CMAF-CTE](#CMAF-CTE){.cite .xref}\], which allows the
LL-DASH client to fetch all the chunks belonging to a segment with a
single GET request. An HTTP server can transmit the CMAF chunks to the
LL-DASH client as they arrive from the encoder/packager. A detailed
comparison of LL-HLS and LL-DASH is given in \[[MMSP20](#MMSP20){.cite
.xref}\].[¶](#section-4.2-5){.pilcrow}

Non-low-latency live delivery of media is defined here as a live stream
that does not have a latency target shorter than 10
seconds.[¶](#section-4.3-1){.pilcrow}

This level of latency is the historically common case for segmented
media delivery using HLS and DASH. This level of latency is often
considered adequate for content like news. This level of latency is also
sometimes achieved as a fallback state when some part of the delivery
system or the client-side players do not support low-latency live
streaming.[¶](#section-4.3-2){.pilcrow}

This level of latency can typically be achieved at scale with commodity
CDN services for HTTP(s) delivery, and in some cases, the increased time
window can allow for the production of a wider range of encoding options
relative to the requirements for a lower-latency service without the
need for increasing the hardware footprint, which can allow for wider
device interoperability.[¶](#section-4.3-3){.pilcrow}

### [4.4.](#section-4.4){.section-number .selfRef} [On-Demand](#name-on-demand){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-on-demand}

On-demand media streaming refers to the playback of pre-recorded media
based on a user\'s action. In some cases, on-demand media is produced as
a by-product of a live media production, using the same segments as the
live event but freezing the manifest that describes the media available
from the media server after the live event has finished. In other cases,
on-demand media is constructed out of pre-recorded assets with no
streaming necessarily involved during the production of the on-demand
content.[¶](#section-4.4-1){.pilcrow}

On-demand media generally is not subject to latency concerns, but other
timing-related considerations can still be as important or even more
important to the user experience than the same considerations with live
events. These considerations include the startup time, the stability of
the media stream\'s playback quality, and avoidance of stalls and other
media artifacts during the playback under all but the most severe
network conditions.[¶](#section-4.4-2){.pilcrow}

In some applications, optimizations are available to on-demand media but
are not always available to live events, such as preloading the first
segment for a startup time that does not have to wait for a network
download to begin.[¶](#section-4.4-3){.pilcrow}

### [5.1.](#section-5.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Overview](#name-overview){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-overview}

A simple model of media playback can be described as a media stream
consumer, a buffer, and a transport mechanism that fills the buffer. The
consumption rate is fairly static and is represented by the content
bitrate. The size of the buffer is also commonly a fixed size. The
buffer fill process needs to be at least fast enough to ensure that the
buffer is never empty; however, it also can have significant complexity
when things like personalization or advertising insertion workflows are
introduced.[¶](#section-5.1-1){.pilcrow}

The challenges in filling the buffer in a timely way fall into two broad
categories:[¶](#section-5.1-2){.pilcrow}

-   [Content variation (also sometimes called a \"bitrate ladder\") is
    the set of content renditions that are available at any given
    selection point.[¶](#section-5.1-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.1-3.1}
-   [Content selection comprises all of the steps a client uses to
    determine which content rendition to
    play.[¶](#section-5.1-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.1-3.2}

The mechanism used to select the bitrate is part of the content
selection, and the content variation is all of the different bitrate
renditions.[¶](#section-5.1-4){.pilcrow}

Adaptive bitrate streaming (\"ABR streaming\" or simply \"ABR\") is a
commonly used technique for dynamically adjusting the media quality of a
stream to match bandwidth availability. When this goal is achieved, the
media server will tend to send enough media that the media player does
not \"stall\", without sending so much media that the media player
cannot accept it.[¶](#section-5.1-5){.pilcrow}

ABR uses an application-level response strategy in which the streaming
client attempts to detect the available bandwidth of the network path by
first observing the successful application-layer download speed; then,
given the available bandwidth, the client chooses a bitrate for each of
the video, audio, subtitles, and metadata (among a limited number of
available options for each type of media) that fits within that
bandwidth, typically adjusting as changes in available bandwidth occur
in the network or changes in capabilities occur during the playback
(such as available memory, CPU, display size,
etc.).[¶](#section-5.1-6){.pilcrow}

### [5.2.](#section-5.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Adaptive Encoding](#name-adaptive-encoding){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-adaptive-encoding}

Media servers can provide media streams at various bitrates because the
media has been encoded at various bitrates. This is a so-called
\"ladder\" of bitrates that can be offered to media players as part of
the manifest so that the media player can select among the available
bitrate choices.[¶](#section-5.2-1){.pilcrow}

The media server may also choose to alter which bitrates are made
available to players by adding or removing bitrate options from the
ladder delivered to the player in subsequent manifests built and sent to
the player. This way, both the player, through its selection of bitrate
to request from the manifest, and the server, through its construction
of the bitrates offered in the manifest, are able to affect network
utilization.[¶](#section-5.2-2){.pilcrow}

### [5.3.](#section-5.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Adaptive Segmented Delivery](#name-adaptive-segmented-delivery){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-adaptive-segmented-delivery}

Adaptive segmented delivery attempts to optimize its own use of the path
between a media server and a media client. ABR playback is commonly
implemented by streaming clients using HLS \[[RFC8216](#RFC8216){.cite
.xref}\] or DASH \[[MPEG-DASH](#MPEG-DASH){.cite .xref}\] to perform a
reliable segmented delivery of media over HTTP. Different
implementations use different strategies \[[ABRSurvey](#ABRSurvey){.cite
.xref}\], often relying on proprietary algorithms (called rate
adaptation or bitrate selection algorithms) to perform available
bandwidth estimation/prediction and the bitrate
selection.[¶](#section-5.3-1){.pilcrow}

Many systems will do an initial probe or a very simple throughput speed
test at the start of media playback. This is done to get a rough sense
of the highest (total) media bitrate that the network between the server
and player will likely be able to provide under initial network
conditions. After the initial testing, clients tend to rely upon passive
network observations and will make use of player-side statistics, such
as buffer fill rates, to monitor and respond to changing network
conditions.[¶](#section-5.3-2){.pilcrow}

The choice of bitrate occurs within the context of optimizing for one or
more metrics monitored by the client, such as the highest achievable
audiovisual quality or the lowest chances for a rebuffering event
(playback stall).[¶](#section-5.3-3){.pilcrow}

::: {#advertising}
::: {#section-5.4 .section}
### [5.4.](#section-5.4){.section-number .selfRef} [Advertising](#name-advertising){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-advertising}

The inclusion of advertising alongside or interspersed with streaming
media content is common in today\'s media
landscape.[¶](#section-5.4-1){.pilcrow}

Some commonly used forms of advertising can introduce potential user
experience issues for a media stream. This section provides a very brief
overview of a complex and rapidly evolving
space.[¶](#section-5.4-2){.pilcrow}

The same techniques used to allow a media player to switch between
renditions of different bitrates at segment boundaries can also be used
to enable the dynamic insertion of advertisements (hereafter referred to
as \"ads\"), but this does not mean that the insertion of ads has no
effect on the user\'s quality of
experience.[¶](#section-5.4-3){.pilcrow}

Ads may be inserted with either Client-side Ad Insertion (CSAI) or
Server-side Ad Insertion (SSAI). In CSAI, the ABR manifest will
generally include links to an external ad server for some segments of
the media stream, while in SSAI, the server will remain the same during
ads but will include media segments that contain the advertising. In
SSAI, the media segments may or may not be sourced from an external ad
server like with CSAI.[¶](#section-5.4-4){.pilcrow}

In general, the more targeted the ad request is, the more requests the
ad service needs to be able to handle concurrently. If connectivity is
poor to the ad service, this can cause rebuffering even if the
underlying media assets (both content and ads) can be accessed quickly.
The less targeted the ad request is, the more likely that ad requests
can be consolidated and that ads can be cached similarly to the media
content.[¶](#section-5.4-5){.pilcrow}

In some cases, especially with SSAI, advertising space in a stream is
reserved for a specific advertiser and can be integrated with the video
so that the segments share the same encoding properties, such as
bitrate, dynamic range, and resolution. However, in many cases, ad
servers integrate with a Supply Side Platform (SSP) that offers
advertising space in real-time auctions via an Ad Exchange, with bids
for the advertising space coming from Demand Side Platforms (DSPs) that
collect money from advertisers for delivering the ads. Most such Ad
Exchanges use application-level protocol specifications published by the
Interactive Advertising Bureau \[[IAB-ADS](#IAB-ADS){.cite .xref}\], an
industry trade organization.[¶](#section-5.4-6){.pilcrow}

This ecosystem balances several competing objectives, and integrating
with it naively can produce surprising user experience results. For
example, ad server provisioning and/or the bitrate of the ad segments
might be different from that of the main content, and either of these
differences can result in playback stalls. For another example, since
the inserted ads are often produced independently, they might have a
different base volume level than the main content, which can make for a
jarring user experience.[¶](#section-5.4-7){.pilcrow}

Another major source of competing objectives comes from user privacy
considerations vs. the advertiser\'s incentives to target ads to user
segments based on behavioral data. Multiple studies, for example,
\[[BEHAVE](#BEHAVE){.cite .xref}\] and \[[BEHAVE2](#BEHAVE2){.cite
.xref}\], have reported large improvements in ad effectiveness when
using behaviorally targeted ads, relative to untargeted ads. This
provides a strong incentive for advertisers to gain access to the data
necessary to perform behavioral targeting, leading some to engage in
what is indistinguishable from a pervasive monitoring attack
\[[RFC7258](#RFC7258){.cite .xref}\] based on user tracking in order to
collect the relevant data. A more complete review of issues in this
space is available in \[[BALANCING](#BALANCING){.cite
.xref}\].[¶](#section-5.4-8){.pilcrow}

On top of these competing objectives, this market historically has had
incidents of misreporting of ad delivery to end users for financial gain
\[[ADFRAUD](#ADFRAUD){.cite .xref}\]. As a mitigation for concerns
driven by those incidents, some SSPs have required the use of specific
media players that include features like reporting of ad delivery or
providing additional user information that can be used for
tracking.[¶](#section-5.4-9){.pilcrow}

In general, this is a rapidly developing space with many considerations,
and media streaming operators engaged in advertising may need to
research these and other concerns to find solutions that meet their user
experience, user privacy, and financial goals. For further reading on
mitigations, \[[BAP](#BAP){.cite .xref}\] has published some standards
and best practices based on user experience
research.[¶](#section-5.4-10){.pilcrow}

This kind of bandwidth-measurement system can experience various
troubles that are affected by networking and transport protocol issues.
Because adaptive application-level response strategies are often using
rates as observed by the application layer, there are sometimes
inscrutable transport-level protocol behaviors that can produce
surprising measurement values when the application-level feedback loop
is interacting with a transport-level feedback
loop.[¶](#section-5.5-1){.pilcrow}

A few specific examples of surprising phenomena that affect bitrate
detection measurements are described in the following subsections. As
these examples will demonstrate, it is common to encounter cases that
can deliver application-level measurements that are too low, too high,
and (possibly) correct but that vary more quickly than a lab-tested
selection algorithm might expect.[¶](#section-5.5-2){.pilcrow}

These effects and others that cause transport behavior to diverge from
lab modeling can sometimes have a significant impact on bitrate
selection and on user QoE, especially where players use naive
measurement strategies and selection algorithms that do not account for
the likelihood of bandwidth measurements that diverge from the true path
capacity.[¶](#section-5.5-3){.pilcrow}

When the bitrate selection is chosen substantially below the available
capacity of the network path, the response to a segment request will
typically complete in much less absolute time than the duration of the
requested segment, leaving significant idle time between segment
downloads. This can have a few surprising
consequences:[¶](#section-5.5.1-1){.pilcrow}

-   [TCP slow-start, when restarting after idle, requires multiple RTTs
    to re-establish a throughput at the network\'s available capacity.
    When the active transmission time for segments is substantially
    shorter than the time between segments, leaving an idle gap between
    segments that triggers a restart of TCP slow-start, the estimate of
    the successful download speed coming from the application-visible
    receive rate on the socket can thus end up much lower than the
    actual available network capacity. This, in turn, can prevent a
    shift to the most appropriate bitrate. \[[RFC7661](#RFC7661){.cite
    .xref}\] provides some mitigations for this effect at the TCP
    transport layer for senders who anticipate a high incidence of this
    problem.[¶](#section-5.5.1-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.5.1-2.1}
-   [Mobile flow-bandwidth spectrum and timing mapping can be impacted
    by idle time in some networks. The carrier capacity assigned to a
    physical or virtual link can vary with activity. Depending on the
    idle time characteristics, this can result in a lower available
    bitrate than would be achievable with a steadier transmission in the
    same network.[¶](#section-5.5.1-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.5.1-2.2}

Some receiver-side ABR algorithms, such as \[[ELASTIC](#ELASTIC){.cite
.xref}\], are designed to try to avoid this
effect.[¶](#section-5.5.1-3){.pilcrow}

Another way to mitigate this effect is by the help of two simultaneous
TCP connections, as explained in \[[MMSys11](#MMSys11){.cite .xref}\]
for Microsoft Smooth Streaming. In some cases, the system-level TCP
slow-start restart can also be disabled, for example, as described in
\[[OReilly-HPBN](#OReilly-HPBN){.cite

In addition to smoothing over an appropriate time scale to handle
network jitter (see \[[RFC5481](#RFC5481){.cite .xref}\]), ABR systems
relying on measurements at the application layer also have to account
for noise from the in-order data transmission at the transport
layer.[¶](#section-5.5.2-1){.pilcrow}

For instance, in the event of a lost packet on a TCP connection with
SACK support (a common case for segmented delivery in practice), loss of
a packet can provide a confusing bandwidth signal to the receiving
application. Because of the sliding window in TCP, many packets may be
accepted by the receiver without being available to the application
until the missing packet arrives. Upon the arrival of the one missing
packet after retransmit, the receiver will suddenly get access to a lot
of data at the same time.[¶](#section-5.5.2-2){.pilcrow}

To a receiver measuring bytes received per unit time at the application
layer and interpreting it as an estimate of the available network
bandwidth, this appears as a high jitter in the goodput measurement,
presenting as a stall followed by a sudden leap that can far exceed the
actual capacity of the transport path from the server when the hole in
the received data is filled by a later
retransmission.[¶](#section-5.5.2-3){.pilcrow}

As many end devices have moved to wireless connections for the final hop
(such as Wi-Fi, 5G, LTE, etc.), new problems in bandwidth detection have
emerged.[¶](#section-5.5.3-1){.pilcrow}

In most real-world operating environments, wireless links can often
experience sudden changes in capacity as the end user device moves from
place to place or encounters new sources of interference. Microwave

than a factor of 2 while active \[[Micro](#Micro){.cite

thousands of clients, and they have no concept of a \"session\" as a
client would have, so CDNs are decoupled from the metrics the clients
generate and report. A CDN cannot tell which request belongs to which
playback session, the duration of any media object, the bitrate, or
whether any of the clients have stalled and are rebuffering or are about
to stall and will rebuffer. The consequence of this decoupling is that a
CDN cannot prioritize delivery for when the client needs it most,
prefetch content, or trigger alerts when the network itself may be
underperforming. One approach to couple the CDN to the playback sessions
is for the clients to communicate standardized media-relevant
information to the CDNs while they are fetching data.

Within this document, the term \"media transport protocol\" is used to
describe any protocol that carries media metadata and media segments in
its payload, and the term \"transport protocol\" describes any protocol
that carries a media transport protocol, or another transport protocol,
in its payload. This is easier to understand if the reader assumes a
protocol stack that looks something like

    appropriate transport services, as described in [Section

    \[[RFC8095](#RFC8095){.cite
    .xref}\].[¶](#section-6-4.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-6-4.4}

Not all possible streaming media applications follow this model, but for
the ones that do, it seems useful to distinguish between the protocol
layer that is aware it is transporting media segments and underlying
protocol layers that are not aware.[¶](#section-6-5){.pilcrow}

As described in the abstract of \[[RFC8095](#RFC8095){.cite .xref}\],
the IETF has standardized a number of protocols that provide transport
services. Although these protocols, taken in total, provide a wide
variety of transport services, [Section 6](#sec-trans){.auto .internal
.xref} will distinguish between two extremes:[¶](#section-6-6){.pilcrow}

-   [transport protocols used to provide reliable, in-order media
    delivery to an endpoint, typically providing flow control and
    congestion control ([Section 6.1](#reliable-behavior){.auto
    .internal .xref}), and[¶](#section-6-7.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-6-7.1}
-   [transport protocols used to provide unreliable, unordered media
    delivery to an endpoint, without flow control or congestion control
    ([Section 6.2](#unreliable-behavior){.auto .internal
    .xref}).[¶](#section-6-7.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-6-7.2}

Because newly standardized transport protocols, such as QUIC
\[[RFC9000](#RFC9000){.cite .xref}\], that are typically implemented in
user space can evolve their transport behavior more rapidly than
currently used transport protocols that are typically implemented in
operating system kernel space, this document includes a description of
how the path characteristics that streaming media providers may see are
likely to evolve; see [Section 6.3](#quic-behavior){.auto .internal
.xref}.[¶](#section-6-8){.pilcrow}

It is worth noting explicitly that the transport protocol layer might
include more than one protocol. For example, a specific media transport
protocol might run over HTTP, or over WebTransport, which in turn runs
over HTTP.[¶](#section-6-9){.pilcrow}

It is worth noting explicitly that more complex network protocol stacks
are certainly possible \-- for instance, when packets with this protocol
stack are carried in a tunnel or in a VPN, the entire packet would
likely appear in the payload of other protocols. If these environments
are present, streaming media operators may need to analyze their effects
on applications as well.[¶](#section-6-10){.pilcrow}

### [6.1.](#section-6.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Media Transport over Reliable Transport Protocols](#name-media-transport-over-reliab){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-media-transport-over-reliab}

The HLS \[[RFC8216](#RFC8216){.cite .xref}\] and DASH
\[[MPEG-DASH](#MPEG-DASH){.cite .xref}\] media transport protocols are
typically carried over HTTP, and HTTP has used TCP as its only
standardized transport protocol until HTTP/3 \[[RFC9114](#RFC9114){.cite
.xref}\]. These media transport protocols use ABR response strategies as
described in [Section 5](#sec-abr){.auto .internal .xref} to respond to
changing path characteristics, and underlying transport protocols are
also attempting to respond to changing path
characteristics.[¶](#section-6.1-1){.pilcrow}

The past success of the largely TCP-based Internet is evidence that the
various flow control and congestion control mechanisms that TCP has used
to achieve equilibrium quickly, at a point where TCP senders do not
interfere with other TCP senders for sustained periods of time
\[[RFC5681](#RFC5681){.cite .xref}\], have been largely successful. The
Internet has continued to work even when the specific TCP mechanisms
used to reach equilibrium changed over time \[[RFC7414](#RFC7414){.cite
.xref}\]. Because TCP provided a common tool to avoid contention, even
when significant TCP-based applications like FTP were largely replaced
by other significant TCP-based applications like HTTP, the transport
behavior remained safe for the Internet.[¶](#section-6.1-2){.pilcrow}

Modern TCP implementations \[[RFC9293](#RFC9293){.cite .xref}\] continue
to probe for available bandwidth and \"back off\" when a network path is
saturated but may also work to avoid growing queues along network paths,
which can prevent older TCP senders from quickly detecting when a
network path is becoming saturated. Congestion control mechanisms, such
as Copa \[[COPA18](#COPA18){.cite .xref}\] and Bottleneck Bandwidth and
Round-trip propagation time (BBR)
\[[BBR-CONGESTION-CONTROL](#I-D.cardwell-iccrg-bbr-congestion-control){.cite
.xref}\], make these decisions based on measured path delays, assuming
that if the measured path delay is increasing, the sender is injecting
packets onto the network path faster than the network can forward them
(or the receiver can accept them), so the sender should adjust its
sending rate accordingly.[¶](#section-6.1-3){.pilcrow}

Although common TCP behavior has changed significantly since the days of
\[[Jacobson-Karels](#Jacobson-Karels){.cite .xref}\] and
\[[RFC2001](#RFC2001){.cite .xref}\], even with adding new congestion
controllers such as CUBIC \[[RFC8312](#RFC8312){.cite .xref}\], the
common practice of implementing TCP as part of an operating system
kernel has acted to limit how quickly TCP behavior can change. Even with
the widespread use of automated operating system update installation on
many end-user systems, streaming media providers could have a reasonable
expectation that they could understand TCP transport protocol behaviors
and that those behaviors would remain relatively stable in the short
term.[¶](#section-6.1-4){.pilcrow}

### [6.2.](#section-6.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Media Transport over Unreliable Transport Protocols](#name-media-transport-over-unreli){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-media-transport-over-unreli}

Because UDP does not provide any feedback mechanism to senders to help
limit impacts on other users, UDP-based application-level protocols have
been responsible for the decisions that TCP-based applications have
delegated to TCP, i.e., what to send, how much to send, and when to send
it. Because UDP itself has no transport-layer feedback mechanisms,
UDP-based applications that send and receive substantial amounts of
information are expected to provide their own feedback mechanisms and to
respond to the feedback the application receives. This expectation is
most recently codified as a Best Current Practice
\[[RFC8085](#RFC8085){.cite .xref}\].[¶](#section-6.2-1){.pilcrow}

In contrast to adaptive segmented delivery over a reliable transport as
described in [Section 5.3](#adapt-deliver){.auto .internal .xref}, some
applications deliver streaming media segments using an unreliable
transport and rely on a variety of approaches,
including:[¶](#section-6.2-2){.pilcrow}

-   [media encapsulated in a raw MPEG Transport Stream (MPEG-TS)
    \[[MPEG-TS](#MPEG-TS){.cite .xref}\] over UDP, which makes no
    attempt to account for reordering or loss in the
    transport,[¶](#section-6.2-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.2-3.1}
-   [RTP \[[RFC3550](#RFC3550){.cite .xref}\], which can notice packet
    loss and repair some limited
    reordering,[¶](#section-6.2-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.2-3.2}
-   [the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP)
    \[[RFC9260](#RFC9260){.cite .xref}\], which can use partial
    reliability \[[RFC3758](#RFC3758){.cite .xref}\] to recover from
    some loss but can abandon recovery to limit head-of-line blocking,
    and[¶](#section-6.2-3.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.2-3.3}
-   [the Secure Reliable Transport (SRT) \[[SRT](#SRT){.cite .xref}\],
    which can use forward error correction and time-bound retransmission
    to recover from loss within certain limits but can abandon recovery
    to limit head-of-line
    blocking.[¶](#section-6.2-3.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.2-3.4}

Under congestion and loss, approaches like the above generally
experience transient media artifacts more often and delay of playback
effects less often, as compared with reliable segment transport. Often,
one of the key goals of using a UDP-based transport that allows some
unreliability is to reduce latency and better support applications like
videoconferencing or other live-action video with interactive
components, such as some sporting events.[¶](#section-6.2-4){.pilcrow}

Congestion avoidance strategies for deployments using unreliable
transport protocols vary widely in practice, ranging from being entirely
unresponsive to responding by using strategies,
including:[¶](#section-6.2-5){.pilcrow}

-   [feedback signaling to change encoder settings (as in
    \[[RFC5762](#RFC5762){.cite
    .xref}\]),[¶](#section-6.2-6.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.2-6.1}
-   [fewer enhancement layers (as in \[[RFC6190](#RFC6190){.cite
    .xref}\]), and[¶](#section-6.2-6.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.2-6.2}
-   [proprietary methods to detect QoE issues and turn off video to
    allow less bandwidth-intensive media, such as audio, to be
    delivered.[¶](#section-6.2-6.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.2-6.3}

RTP relies on RTCP sender and receiver reports
\[[RFC3550](#RFC3550){.cite .xref}\] as its own feedback mechanism and
even includes circuit breakers for unicast RTP sessions
\[[RFC8083](#RFC8083){.cite .xref}\] for situations when normal RTP
congestion control has not been able to react sufficiently to RTP flows
sending at rates that result in sustained packet
loss.[¶](#section-6.2-7){.pilcrow}

The notion of \"circuit breakers\" has also been applied to other UDP
applications in \[[RFC8084](#RFC8084){.cite .xref}\], such as tunneling
packets over UDP that are potentially not congestion controlled (for
example, \"encapsulating MPLS in UDP\", as described in
\[[RFC7510](#RFC7510){.cite .xref}\]). If streaming media segments are
carried in tunnels encapsulated in UDP, these media streams may
encounter \"tripped circuit breakers\", with resulting user-visible
impacts.[¶](#section-6.2-8){.pilcrow}

### [6.3.](#section-6.3){.section-number .selfRef} [QUIC and Changing Transport Protocol Behavior](#name-quic-and-changing-transport){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-quic-and-changing-transport}

The QUIC protocol, developed from a proprietary protocol into an IETF
Standards Track protocol \[[RFC9000](#RFC9000){.cite .xref}\], behaves
differently than the transport protocols characterized in Sections
[6.1](#reliable-behavior){.auto .internal .xref} and
[6.2](#unreliable-behavior){.auto .internal
.xref}.[¶](#section-6.3-1){.pilcrow}

Although QUIC provides an alternative to the TCP and UDP transport
protocols, QUIC is itself encapsulated in UDP. As noted elsewhere in
[Section 7.1](#gen-encrypt){.auto .internal .xref}, the QUIC protocol
encrypts almost all of its transport parameters and all of its payload,
so any intermediaries that network operators may be using to
troubleshoot HTTP streaming media performance issues, perform analytics,
or even intercept exchanges in current applications will not work for
QUIC-based applications without making changes to their networks.
[Section 7](#stream-encrypt-media){.auto .internal .xref} describes the
implications of media encryption in more
detail.[¶](#section-6.3-2){.pilcrow}

While QUIC is designed as a general-purpose transport protocol and can
carry different application-layer protocols, the current standardized
mapping is for HTTP/3 \[[RFC9114](#RFC9114){.cite .xref}\], which
describes how QUIC transport services are used for HTTP. The convention
is for HTTP/3 to run over UDP port 443 \[[Port443](#Port443){.cite
.xref}\], but this is not a strict
requirement.[¶](#section-6.3-3){.pilcrow}

When HTTP/3 is encapsulated in QUIC, which is then encapsulated in UDP,
streaming operators (and network operators) might see UDP traffic
patterns that are similar to HTTP(S) over TCP. UDP ports may be blocked
for any port numbers that are not commonly used, such as UDP 53 for DNS.
Even when UDP ports are not blocked and QUIC packets can flow, streaming
operators (and network operators) may severely rate-limit this traffic
because they do not expect to see legitimate high-bandwidth traffic,
such as streaming media over the UDP ports that HTTP/3 is
using.[¶](#section-6.3-4){.pilcrow}

As noted in [Section 5.5.2](#noisy-measurements){.auto .internal .xref},
because TCP provides a reliable, in-order delivery service for
applications, any packet loss for a TCP connection causes head-of-line
blocking so that no TCP segments arriving after a packet is lost will be
delivered to the receiving application until retransmission of the lost
packet has been received, allowing in-order delivery to the application
to continue. As described in \[[RFC9000](#RFC9000){.cite .xref}\], QUIC
connections can carry multiple streams, and when packet losses do occur,
only the streams carried in the lost packet are
delayed.[¶](#section-6.3-5){.pilcrow}

A QUIC extension currently being specified \[[RFC9221](#RFC9221){.cite
.xref}\] adds the capability for \"unreliable\" delivery, similar to the
service provided by UDP, but these datagrams are still subject to the
QUIC connection\'s congestion controller, providing some transport-level
congestion avoidance measures, which UDP does
not.[¶](#section-6.3-6){.pilcrow}

As noted in [Section 6.1](#reliable-behavior){.auto .internal .xref},
there is an increasing interest in congestion control algorithms that
respond to delay measurements instead of responding to packet loss.
These algorithms may deliver an improved user experience, but in some
cases, they have not responded to sustained packet loss, which exhausts
available buffers along the end-to-end path that may affect other users
sharing that path. The QUIC protocol provides a set of congestion
control hooks that can be used for algorithm agility, and
\[[RFC9002](#RFC9002){.cite .xref}\] defines a basic congestion control
algorithm that is roughly similar to TCP NewReno
\[[RFC6582](#RFC6582){.cite .xref}\]. However, QUIC senders can and do
unilaterally choose to use different algorithms, such as loss-based
CUBIC \[[RFC8312](#RFC8312){.cite .xref}\], delay-based Copa or BBR, or
even something completely different.[¶](#section-6.3-7){.pilcrow}

The Internet community does have experience with deploying new
congestion controllers without causing congestion collapse on the
Internet. As noted in \[[RFC8312](#RFC8312){.cite .xref}\], both the
CUBIC congestion controller and its predecessor BIC have significantly
different behavior from Reno-style congestion controllers, such as TCP
NewReno \[[RFC6582](#RFC6582){.cite .xref}\]; both were added to the
Linux kernel to allow experimentation and analysis, both were then
selected as the default TCP congestion controllers in Linux, and both
were deployed globally.[¶](#section-6.3-8){.pilcrow}

The point mentioned in [Section 6.1](#reliable-behavior){.auto .internal
.xref} about TCP congestion controllers being implemented in operating
system kernels is different with QUIC. Although QUIC can be implemented
in operating system kernels, one of the design goals when this work was
chartered was \"QUIC is expected to support rapid, distributed
development and testing of features\"; to meet this expectation, many
implementers have chosen to implement QUIC in user space, outside the
operating system kernel, and to even distribute QUIC libraries with
their own applications. It is worth noting that streaming operators
using HTTP/3, carried over QUIC, can expect more frequent deployment of
new congestion controller behavior than has been the case with HTTP/1
and HTTP/2, carried over TCP.[¶](#section-6.3-9){.pilcrow}

It is worth considering that if TCP-based HTTP traffic and UDP-based
HTTP/3 traffic are allowed to enter operator networks on roughly equal
terms, questions of fairness and contention will be heavily dependent on
interactions between the congestion controllers in use for TCP-based
HTTP traffic and UDP-based HTTP/3 traffic.[¶](#section-6.3-10){.pilcrow}

\"Encrypted Media\" has at least three
meanings:[¶](#section-7-1){.pilcrow}

-   [Media encrypted at the application layer, typically using some sort
    of Digital Rights Management (DRM) system or other object
    encryption/security mechanism and typically remaining encrypted at
    rest when senders and receivers store
    it.[¶](#section-7-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-7-2.1}
-   [Media encrypted by the sender at the transport layer and remaining
    encrypted until it reaches the ultimate media consumer (in this
    document, it is referred to as end-to-end media
    encryption).[¶](#section-7-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-7-2.2}
-   [Media encrypted by the sender at the transport layer and remaining
    encrypted until it reaches some intermediary that is *not* the
    ultimate media consumer but has credentials allowing decryption of
    the media content. This intermediary may examine and even transform
    the media content in some way, before forwarding re-encrypted media
    content (in this document, it is referred to as hop-by-hop media
    encryption).[¶](#section-7-2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-7-2.3}

This document focuses on media encrypted at the transport layer, whether
encryption is performed hop by hop or end to end. Because media
encrypted at the application layer will only be processed by
application-level entities, this encryption does not have
transport-layer implications. Of course, both hop-by-hop and end-to-end
encrypted transport may carry media that is, in addition, encrypted at
the application layer.[¶](#section-7-3){.pilcrow}

Each of these encryption strategies is intended to achieve a different
goal. For instance, application-level encryption may be used for
business purposes, such as avoiding piracy or enforcing geographic
restrictions on playback, while transport-layer encryption may be used
to prevent media stream manipulation or to protect
manifests.[¶](#section-7-4){.pilcrow}

This document does not take a position on whether those goals are
valid.[¶](#section-7-5){.pilcrow}

Both end-to-end and hop-by-hop media encryption have specific
implications for streaming operators. These are described in Sections
[7.2](#hop-by-hop-encrypt){.auto .internal .xref} and
[7.3](#e2em-encrypt){.auto .internal .xref}.[¶](#section-7-6){.pilcrow}

### [7.1.](#section-7.1){.section-number .selfRef} [General Considerations for Streaming Media Encryption](#name-general-considerations-for-){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-general-considerations-for-}

The use of strong encryption does provide confidentiality for encrypted
streaming media, from the sender to either the ultimate media consumer
or to an intermediary that possesses credentials allowing decryption.
This does prevent deep packet inspection (DPI) by any on-path
intermediary that does not possess credentials allowing decryption.
However, even encrypted content streams may be vulnerable to traffic
analysis. An on-path observer that can identify that encrypted traffic
contains a media stream could \"fingerprint\" this encrypted media
stream and then compare it against \"fingerprints\" of known content.
The protection provided by strong encryption can be further lessened if
a streaming media operator is repeatedly encrypting the same content.
\"Identifying HTTPS-Protected Netflix Videos in Real-Time\"
\[[CODASPY17](#CODASPY17){.cite .xref}\] is an example of what is
possible when identifying HTTPS-protected videos over TCP transport,
based either on the length of entire resources being transferred or on
characteristic packet patterns at the beginning of a resource being
transferred. If traffic analysis is successful at identifying encrypted
content and associating it with specific users, this tells an on-path
observer what resource is being streamed, and by who, almost as
certainly as examining decrypted traffic.[¶](#section-7.1-1){.pilcrow}

Because HTTPS has historically layered HTTP on top of TLS, which is in
turn layered on top of TCP, intermediaries have historically had access
to unencrypted TCP-level transport information, such as retransmissions,
and some carriers exploited this information in attempts to improve
transport-layer performance \[[RFC3135](#RFC3135){.cite .xref}\]. The
most recent standardized version of HTTPS, HTTP/3
\[[RFC9114](#RFC9114){.cite .xref}\], uses the QUIC protocol
\[[RFC9000](#RFC9000){.cite .xref}\] as its transport layer. QUIC relies
on the TLS 1.3 initial handshake \[[RFC8446](#RFC8446){.cite .xref}\]
only for key exchange \[[RFC9001](#RFC9001){.cite .xref}\] and encrypts
almost all transport parameters itself, except for a few invariant
header fields. In the QUIC short header, the only transport-level
parameter that is sent \"in the clear\" is the Destination Connection ID
\[[RFC8999](#RFC8999){.cite .xref}\], and even in the QUIC long header,
the only transport-level parameters sent \"in the clear\" are the
version, Destination Connection ID, and Source Connection ID. For these
reasons, HTTP/3 is significantly more \"opaque\" than HTTPS with HTTP/1
or HTTP/2.[¶](#section-7.1-2){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC9312](#RFC9312){.cite .xref}\] discusses the manageability of the
QUIC transport protocol that is used to encapsulate HTTP/3, focusing on
the implications of QUIC\'s design and wire image on network operations
involving QUIC traffic. It discusses what network operators can consider
in some detail.[¶](#section-7.1-3){.pilcrow}

More broadly, \"Considerations around Transport Header Confidentiality,
Network Operations, and the Evolution of Internet Transport Protocols\"
\[[RFC9065](#RFC9065){.cite .xref}\] describes the impact of increased
encryption of transport headers in general
terms.[¶](#section-7.1-4){.pilcrow}

It is also worth noting that considerations for heavily encrypted
transport protocols also come into play when streaming media is carried
over IP-level VPNs and tunnels, with the additional consideration that
an intermediary that does not possess credentials allowing decryption
will not have visibility to the source and destination IP addresses of
the packets being carried inside the
tunnel.[¶](#section-7.1-5){.pilcrow}

Hop-by-hop media encryption offers the benefits described in [Section
7.1](#gen-encrypt){.auto .internal .xref} between the streaming media
operator and authorized intermediaries, among authorized intermediaries,
and between authorized intermediaries and the ultimate media consumer;
however, it does not provide these benefits end to end. The streaming
media operator and ultimate media consumer must trust the authorized
intermediaries, and if these intermediaries cannot be trusted, the
benefits of encryption are lost.[¶](#section-7.2-1){.pilcrow}

Although the IETF has put considerable emphasis on end-to-end streaming
media encryption, there are still important use cases that require the
insertion of intermediaries.[¶](#section-7.2-2){.pilcrow}

There are a variety of ways to involve intermediaries, and some are much
more intrusive than others.[¶](#section-7.2-3){.pilcrow}

From a streaming media operator\'s perspective, a number of
considerations are in play. The first question is likely whether the
streaming media operator intends that intermediaries are explicitly
addressed from endpoints or whether the streaming media operator is
willing to allow intermediaries to \"intercept\" streaming content
transparently, with no awareness or permission from either
endpoint.[¶](#section-7.2-4){.pilcrow}

If a streaming media operator does not actively work to avoid
interception by on-path intermediaries, the effect will be
indistinguishable from \"impersonation attacks\", and endpoints cannot
be assured of any level of confidentiality and cannot trust that the
content received came from the expected
sender.[¶](#section-7.2-5){.pilcrow}

Assuming that a streaming media operator does intend to allow
intermediaries to participate in content streaming and does intend to
provide some level of privacy for endpoints, there are a number of
possible tools, either already available or still being specified. These
include the following:[¶](#section-7.2-6){.pilcrow}

    clients and DASH-aware network elements or among various DASH-aware

    \[[SFRAME](#SFRAME){.cite .xref}\], also provides both hop-by-hop
    and end-to-end security guarantees but can be used with other media
    transport protocols beyond SRTP.[¶](#section-7.2-7.6){.pilcrow}
:   

A streaming media operator\'s choice of whether to involve
intermediaries requires careful consideration. As an example, when ABR
manifests were commonly sent unencrypted, some access network operators
would modify manifests during peak hours by removing high-bitrate
renditions to prevent players from choosing those renditions, thus
reducing the overall bandwidth consumed for delivering these media
streams and thereby reducing the network load and improving the average
user experience for their customers. Now that ubiquitous encryption
typically prevents this kind of modification, a streaming media operator
who used intermediaries in the past, and who now wishes to maintain the
same level of network health and user experience, must choose between
adding intermediaries who are authorized to change the manifests or
adding some other form of complexity to their
service.[¶](#section-7.2-8){.pilcrow}

Some resources that might inform other similar considerations are
further discussed in \[[RFC8824](#RFC8824){.cite .xref}\] (for WebRTC)
and \[[RFC9312](#RFC9312){.cite .xref}\] (for HTTP/3 and
QUIC).[¶](#section-7.2-9){.pilcrow}

### [7.3.](#section-7.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Considerations for End-to-End Media Encryption](#name-considerations-for-end-to-e){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-considerations-for-end-to-e}

End-to-end media encryption offers the benefits described in [Section
7.1](#gen-encrypt){.auto .internal .xref} from the streaming media
operator to the ultimate media consumer.[¶](#section-7.3-1){.pilcrow}

End-to-end media encryption has become much more widespread in the years
since the IETF issued \"Pervasive Monitoring Is an Attack\"
\[[RFC7258](#RFC7258){.cite .xref}\] as a Best Current Practice,
describing pervasive monitoring as a much greater threat than previously
appreciated. After the Snowden disclosures, many content providers made
the decision to use HTTPS protection \-- HTTP over TLS \-- for most or
all content being delivered as a routine practice, rather than in
exceptional cases for content that was considered
sensitive.[¶](#section-7.3-2){.pilcrow}

However, as noted in \[[RFC7258](#RFC7258){.cite .xref}\], there is no
way to prevent pervasive monitoring by an attacker while allowing
monitoring by a more benign entity who only wants to use DPI to examine
HTTP requests and responses to provide a better user experience. If a
modern encrypted transport protocol is used for end-to-end media
encryption, unauthorized on-path intermediaries are unable to examine
transport and application protocol behavior. As described in [Section
7.2](#hop-by-hop-encrypt){.auto .internal .xref}, only an intermediary
explicitly authorized by the streaming media operator who is to examine
packet payloads, rather than intercepting packets and examining them
without authorization, can continue these
practices.[¶](#section-7.3-3){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC7258](#RFC7258){.cite .xref}\] states that \"\[t\]he IETF will
strive to produce specifications that mitigate pervasive monitoring
attacks\", so streaming operators should expect the IETF\'s direction
toward preventing unauthorized monitoring of IETF protocols to continue
for the foreseeable future.[¶](#section-7.3-4){.pilcrow}
