The QUIC transport protocol \[[RFC9000](#RFC9000){.xref}\] provides a
secure, multiplexed connection for transmitting reliable streams of
application data. QUIC uses various frame types to transmit data within
packets, and each frame type defines whether the data it contains will
be retransmitted. Streams of reliable application data are sent using
STREAM frames.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

Some applications, particularly those that need to transmit real-time
data, prefer to transmit data unreliably. In the past, these
applications have built directly upon UDP \[[RFC0768](#RFC0768){.xref}\]
as a transport and have often added security with DTLS
\[[RFC6347](#RFC6347){.xref}\]. Extending QUIC to support transmitting
unreliable application data provides another option for secure datagrams
with the added benefit of sharing the cryptographic and authentication
context used for reliable streams.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

This document defines two new DATAGRAM QUIC frame types that carry
application data without requiring
retransmissions.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

Transmitting unreliable data over QUIC provides benefits over existing
solutions:[¶](#section-2-1){.pilcrow}

-   [Applications that want to use both a reliable stream and an
    unreliable flow to the same peer can benefit by sharing a single
    handshake and authentication context between a reliable QUIC stream
    and a flow of unreliable QUIC datagrams. This can reduce the latency
    required for handshakes compared to opening both a TLS connection
    and a DTLS connection.[¶](#section-2-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-2-2.1}
-   [QUIC uses a more nuanced loss recovery mechanism than the DTLS
    handshake. This can allow loss recovery to occur more quickly for
    QUIC data.[¶](#section-2-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-2-2.2}
-   [QUIC datagrams are subject to QUIC congestion control. Providing a
    single congestion control for both reliable and unreliable data can
    be more effective and
    efficient.[¶](#section-2-2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-2-2.3}

These features can be useful for optimizing audio/video streaming
applications, gaming applications, and other real-time network
applications.[¶](#section-2-3){.pilcrow}

Unreliable QUIC datagrams can also be used to implement an IP packet
tunnel over QUIC, such as for a Virtual Private Network (VPN).
Internet-layer tunneling protocols generally require a reliable and
authenticated handshake followed by unreliable secure transmission of IP
packets. This can, for example, require a TLS connection for the control
data and DTLS for tunneling IP packets. A single QUIC connection could
support both parts with the use of unreliable datagrams in addition to
reliable streams.[¶](#section-2-4){.pilcrow}

::: {#transport-parameter}
::: {#section-3 .section}
## [3.](#section-3){.section-number .selfRef} [Transport Parameter](#name-transport-parameter){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-transport-parameter}

Support for receiving the DATAGRAM frame types is advertised by means of
a QUIC transport parameter (name=max_datagram_frame_size, value=0x20).
The max_datagram_frame_size transport parameter is an integer value
(represented as a variable-length integer) that represents the maximum
size of a DATAGRAM frame (including the frame type, length, and payload)
the endpoint is willing to receive, in bytes.[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

The default for this parameter is 0, which indicates that the endpoint
does not support DATAGRAM frames. A value greater than 0 indicates that
the endpoint supports the DATAGRAM frame types and is willing to receive
such frames on this connection.[¶](#section-3-2){.pilcrow}

An endpoint [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} send DATAGRAM frames until it has
received the max_datagram_frame_size transport parameter with a non-zero
value during the handshake (or during a previous handshake if 0-RTT is
used). An endpoint [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} send DATAGRAM frames that are
larger than the max_datagram_frame_size value it has received from its
peer. An endpoint that receives a DATAGRAM frame when it has not
indicated support via the transport parameter [MUST]{.bcp14} terminate
the connection with an error of type PROTOCOL_VIOLATION. Similarly, an
endpoint that receives a DATAGRAM frame that is larger than the value it
sent in its max_datagram_frame_size transport parameter [MUST]{.bcp14}
terminate the connection with an error of type
PROTOCOL_VIOLATION.[¶](#section-3-3){.pilcrow}

For most uses of DATAGRAM frames, it is [RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14} to send a
value of 65535 in the max_datagram_frame_size transport parameter to
indicate that this endpoint will accept any DATAGRAM frame that fits
inside a QUIC packet.[¶](#section-3-4){.pilcrow}

The max_datagram_frame_size transport parameter is a unidirectional
limit and indication of support of DATAGRAM frames. Application
protocols that use DATAGRAM frames [MAY]{.bcp14} choose to only
negotiate and use them in a single direction.[¶](#section-3-5){.pilcrow}

When clients use 0-RTT, they [MAY]{.bcp14} store the value of the
server\'s max_datagram_frame_size transport parameter. Doing so allows
the client to send DATAGRAM frames in 0-RTT packets. When servers decide
to accept 0-RTT data, they [MUST]{.bcp14} send a max_datagram_frame_size
transport parameter greater than or equal to the value they sent to the
client in the connection where they sent them the NewSessionTicket
message. If a client stores the value of the max_datagram_frame_size
transport parameter with their 0-RTT state, they [MUST]{.bcp14} validate
that the new value of the max_datagram_frame_size transport parameter
sent by the server in the handshake is greater than or equal to the
stored value; if not, the client [MUST]{.bcp14} terminate the connection
with error PROTOCOL_VIOLATION.[¶](#section-3-6){.pilcrow}

Application protocols that use datagrams [MUST]{.bcp14} define how they
react to the absence of the max_datagram_frame_size transport parameter.
If datagram support is integral to the application, the application
protocol can fail the handshake if the max_datagram_frame_size transport
parameter is not present.[¶](#section-3-7){.pilcrow}

## [4.](#section-4){.section-number .selfRef} [Datagram Frame Types](#name-datagram-frame-types){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-datagram-frame-types}

DATAGRAM frames are used to transmit application data in an unreliable
manner. The Type field in the DATAGRAM frame takes the form 0b0011000X
(or the values 0x30 and 0x31). The least significant bit of the Type
field in the DATAGRAM frame is the LEN bit (0x01), which indicates
whether there is a Length field present: if this bit is set to 0, the
Length field is absent and the Datagram Data field extends to the end of
the packet; if this bit is set to 1, the Length field is
present.[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

DATAGRAM frames are structured as follows:[¶](#section-4-2){.pilcrow}

DATAGRAM frames contain the following fields:[¶](#section-4-4){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

Length:

:   A variable-length integer specifying the length of the Datagram Data
    field in bytes. This field is present only when the LEN bit is set
    to 1. When the LEN bit is set to 0, the Datagram Data field extends
    to the end of the QUIC packet. Note that empty (i.e., zero-length)
    datagrams are allowed.[¶](#section-4-5.2.1){.pilcrow}

Datagram Data:

:   The bytes of the datagram to be
    delivered.[¶](#section-4-5.4.1){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-5 .section}
## [5.](#section-5){.section-number .selfRef} [Behavior and Usage](#name-behavior-and-usage){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-behavior-and-usage}

When an application sends a datagram over a QUIC connection, QUIC will
generate a new DATAGRAM frame and send it in the first available packet.
This frame [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be sent as soon as possible (as determined
by factors like congestion control, described below) and [MAY]{.bcp14}
be coalesced with other frames.[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

When a QUIC endpoint receives a valid DATAGRAM frame, it
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} deliver the data to the application immediately, as
long as it is able to process the frame and can store the contents in
memory.[¶](#section-5-2){.pilcrow}

Like STREAM frames, DATAGRAM frames contain application data and
[MUST]{.bcp14} be protected with either 0-RTT or 1-RTT
keys.[¶](#section-5-3){.pilcrow}

Note that while the max_datagram_frame_size transport parameter places a
limit on the maximum size of DATAGRAM frames, that limit can be further
reduced by the max_udp_payload_size transport parameter and the Maximum
Transmission Unit (MTU) of the path between endpoints. DATAGRAM frames
cannot be fragmented; therefore, application protocols need to handle
cases where the maximum datagram size is limited by other
factors.[¶](#section-5-4){.pilcrow}

::: {#multiplexing-datagrams}
::: {#section-5.1 .section}
### [5.1.](#section-5.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Multiplexing Datagrams](#name-multiplexing-datagrams){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-multiplexing-datagrams}

DATAGRAM frames belong to a QUIC connection as a whole and are not
associated with any stream ID at the QUIC layer. However, it is expected
that applications will want to differentiate between specific DATAGRAM
frames by using identifiers, such as for logical flows of datagrams or
to distinguish between different kinds of
datagrams.[¶](#section-5.1-1){.pilcrow}

Defining the identifiers used to multiplex different kinds of datagrams
or flows of datagrams is the responsibility of the application protocol
running over QUIC. The application defines the semantics of the Datagram
Data field and how it is parsed.[¶](#section-5.1-2){.pilcrow}

If the application needs to support the coexistence of multiple flows of
datagrams, one recommended pattern is to use a variable-length integer
at the beginning of the Datagram Data field. This is a simple approach
that allows a large number of flows to be encoded using minimal
space.[¶](#section-5.1-3){.pilcrow}

QUIC implementations [SHOULD]{.bcp14} present an API to applications to
assign relative priorities to DATAGRAM frames with respect to each other
and to QUIC streams.[¶](#section-5.1-4){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-5.2 .section}
### [5.2.](#section-5.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Acknowledgement Handling](#name-acknowledgement-handling){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-acknowledgement-handling}

Although DATAGRAM frames are not retransmitted upon loss detection, they
are ack-eliciting (\[[RFC9002](#RFC9002){.xref}\]). Receivers
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} support delaying ACK frames (within the limits
specified by max_ack_delay) in response to receiving packets that only
contain DATAGRAM frames, since the sender takes no action if these
packets are temporarily unacknowledged. Receivers will continue to send
ACK frames when conditions indicate a packet might be lost, since the
packet\'s payload is unknown to the receiver, and when dictated by
max_ack_delay or other protocol components.[¶](#section-5.2-1){.pilcrow}

As with any ack-eliciting frame, when a sender suspects that a packet
containing only DATAGRAM frames has been lost, it sends probe packets to
elicit a faster acknowledgement as described in [Section
6.2.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9002#section-6.2.4){.relref} of
\[[RFC9002](#RFC9002){.xref}\].[¶](#section-5.2-2){.pilcrow}

If a sender detects that a packet containing a specific DATAGRAM frame
might have been lost, the implementation [MAY]{.bcp14} notify the
application that it believes the datagram was
lost.[¶](#section-5.2-3){.pilcrow}

Similarly, if a packet containing a DATAGRAM frame is acknowledged, the
implementation [MAY]{.bcp14} notify the sender application that the
datagram was successfully transmitted and received. Due to reordering,
this can include a DATAGRAM frame that was thought to be lost but, at a
later point, was received and acknowledged. It is important to note that
acknowledgement of a DATAGRAM frame only indicates that the
transport-layer handling on the receiver processed the frame and does
not guarantee that the application on the receiver successfully
processed the data. Thus, this signal cannot replace application-layer
signals that indicate successful
processing.[¶](#section-5.2-4){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-5.3 .section}
### [5.3.](#section-5.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Flow Control](#name-flow-control){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-flow-control}

DATAGRAM frames do not provide any explicit flow control signaling and
do not contribute to any per-flow or connection-wide data
limit.[¶](#section-5.3-1){.pilcrow}

The risk associated with not providing flow control for DATAGRAM frames
is that a receiver might not be able to commit the necessary resources
to process the frames. For example, it might not be able to store the
frame contents in memory. However, since DATAGRAM frames are inherently
unreliable, they [MAY]{.bcp14} be dropped by the receiver if the
receiver cannot process them.[¶](#section-5.3-2){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-5.4 .section}
### [5.4.](#section-5.4){.section-number .selfRef} [Congestion Control](#name-congestion-control){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-congestion-control}

DATAGRAM frames employ the QUIC connection\'s congestion controller. As
a result, a connection might be unable to send a DATAGRAM frame
generated by the application until the congestion controller allows it
\[[RFC9002](#RFC9002){.xref}\]. The sender [MUST]{.bcp14} either delay
sending the frame until the controller allows it or drop the frame
without sending it (at which point it [MAY]{.bcp14} notify the
application). Implementations that use packet pacing ([Section
7.7](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9002#section-7.7){.relref} of
\[[RFC9002](#RFC9002){.xref}\]) can also delay the sending of DATAGRAM
frames to maintain consistent packet
pacing.[¶](#section-5.4-1){.pilcrow}

Implementations can optionally support allowing the application to
specify a sending expiration time beyond which a congestion-controlled
DATAGRAM frame ought to be dropped without
transmission.[¶](#section-5.4-2){.pilcrow}

::: {#security-considerations}
::: {#section-6 .section}
## [6.](#section-6){.section-number .selfRef} [Security Considerations](#name-security-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-security-considerations}

The DATAGRAM frame shares the same security properties as the rest of
the data transmitted within a QUIC connection, and the security
considerations of \[[RFC9000](#RFC9000){.xref}\] apply accordingly. All
application data transmitted with the DATAGRAM frame, like the STREAM
frame, [MUST]{.bcp14} be protected either by 0-RTT or 1-RTT
keys.[¶](#section-6-1){.pilcrow}

Application protocols that allow DATAGRAM frames to be sent in 0-RTT
require a profile that defines acceptable use of 0-RTT; see [Section
5.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9001#section-5.6){.relref} of
\[[RFC9001](#RFC9001){.xref}\].[¶](#section-6-2){.pilcrow}

The use of DATAGRAM frames might be detectable by an adversary on path
that is capable of dropping packets. Since DATAGRAM frames do not use
transport-level retransmission, connections that use DATAGRAM frames
might be distinguished from other connections due to their different
response to packet loss.[¶](#section-6-3){.pilcrow}
