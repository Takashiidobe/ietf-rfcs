# Babel Information Model {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

The Babel information model provides structured data elements for a
Babel implementation reporting its current state and may allow limited
configuration of some such data elements. This information model can be
used as a basis for creating data models under various data modeling
regimes. This information model only includes parameters and parameter
values useful for managing Babel over
IPv6.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

Babel is a loop-avoiding, distance-vector routing protocol defined in
\[[RFC8966](#RFC8966){.xref}\]. \[[RFC8967](#RFC8967){.xref}\] defines a
security mechanism that allows Babel packets to be cryptographically
authenticated, and \[[RFC8968](#RFC8968){.xref}\] defines a security
mechanism that allows Babel packets to be both authenticated and
encrypted. This document describes an information model for Babel
(including implementations using one or both of these security
mechanisms) that can be used to create management protocol data models
(such as a NETCONF \[[RFC6241](#RFC6241){.xref}\] YANG
\[[RFC7950](#RFC7950){.xref}\] data model).[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

Due to the simplicity of the Babel protocol, most of the information
model is focused on reporting the Babel protocol operational state, and
very little of that is considered mandatory to implement for an
implementation claiming compliance with this information model. Some
parameters may be configurable. However, it is up to the Babel
implementation whether to allow any of these to be configured within its
implementation. Where the implementation does not allow configuration of
these parameters, it [MAY]{.bcp14} still choose to expose them as
read-only.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

The information model is presented using a hierarchical structure. This
does not preclude a data model based on this information model from
using a referential or other structure.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

This information model only includes parameters and parameter values
useful for managing Babel over IPv6. This model has no parameters or
values specific to operating Babel over IPv4, even though
\[[RFC8966](#RFC8966){.xref}\] does define a multicast group for sending
and listening to multicast announcements on IPv4. There is less
likelihood of breakage due to inconsistent configuration and increased
implementation simplicity if Babel is operated always and only over
IPv6. Running Babel over IPv6 requires IPv6 at the link layer and does
not need advertised prefixes, router advertisements, or DHCPv6 to be
present in the network. Link-local IPv6 is widely supported among
devices where Babel is expected to be used. Note that Babel over IPv6
can be used for configuration of both IPv4 and IPv6
routes.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

This document uses a programming-language-like notation to define the
properties of the objects of the information model. An optional property
is enclosed by square brackets, \[ \], and a list property is indicated
by two numbers in angle brackets, \<m..n>, where m indicates the minimal
number of list elements, and n indicates the maximum number of list
elements. The symbol \"\*\" for n means there are no defined limits on
the number of list elements. Each parameter and object includes an
indication of \"ro\" or \"rw\". \"ro\" means the parameter or object is
read-only. \"rw\" means it is read-write. For an object, read-write
means instances of the object can be created or deleted. If an
implementation is allowed to choose to implement a \"rw\" parameter as
read-only, this is noted in the parameter
description.[¶](#section-1.2-1){.pilcrow}

The object definitions use base types that are defined as
follows:[¶](#section-1.2-2){.pilcrow}

:   A binary string (sequence of
    octets).[¶](#section-1.2-3.2.1){.pilcrow}

## [5.](#section-5){.section-number .selfRef} [Security Considerations](#name-security-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-security-considerations}

This document defines a set of information model objects and parameters
that may be exposed and visible from other devices. Some of these
information model objects and parameters may be configured. Securing
access to and ensuring the integrity of this data is in scope of and the
responsibility of any data model derived from this information model.
Specifically, any YANG \[[RFC7950](#RFC7950){.xref}\] data model is
expected to define security exposure of the various parameters, and a
\[[TR-181](#TR-181){.xref}\] data model will be secured by the
mechanisms defined for the management protocol used to transport
it.[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

Misconfiguration (whether unintentional or malicious) can prevent
reachability or cause poor network performance (increased latency,
jitter, etc.). Misconfiguration of security credentials can cause a
denial-of-service condition for the Babel routing protocol. The
information in this model discloses network topology, which can be used
to mount subsequent attacks on traffic traversing the
network.[¶](#section-5-2){.pilcrow}

This information model defines objects that can allow credentials (for
this device, for trusted devices, and for trusted certificate
authorities) to be added and deleted. Public keys may be exposed through
this model. This model requires that private keys and MAC keys never be
exposed. Certificates used by \[[RFC8968](#RFC8968){.xref}\]
implementations use separate parameters to model the public parts
(including the public key) and the private
key.[¶](#section-5-3){.pilcrow}

MAC keys are allowed to be as short as zero length. This is useful for
testing. It is [RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14} that network operators follow
current best practices for key length and generation of keys related to
the MAC algorithm associated with the key. Short (and zero-length) keys
are highly susceptible to brute-force attacks and therefore [SHOULD
NOT]{.bcp14} be used. See the security considerations as described in
[Section 7](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8967#section-7){.relref}
of \[[RFC8967](#RFC8967){.xref}\] for additional considerations related
to MAC keys; note that there are some specific key value recommendations
in the fifth paragraph. It says that if it is necessary to derive keys
from a human-readable passphrase, \"only the derived keys should be
communicated to the routers\" and \"the original passphrase itself
should be kept on the host used to perform the key generation\" (which
would be the management system in the case of a remote management
protocol). It also recommends that keys \"should have a length of 32
octets (both for HMAC-SHA256 and BLAKE2s), and be chosen
randomly\".[¶](#section-5-4){.pilcrow}

This information model uses key sets and certification sets to provide a
means of grouping keys and certificates. This makes it easy to use a
different set per interface, use the same set for one or more
interfaces, have a default set in case a new interface is instantiated,
and change keys and certificates as needed.[¶](#section-5-5){.pilcrow}
