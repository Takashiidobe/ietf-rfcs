Several years of deployment and implementation experience with the OAuth
2.0 Authorization Framework \[[RFC6749](#RFC6749){.xref}\] has uncovered
a need (in some circumstances, such as an authorization server servicing
a significant number of diverse resources) for the client to explicitly
signal to the authorization server where it intends to use the access
token it is requesting.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

Knowing the protected resource (a.k.a. resource server, application,
API, etc.) that will process the access token enables the authorization
server to construct the token as necessary for that entity. Properly
encrypting the token (or content within the token) to a particular
resource, for example, requires knowing which resource will receive and
decrypt the token. Furthermore, various resources oftentimes have
different requirements with respect to the data contained in (or
referenced by) the token, and knowing the resource where the client
intends to use the token allows the authorization server to mint the
token accordingly.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

Specific knowledge of the intended recipient(s) of the access token also
helps facilitate improved security characteristics of the token itself.
Bearer tokens, currently the most commonly utilized type of OAuth access
token, allow any party in possession of a token to get access to the
associated resources. To prevent misuse, several important security
assumptions must hold, one of which is that an access token must only be
valid for use at a specific protected resource and for a specific scope
of access. [Section
5.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6750#section-5.2){.relref} of
\[[RFC6750](#RFC6750){.xref}\], for example, prescribes including the
token\'s intended recipients within the token to prevent token redirect.
When the authorization server is informed of the resource that will
process the access token, it can restrict the intended audience of that
token to the given resource such that the token cannot be used
successfully at other resources.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

OAuth scope, from [Section
3.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749#section-3.3){.relref} of
\[[RFC6749](#RFC6749){.xref}\], is sometimes overloaded to convey the
location or identity of the protected resource, however, doing so isn\'t
always feasible or desirable. Scope is typically about what access is
being requested rather than where that access will be redeemed (e.g.,
`email`, `admin:org`, `user_photos`, `channels:read`, and
`channels:write` are a small sample of scope values in use in the wild
that convey only the type of access and not the location or
identity).[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

In some circumstances and for some deployments, a means for the client
to signal to the authorization server where it intends to use the access
token it\'s requesting is important and useful. A number of
implementations and deployments of OAuth 2.0 have already employed
proprietary parameters toward that end. Going forward, this
specification aspires to provide a standardized and interoperable
alternative to the proprietary approaches.[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}

## [2.](#section-2){.section-number .selfRef} [Resource Parameter](#name-resource-parameter){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-resource-parameter}

In requests to the authorization server, a client [MAY]{.bcp14} indicate
the protected resource (a.k.a. resource server, application, API, etc.)
to which it is requesting access by including the following parameter in
the request.[¶](#section-2-1){.pilcrow}

resource
:   Indicates the target service or resource to which access is being
    requested. Its value [MUST]{.bcp14} be an absolute URI, as specified
    by [Section
    4.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986#section-4.3){.relref} of
    \[[RFC3986](#RFC3986){.xref}\]. The URI [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} include a
    fragment component. It [SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} include a query
    component, but it is recognized that there are cases that make a
    query component a useful and necessary part of the resource
    parameter, such as when one or more query parameters are used to
    scope requests to an application. The `resource` parameter URI value
    is an identifier representing the identity of the resource, which
    [MAY]{.bcp14} be a locator that corresponds to a network-addressable
    location where the target resource is hosted. Multiple `resource`
    parameters [MAY]{.bcp14} be used to indicate that the requested
    token is intended to be used at multiple
    resources.[¶](#section-2-2.2){.pilcrow}

The parameter value identifies a resource to which the client is
requesting access. The parameter can carry the location of a protected
resource, typically as an https URL or a more abstract identifier. This
enables the authorization server to apply policy as appropriate for the
resource, such as determining the type and content of tokens to be
issued, if and how tokens are encrypted, and applying appropriate
audience restrictions.[¶](#section-2-3){.pilcrow}

The client [SHOULD]{.bcp14} provide the most specific URI that it can
for the complete API or set of resources it intends to access. In
practice, a client will know a base URI for the application or resource
that it interacts with, which is appropriate to use as the value of the
`resource` parameter. The client [SHOULD]{.bcp14} use the base URI of
the API as the `resource` parameter value unless specific knowledge of
the resource dictates otherwise. For example, the value
`https://api.example.com/` would be used for a resource that is the
exclusive application on that host; however, if the resource is one of
many applications on that host, something like
`https://api.example.com/app/` would be used as a more specific value.
Another example is when an API has multiple endpoints, e.g., when System
for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM)
\[[RFC7644](#RFC7644){.xref}\] has endpoints such as
`https://apps.example.com/scim/Users`,
`https://apps.example.com/scim/Groups`, and
`https://apps.example.com/scim/Schemas`. The client would use
`https://apps.example.com/scim/` as the resource so that the issued
access token is valid for all the endpoints of the SCIM
API.[¶](#section-2-4){.pilcrow}

The following error code is provided for an authorization server to
indicate problems with the requested resource(s) in response to an
authorization request or access token request. It can also be used to
inform the client that it has requested an invalid combination of
resource and scope.[¶](#section-2-5){.pilcrow}

invalid_target
:   The requested resource is invalid, missing, unknown, or
    malformed.[¶](#section-2-6.2){.pilcrow}

The authorization server [SHOULD]{.bcp14} audience-restrict issued
access tokens to the resource(s) indicated by the `resource` parameter.
Audience restrictions can be communicated in JSON Web Tokens
\[[RFC7519](#RFC7519){.xref}\] with the `aud` claim and the top-level
member of the same name provides the audience restriction information in
a Token Introspection \[[RFC7662](#RFC7662){.xref}\] response. The
authorization server may use the exact `resource` value as the audience
or it may map from that value to a more general URI or abstract
identifier for the given resource.[¶](#section-2-7){.pilcrow}

::: {#authz-req}
::: {#section-2.1 .section}
### [2.1.](#section-2.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Authorization Request](#name-authorization-request){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-authorization-request}

When the `resource` parameter is used in an authorization request to the
authorization endpoint, it indicates the identity of the protected
resource(s) to which access is being requested. When an access token
will be returned directly from the authorization endpoint via the
implicit flow ([Section
4.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749#section-4.2){.relref} of
OAuth 2.0 \[[RFC6749](#RFC6749){.xref}\]), the requested resource is
applicable to that access token. In the code flow ([Section
4.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749#section-4.1){.relref} of
OAuth 2.0 \[[RFC6749](#RFC6749){.xref}\]) where an intermediate
representation of the authorization grant (the authorization code) is
returned from the authorization endpoint, the requested resource is
applicable to the full authorization grant.[¶](#section-2.1-1){.pilcrow}

For an authorization request sent as a JSON Web Token (JWT), such as
when using the JWT Secured Authorization Request
\[[JWT-SAR](#I-D.ietf-oauth-jwsreq){.xref}\], a single `resource`
parameter value is represented as a JSON string while multiple values
are represented as an array of strings.[¶](#section-2.1-2){.pilcrow}

If the client omits the `resource` parameter when requesting
authorization, the authorization server [MAY]{.bcp14} process the
request with no specific resource or by using a predefined default
resource value. Alternatively, the authorization server [MAY]{.bcp14}
require clients to specify the resource(s) they intend to access and
[MAY]{.bcp14} fail requests that omit the parameter with an
`invalid_target` error. The authorization server might use this data to
inform the user about the resources the client is going to access on
their behalf, to apply policy (e.g., refuse the request due to unknown
resources), and to determine the set of resources that can be used in
subsequent access token requests.[¶](#section-2.1-3){.pilcrow}

If the authorization server fails to parse the provided value(s) or does
not consider the resource(s) acceptable, it should reject the request
with an error response using the error code `invalid_target` as the
value of the `error` parameter and can provide additional information
regarding the reasons for the error using the
`error_description`.[¶](#section-2.1-4){.pilcrow}

An example of an authorization request where the client tells the
authorization server that it wants an access token for use at
`https://api.example.com/app/` is shown in [Figure
1](#authz-endpoint-example-token){.xref} below (extra line breaks and
indentation are for display purposes only).[¶](#section-2.1-5){.pilcrow}

### [2.2.](#section-2.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Access Token Request](#name-access-token-request){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-access-token-request}

When the `resource` parameter is used on an access token request made to
the token endpoint, for all grant types, it indicates the target service
or protected resource where the client intends to use the requested
access token.[¶](#section-2.2-1){.pilcrow}

The resource value(s) that is acceptable to an authorization server in
fulfilling an access token request is at its sole discretion based on
local policy or configuration. In the case of a `refresh_token` or
`authorization_code` grant type request, such policy may limit the
acceptable resources to those that were originally granted by the
resource owner or a subset thereof. In the `authorization_code` case
where the requested resources are a subset of the set of resources
originally granted, the authorization server will issue an access token
based on that subset of requested resources, whereas any refresh token
that is returned is bound to the full original
grant.[¶](#section-2.2-2){.pilcrow}

When requesting a token, the client can indicate the desired target
service(s) where it intends to use that token by way of the `resource`
parameter and can indicate the desired scope of the requested token
using the `scope` parameter. The semantics of such a request are that
the client is asking for a token with the requested scope that is usable
at all the requested target services. Effectively, the requested access
rights of the token are the cartesian product of all the scopes at all
the target services. To the extent possible, when issuing access tokens,
the authorization server should downscope the scope value associated
with an access token to the value the respective resource is able to
process and needs to know. (Here, \"downscope\" means give fewer
permissions than originally authorized by the resource owner.) This
further improves privacy as a list of scope values is an indication that
the resource owner uses the multiple various services listed;
downscoping a token to only that which is needed for a particular
service can limit the extent to which such information is revealed
across different services. As specified in [Section
5.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749#section-5.1){.relref} of
\[[RFC6749](#RFC6749){.xref}\], the authorization server must indicate
the access token\'s effective scope to the client in the `scope`
response parameter value when it differs from the scope requested by the
client.[¶](#section-2.2-3){.pilcrow}

Following from the code flow authorization request shown in [Figure
2](#authz-endpoint-example-code){.xref}, the below examples show an
`authorization_code` grant type access token request ([Figure
3](#token-endpoint-example-ac){.xref}) and response ([Figure
4](#response-example-ac){.xref}) where the client tells the
authorization server that it wants the access token for use at
`https://cal.example.com/` (extra line breaks and indentation are for

An audience-restricted access token that is legitimately presented to a
resource cannot then be taken by that resource and presented elsewhere
for illegitimate access to other resources. The `resource` parameter
enables a client to indicate the protected resources where the requested
access token will be used, which in turn enables the authorization
server to apply the appropriate audience restrictions to the
token.[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

Some servers may host user content or be multi-tenant. In order to avoid
attacks where one tenant uses an access token to illegitimately access
resources owned by a different tenant, it is important to use a specific
resource URI including any portion of the URI that identifies the
tenant, such as a path component. This will allow access tokens to be
audience-restricted in a way that identifies the tenant and prevents
their use, due to an invalid audience, at resources owned by a different
tenant.[¶](#section-3-2){.pilcrow}

Although multiple occurrences of the `resource` parameter may be
included in a token request, using only a single `resource` parameter is
encouraged. If a bearer token has multiple intended recipients
(audiences), then the token is valid at more than one protected resource
and can be used by any one of those resources to access any of the
others. Thus, a high degree of trust between the involved parties is
needed when using access tokens with multiple audiences. Furthermore, an
authorization server may be unwilling or unable to fulfill a token
request with multiple resources.[¶](#section-3-3){.pilcrow}

Whenever feasible, the `resource` parameter should correspond to the
network-addressable location of the protected resource. This makes it
possible for the client to validate that the resource being requested
controls the corresponding network location, reducing the risk of
malicious endpoints obtaining tokens meant for other resources. If the
`resource` parameter contains an abstract identifier, it is the
client\'s responsibility to validate out of band that any network
endpoint to which tokens are sent are the intended audience for that
identifier.[¶](#section-3-4){.pilcrow}

In typical OAuth deployments the authorization sever is in a position to
observe and track a significant amount of user and client behavior. It
is largely just inherent to the nature of OAuth, and this document does
little to affect that. In some cases, however, such as when access token
introspection is not being used, use of the resource parameter defined
herein may allow for tracking behavior at a somewhat more granular and
specific level than would otherwise be possible in its
absence.[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}
