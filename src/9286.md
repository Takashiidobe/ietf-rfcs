# RFC 9286 {#rfcnum}

# Manifests for the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

This document defines a \"manifest\" for use in the Resource Public Key
Infrastructure (RPKI). A manifest is a signed object (file) that
contains a listing of all the signed objects (files) in the repository
publication point (directory) associated with an authority responsible
for publishing in the repository. For each certificate, Certificate
Revocation List (CRL), or other type of signed objects issued by the
authority that are published at this repository publication point, the
manifest contains both the name of the file containing the object and a
hash of the file content. Manifests are intended to enable a relying
party (RP) to detect certain forms of attacks against a repository.
Specifically, if an RP checks a manifest\'s contents against the signed
objects retrieved from a repository publication point, then the RP can
detect replay attacks, and unauthorized in-flight modification or
deletion of signed objects. This document obsoletes RFC
6486.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

The Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI)
\[[RFC6480](#RFC6480){.xref}\] makes use of a distributed repository
system \[[RFC6481](#RFC6481){.xref}\] to make available a variety of
objects needed by relying parties (RPs). Because all of the objects
stored in the repository system are digitally signed by the entities
that created them, attacks that modify these published objects are
detectable by RPs. However, digital signatures alone provide no
protection against attacks that substitute \"stale\" versions of signed
objects (i.e., objects that were valid and have not yet expired, but
have since been superseded), or in-flight attacks that remove an object
that should be present in the repository. To assist in the detection of
such attacks, RPKI repository systems make use of a signed object called
a \"manifest\".[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

A manifest is a signed object that enumerates all the signed objects
(files) in the repository publication point (directory) that are
associated with an authority responsible for publishing at that
publication point. Each manifest contains both the name of the file
containing the object and a hash of the file content, for every signed
object issued by an authority that is published at the authority\'s
repository publication point. A manifest is intended to allow an RP to
detect unauthorized object removal or the substitution of stale versions
of objects at a publication point. A manifest also is intended to allow
an RP to detect similar outcomes that may result from an on-path attack
during the retrieval of objects from the repository. Manifests are
intended to be used in Certification Authority (CA) publication points
in repositories (directories containing files that are subordinate
certificates and Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) issued by this CA
and other signed objects that are verified by End-Entity (EE)
certificates issued by this CA).[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

Manifests are modeled on CRLs, as the issues involved in detecting stale
manifests and potential attacks using manifest replays, etc., are
similar to those for CRLs. The syntax of the manifest payload differs
from CRLs, since RPKI repositories contain objects not covered by CRLs,
e.g., digitally signed objects, such as Route Origin Authorizations
(ROAs) \[[RFC6482](#RFC6482){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

A manifest associated with a CA\'s repository publication point contains
a list of:[¶](#section-2-1){.pilcrow}

-   [the set of (non-expired, non-revoked) certificates issued and
    published by this CA,[¶](#section-2-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-2-2.1}
-   [the most recent CRL issued by this CA,
    and[¶](#section-2-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-2-2.2}
-   [all published signed objects that are verifiable using EE
    certificates \[[RFC6487](#RFC6487){.xref}\] issued by this CA (other
    than the manifest
    itself).[¶](#section-2-2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-2-2.3}

Every RPKI signed object includes, in the Cryptographic Message Syntax
(CMS) \[[RFC5652](#RFC5652){.xref}\] wrapper of the object, the EE
certificate used to verify it \[[RFC6488](#RFC6488){.xref}\]. Thus,
there is no requirement to separately publish that EE certificate at the
CA\'s repository publication point.[¶](#section-2-3){.pilcrow}

Where multiple CA instances share a common publication point, as can
occur when a CA performs a key-rollover operation
\[[RFC6489](#RFC6489){.xref}\], the repository publication point will
contain multiple manifests. In this case, each manifest describes only
the collection of published products of its associated CA
instance.[¶](#section-2-4){.pilcrow}

A CA\'s manifest is verified using an EE certificate. The
SubjectInfoAccess (SIA) field of this EE certificate contains the
accessMethod Object Identifier (OID) of
id-ad-signedObject.[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

The CA [MUST]{.bcp14} sign only one manifest with each generated private
key and [MUST]{.bcp14} generate a new key pair for each new version of
the manifest. An associated EE certificate used in this fashion is
termed a \"one-time-use\" EE certificate (see [Section
3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6487#section-3){.relref} of
\[[RFC6487](#RFC6487){.xref}\]).[¶](#section-3-2){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-4.2.1 .section}
#### [4.2.1.](#section-4.2.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Manifest](#name-manifest){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-manifest}

The manifestNumber, thisUpdate, and nextUpdate fields are modeled after
the corresponding fields in X.509 CRLs (see
\[[RFC5280](#RFC5280){.xref}\]). Analogous to CRLs, a manifest is
nominally current until the time specified in nextUpdate or until a
manifest is issued with a greater manifest number, whichever comes
first.[¶](#section-4.2.1-1){.pilcrow}

Because a \"one-time-use\" EE certificate is employed to verify a
manifest, the EE certificate [MUST]{.bcp14} be issued with a validity
period that coincides with the interval from thisUpdate to nextUpdate in
the manifest, to prevent needless growth of the CA\'s
CRL.[¶](#section-4.2.1-2){.pilcrow}

The data elements of the manifest structure are defined as
follows:[¶](#section-4.2.1-3){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

version:
:   The version number of this version of the manifest specification
    [MUST]{.bcp14} be 0.[¶](#section-4.2.1-4.2){.pilcrow}
:   

manifestNumber:

:   This field is an integer that is incremented (by 1) each time a new
    manifest is issued for a given publication point. This field allows
    an RP to detect gaps in a sequence of published
    manifests.[¶](#section-4.2.1-4.4.1){.pilcrow}

    As the manifest is modeled on the CRL specification, the
    manifestNumber is analogous to the CRLNumber, and the guidance in
    \[[RFC5280](#RFC5280){.xref}\] for CRLNumber values is appropriate
    as to the range of number values that can be used for the
    manifestNumber. Manifest numbers can be expected to contain long
    integers. Manifest verifiers [MUST]{.bcp14} be able to process
    number values up to 20 octets. Conforming manifest issuers [MUST
    NOT]{.bcp14} use number values longer than 20 octets. The issuer
    [MUST]{.bcp14} increase the value of this field monotonically for
    each newly generated manifest. Each RP [MUST]{.bcp14} verify that a
    purported \"new\" manifest contains a higher manifestNumber than
    previously validated manifests. If the purported \"new\" manifest
    contains a manifestNumber value equal to or lower than
    manifestNumber values of previously validated manifests, the RP
    [SHOULD]{.bcp14} use locally cached versions of objects, as
    described in [Section
    6.6](#sect-6.6){.xref}.[¶](#section-4.2.1-4.4.2){.pilcrow}

:   

thisUpdate:
:   This field contains the time when the manifest was created. This
    field has the same format constraints as specified in
    \[[RFC5280](#RFC5280){.xref}\] for the CRL field of the same name.
    The issuer [MUST]{.bcp14} ensure that the value of this field is
    more recent than any previously generated manifest. Each RP
    [MUST]{.bcp14} verify that this field value is greater (more recent)
    than the most recent manifest it has validated. If this field in a
    purported \"new\" manifest is smaller (less recent) than previously
    validated manifests, the RP [SHOULD]{.bcp14} use locally cached
    versions of objects, as described in [Section
    6.6](#sect-6.6){.xref}.[¶](#section-4.2.1-4.6){.pilcrow}
:   

nextUpdate:

:   This field contains the time at which the next scheduled manifest
    will be issued. The value of nextUpdate [MUST]{.bcp14} be later than
    the value of thisUpdate. The specification of the GeneralizedTime
    value is the same as required for the thisUpdate
    field.[¶](#section-4.2.1-4.8.1){.pilcrow}

    If the authority alters any of the items that it has published in
    the repository publication point, then the authority [MUST]{.bcp14}
    issue a new manifest. Even if no changes are made to objects at a
    publication point, a new manifest [MUST]{.bcp14} be issued before
    the nextUpdate time. Each manifest encompasses a CRL, and the
    nextUpdate field of the manifest [SHOULD]{.bcp14} match that of the
    CRL\'s nextUpdate field, as the manifest will be reissued when a new
    CRL is published. When a new manifest is issued before the time
    specified in nextUpdate of the current manifest, the CA
    [MUST]{.bcp14} also issue a new CRL that revokes the EE certificate
    corresponding to the old
    manifest.[¶](#section-4.2.1-4.8.2){.pilcrow}

:   

fileHashAlg:
:   This field contains the OID of the hash algorithm used to hash the
    files that the authority has placed into the repository. The hash
    algorithm used [MUST]{.bcp14} conform to the RPKI Algorithms and Key
    Size Profile specification
    \[[RFC7935](#RFC7935){.xref}\].[¶](#section-4.2.1-4.10){.pilcrow}
:   

fileList:
:   This field is a sequence of FileAndHash objects. There is one
    FileAndHash entry for each currently valid signed object that has
    been published by the authority (at this publication point). Each
    FileAndHash is an ordered pair consisting of the name of the file in
    the repository publication point (directory) that contains the
    object in question and a hash of the file\'s
    contents.[¶](#section-4.2.1-4.12){.pilcrow}

1.  [The eContentType in the EncapsulatedContentInfo is id-ad-

For a CA publication point in the RPKI repository system, a CA
[MUST]{.bcp14} perform the following steps to generate a
manifest:[¶](#section-5.1-1){.pilcrow}

1.  [Generate a new key pair for use in a \"one-time-use\" EE
    certificate.[¶](#section-5.1-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.1-2.1}

2.  ::: {#section-5.1-2.2}
    Issue an EE certificate for this key pair. The CA [MUST]{.bcp14}
    revoke the EE certificate used for the manifest being
    replaced.[¶](#section-5.1-2.2.1){.pilcrow}

    This EE certificate [MUST]{.bcp14} have an SIA extension access
    description field with an accessMethod OID value of
    id-ad-signedObject, where the associated accessLocation references
    the publication point of the manifest as an object URL. (RPs are
    required to verify both of these syntactic
    constraints.)[¶](#section-5.1-2.2.2){.pilcrow}

    This EE certificate [MUST]{.bcp14} describe its Internet Number
    Resources (INRs) using the \"inherit\" attribute, rather than an
    explicit description of a resource set (see
    \[[RFC3779](#RFC3779){.xref}\]). (RPs are required to verify
    this.)[¶](#section-5.1-2.2.3){.pilcrow}

    The validity interval of the EE certificate [MUST]{.bcp14} exactly
    match the thisUpdate and nextUpdate times specified in the
    manifest\'s eContent. (An RP [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} consider
    misalignment of the validity interval in and of itself to be an
    error.)[¶](#section-5.1-2.2.4){.pilcrow}

    Construct the manifest content.[¶](#section-5.1-2.4.1){.pilcrow}

    The manifest content is described in [Section
    4.2.1](#sect-4.2.1){.xref}. The manifest\'s fileList includes the
    file name and hash pair for each object issued by this CA that has
    been published at this repository publication point (directory). The
    collection of objects to be included in the manifest includes all
    certificates issued by this CA that are published at the CA\'s
    repository publication point, the most recent CRL issued by the CA,
    and all objects verified by EE certificates that were issued by this
    CA that are published at this repository publication point.
    (Sections [6.1](#sect-6.1){.xref} through [6.5](#sect-6.5){.xref}
    describe the checks that an RP [MUST]{.bcp14} perform in support of
    the manifest content noted here.)[¶](#section-5.1-2.4.2){.pilcrow}

    Note that the manifest does not include a self reference (i.e., its
    own file name and hash), since it would be impossible to compute the
    hash of the manifest itself prior to it being
    signed.[¶](#section-5.1-2.4.3){.pilcrow}

A new manifest [MUST]{.bcp14} be issued and published before the
nextUpdate time.[¶](#section-5.2-1){.pilcrow}

An authority [MUST]{.bcp14} issue a new manifest in conjunction with the
finalization of changes made to objects in the publication point. If any
named objects in the publication point are replaced, the authority
[MUST]{.bcp14} ensure that the file hash for each replaced object is
updated accordingly in the new manifest. Additionally, the authority
[MUST]{.bcp14} revoke the certificate associated with each replaced
object (other than a CRL), if it is not expired. An authority
[MAY]{.bcp14} perform a number of object operations on a publication
repository within the scope of a repository change before issuing a
single manifest that covers all the operations within the scope of this
change. Repository operators [MUST]{.bcp14} implement some form of
repository update procedure that mitigates, to the extent possible, the
risk that RPs that are performing retrieval operations on the repository
are exposed to inconsistent, transient, intermediate states during
updates to the repository publication point (directory) and the
associated manifest.[¶](#section-5.2-2){.pilcrow}

Since the manifest object URL is included in the SIA of issued
certificates, a new manifest [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} invalidate the manifest
object URL of previously issued certificates. This implies that the
manifest\'s publication name in the repository, in the form of an object
URL, is unchanged across manifest generation
cycles.[¶](#section-5.2-3){.pilcrow}

When a CA entity is performing a key rollover, the entity [MAY]{.bcp14}
choose to have two CA instances simultaneously publishing into the same
repository publication point. In this case, there will be one manifest
associated with each active CA instance that is publishing into the
common repository publication point
(directory).[¶](#section-5.2-4){.pilcrow}

## [6.](#section-6){.section-number .selfRef} [Relying Party Processing of Manifests](#name-relying-party-processing-of){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-relying-party-processing-of}

Each RP [MUST]{.bcp14} use the current manifest of a CA to control
addition of listed files to the set of signed objects the RP employs for
validating basic RPKI objects: certificates, ROAs, and CRLs. Any files
not listed on the manifest [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be used for validation of
these objects. However, files not listed on a manifest [MAY]{.bcp14} be
employed to validate other signed objects, if the profile of the object
type explicitly states that such behavior is allowed (or required). Note
that relying on files not listed in a manifest may allow an attacker to
effect substitution attacks against such
objects.[¶](#section-6-1){.pilcrow}

As noted earlier, manifests are designed to allow an RP to detect
manipulation of repository data, errors by a CA or repository manager,
and/or active attacks on the communication channel between an RP and a
repository. Unless all of the files enumerated in a manifest can be
obtained by an RP during a fetch operation, the fetch is considered to
have failed and the RP [MUST]{.bcp14} retry the fetch
later.[¶](#section-6-2){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC6480](#RFC6480){.xref}\] suggests (but does not mandate) that the
RPKI model employ fetches that are incremental, e.g., an RP transfers
files from a publication point only if they are new/changed since the
previous, successful fetch represented in the RP\'s local cache. This
document avoids language that relies on details of the underlying file
transfer mechanism employed by an RP and a publication point to effect
this operation. Thus, the term \"fetch\" refers to an operation that
attempts to acquire the full set of files at a publication point,
consistent with the id-ad-rpkiManifest URI extracted from a CA
certificate\'s SIA (see below).[¶](#section-6-3){.pilcrow}

If a fetch fails, it is assumed that a subsequent fetch will resolve
problems encountered during the fetch. Until such time as a successful
fetch is executed, an RP [SHOULD]{.bcp14} use cached data from a
previous, successful fetch. This response is intended to prevent an RP
from misinterpreting data associated with a publication point and thus
possibly treating invalid routes as valid, or vice
versa.[¶](#section-6-4){.pilcrow}

The processing described below is designed to cause all RPs with access
to the same local cache and RPKI repository data to acquire the same set
of validated repository files. It does not ensure that the RPs will
achieve the same results with regard to validation of RPKI data, since
that depends on how each RP resolves any conflicts that may arise in
processing the retrieved files. Moreover, in operation, different RPs
will access repositories at different times, and some RPs may experience
local cache failures, so there is no guarantee that all RPs will achieve
the same results with regard to acquisition or validation of RPKI
data.[¶](#section-6-5){.pilcrow}

Note also that there is a \"chicken and egg\" relationship between the
manifest and the CRL for a given CA instance. If the EE certificate for
the current manifest is revoked, i.e., it appears in the current CRL,
then the CA or publication point manager has made a serious error. In
this case, the fetch has failed; proceed to [Section
6.6](#sect-6.6){.xref}. Similarly, if the CRL is not listed on a valid,
current manifest, acquired during a fetch, the fetch has failed; proceed
to [Section 6.6](#sect-6.6){.xref}, because the CRL is considered
missing.[¶](#section-6-6){.pilcrow}

For a given publication point, an RP [MUST]{.bcp14} perform a series of
tests to determine which signed object files at the publication point
are acceptable. The tests described below
(Sections [6.2](#sect-6.2){.xref} through [6.5](#sect-6.5){.xref}) are
to be performed using the manifest identified by the id-ad- rpkiManifest
URI extracted from a CA certificate\'s SIA. All of the files referenced
by the manifest [MUST]{.bcp14} be located at the publication point
specified by the id-ad-caRepository URI from the (same) CA
certificate\'s SIA. The manifest and the files it references
[MUST]{.bcp14} reside at the same publication point. If an RP encounters
any files that appear on a manifest but do not reside at the same
publication point as the manifest, the RP [MUST]{.bcp14} treat the fetch
as failed, and a warning [MUST]{.bcp14} be issued (see [Section

Note that, during CA key rollover \[[RFC6489](#RFC6489){.xref}\], signed

## [8.](#section-8){.section-number .selfRef} [Security Considerations](#name-security-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-security-considerations}

Manifests provide an additional level of protection for RPKI RPs.
Manifests can assist an RP in determining if a repository object has
been deleted, occluded, or otherwise removed from view, or if a
publication of a newer version of an object has been suppressed (and an
older version of the object has been
substituted).[¶](#section-8-1){.pilcrow}

Manifests cannot repair the effects of such forms of corruption of
repository retrieval operations. However, a manifest enables an RP to
determine if a locally maintained copy of a repository is a complete and
up-to-date copy, even when the repository retrieval operation is
conducted over an insecure channel. In cases where the manifest and the
retrieved repository contents differ, the manifest can assist in
determining which repository objects form the difference set in terms of
missing, extraneous, or superseded objects.[¶](#section-8-2){.pilcrow}

The signing structure of a manifest and the use of the nextUpdate value
allow an RP to determine if the manifest itself is the subject of
attempted alteration. The requirement for every repository publication
point to contain at least one manifest allows an RP to determine if the
manifest itself has been occluded from view. Such attacks against the
manifest are detectable within the time frame of the regular schedule of
manifest updates. Forms of replay attacks within finer-grained time
frames are not necessarily detectable by the manifest
structure.[¶](#section-8-3){.pilcrow}

## [Appendix B.](#appendix-B){.section-number .selfRef} [Changes since RFC 6486](#name-changes-since-rfc-6486){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-changes-since-rfc-6486}

In 2019, it came to light that multiple RP implementations were in a
vulnerable position, possibly due to perceived ambiguity in the original
\[[RFC6486](#RFC6486){.xref}\] specification. This document attempts to
clarify the innovative concept and application of RPKI manifests in
light of real-world deployment experience in the global Internet routing
system, to avoid future problematic cases.[¶](#appendix-B-1){.pilcrow}

The following list summarizes the changes between RFC 6486 and this
document:[¶](#appendix-B-2){.pilcrow}

-   [Forbidding \"sequential-use\" EE certificates and instead mandating
    \"one-time-use\" EE
    certificates.[¶](#appendix-B-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#appendix-B-3.1}
-   [Clarifying that manifest EE certificates are to be issued with a
    validity period that coincides with the interval specified in the
    manifest eContent, which coincides with the CRL\'s thisUpdate and
    nextUpdate.[¶](#appendix-B-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#appendix-B-3.2}
-   [Clarifying that the manifestNumber is monotonically incremented in
    steps of 1.[¶](#appendix-B-3.3){.pilcrow}]{#appendix-B-3.3}
-   [Recommending that CA issuers include the applicable CRL\'s
    nextUpdate with the manifest\'s
    nextUpdate.[¶](#appendix-B-3.4){.pilcrow}]{#appendix-B-3.4}
-   [Constraining the set of valid characters in FileAndHash file
    names.[¶](#appendix-B-3.5){.pilcrow}]{#appendix-B-3.5}
-   [Clarifying that an RP unable to obtain the full set of files listed
    on a manifest is considered to be in a failure state, in which case
    cached data from a previous attempt should be used (if
    available).[¶](#appendix-B-3.6){.pilcrow}]{#appendix-B-3.6}
-   [Clarifying the requirement for a current CRL to be present, listed,
    and verified.[¶](#appendix-B-3.7){.pilcrow}]{#appendix-B-3.7}
-   [Removing the notion of \"local
    policy\".[¶](#appendix-B-3.8){.pilcrow}]{#appendix-B-3.8}
