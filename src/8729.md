# RFC 8729 {#rfcnum}

# The RFC Series and RFC Editor {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

This document describes the framework for an RFC Series and an RFC
Editor function that incorporate the principles of organized community
involvement and accountability that has become necessary as the Internet
technical community has grown, thereby enabling the RFC Series to
continue to fulfill its mandate. This document obsoletes RFC
4844.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

The first Request for Comments (RFC) document was published in April of
1969 as part of the effort to design and build what we now know of as
the Internet. Since then, the RFC Series has been the archival series
dedicated to documenting Internet technical specifications, including
both general contributions from the Internet research and engineering
community as well as standards documents.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

As described in the history of the first 30 years of RFCs
(\[[RFC2555](#RFC2555){.xref}\]), the RFC Series was created for the
purpose of capturing the research and engineering thought that underlie
the design of (what we now know of as) the Internet. As the Internet
Engineering Task Force (IETF) was formalized to carry out the discussion
and documentation of Internet standards, IETF documents have become a
large part (but not the entirety) of the RFC
Series.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

As the IETF has grown up and celebrated its own 30 years of history, its
requirements for archival publication of its output have changed and
become more rigorous. Perhaps most significantly, the IETF must be able
to define (based on its own open consensus discussion processes and
leadership directions) and implement adjustments to its publication
processes.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

At the same time, the Internet engineering and research community as a
whole has grown and come to require more openness and accountability in
all organizations supporting it. More than ever, this community needs an
RFC Series that is supported (operationally and in terms of its
principles) such that there is a balance of:[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

-   [expert
    implementation;[¶](#section-1-5.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-5.1}
-   [clear management and direction \-- for operations and evolution
    across the whole RFC Series (whether originating in the IETF or
    not); and[¶](#section-1-5.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-5.2}
-   [appropriate community input into and review of
    activities.[¶](#section-1-5.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-5.3}

In the past, there has been confusion and therefore sometimes tension
over where and how to address RFC issues that are particular to
contributing groups (e.g., the IETF, the Internet Architecture Board
(IAB), or independent individuals). It was not always clear where there
should be community involvement versus RFC Editor control; depending on
the issue, there might be more or less involvement from the IAB, the
Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG), or the community at large.
There are similar issues with handling RFC Series-wide issues \-- where
to discuss and resolve them in a way that is balanced across the whole
series.[¶](#section-1-6){.pilcrow}

For example, there have been discussions about Intellectual Property
Rights (IPR) for IETF-generated documents, but it\'s not clear when or
how to abstract the portions of those discussions that are relevant to
the rest of the RFC Series. Discussions of labeling (of RFCs in general,
IETF documents in particular, or some combination thereof) generally
must be applied to the whole RFC Series or not at all. Without an
agreed-on framework for managing the RFC Series, it is difficult to have
those discussions in a non-polarized fashion \-- either the IETF
dictating the reality of the rest of the RFC Series, or the RFC Series
imposing undue restrictions on documents from the
IETF.[¶](#section-1-7){.pilcrow}

As part of its charter (see [Appendix A](#iabcharterhistory){.xref}),
the IAB has a responsibility for the RFC Editor. Acknowledging the
IETF\'s needs and the general Internet engineering and research
community\'s evolving needs, the IAB supports a future for the RFC
Series that continues to meet its original mandate of providing the
archival series for the technical research and engineering documentation
that describes the Internet.[¶](#section-1-8){.pilcrow}

With this document, the IAB provides the framework for the RFC Series
and an RFC Editor function with the specific purpose of ensuring that
the RFC Series is maintained and supported in ways that are consistent
with the stated purpose of the RFC Series and the realities of today\'s
Internet research and engineering community. The framework describes the
existing \"streams\" of RFCs, draws a roadmap of existing process
documents already defining the implementation, and provides clear
direction of how to evolve this framework and its supporting pieces
through discussion and future document
revision.[¶](#section-1-9){.pilcrow}

Specifically, this document provides a brief charter for the RFC Series,
describes the role of the RFC Editor, the IAB, and the IETF
Administrative Support Activity (IASA) in a framework for managing the
RFC Series, and discusses the streams of input to the RFC Series from
the various constituencies it serves.[¶](#section-1-10){.pilcrow}

The RFC Series is the archival series dedicated to documenting Internet
technical specifications, including general contributions from the
Internet research and engineering community as well as standards
documents.[¶](#section-2-1){.pilcrow}

RFCs are available free of charge to anyone via the

mission, this section reviews the updated roles and responsibilities of
the entities that have had, and will have, involvement in continued

::: {#section-3.1 .section}
### [3.1.](#section-3.1){.section-number .selfRef} [RFC Editor](#name-rfc-editor){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-rfc-editor}

Originally, there was a single person acting as editor of the RFC Series
(the RFC Editor). The task has grown, and the work now requires the
organized activity of several experts, so there are RFC Editors, or an
RFC Editor organization. In time, there may be multiple organizations
working together to undertake the work required by the RFC Series. For
simplicity\'s sake, and without attempting to predict how the role might
be subdivided among them, this document refers to this collection of
experts and organizations as the \"RFC
Editor\".[¶](#section-3.1-1){.pilcrow}

The RFC Editor is an expert technical editor and series editor, acting
to support the mission of the RFC Series. As such, the RFC Editor is the
implementer handling the editorial management of the RFC Series, in
accordance with the defined processes. In addition, the RFC Editor is
expected to be the expert and prime mover in discussions about policies
for editing, publishing, and archiving

In this model, the role of the IAB is to ensure that the RFC Series
mission is being appropriately fulfilled for the whole community for
which it was created. The IAB does not, organizationally, have
comprehensive publishing or editorial expertise. Therefore, the role of
the IAB is focused on ensuring that principles are met, the appropriate
bodies and communities are duly informed and consulted, and the RFC
Editor has what it needs in order to execute on the material that is in
their mandate.[¶](#section-3.2-1){.pilcrow}

It is the responsibility of the IAB to approve the appointment of the
RFC Editor and to approve the general policy followed by the RFC

The IETF Administration Limited Liability Company (IETF LLC), as part of
the IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA), is responsible for
administrative and financial matters for the IETF, the IAB, and the
Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) \[[RFC8711](#RFC8711){.xref}\]. The
IASA is tasked with providing the funding for the RFC Editor. The IASA,
through the IETF Executive Director, provides contractual and financial
oversight of the RFC Editor. Additionally, as described in [Section
3.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8728#section-3.1){.relref} of
\[[RFC8728](#RFC8728){.xref}\], the RFC Series Oversight Committee
(RSOC), acting with authority delegated from the IAB, is responsible for
ensuring that the RFC Series is run in a transparent and accountable
manner, including design and execution of the RFC Series Editor
selection process.[¶](#section-3.3-1){.pilcrow}

The IETF Executive Director works with the IAB to identify suitable
persons or entities to fulfill the mandate of the RFC Production Center
and the RFC Publisher roles as defined in
\[[RFC8728](#RFC8728){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3.3-2){.pilcrow}

The IETF Executive Director establishes appropriate contractual
agreements with the selected persons or entities to carry out the work
that will satisfy the technical publication requirements defined for the
various RFC input streams (see [Section 5.2](#reqs){.xref}). The IETF
Executive Director may define additional operational requirements and
policies for management purposes to meet the requirements defined by the
various communities.[¶](#section-3.3-3){.pilcrow}

The IETF Administration LLC Board approves a budget for operation of the

The IAB monitors the effectiveness of the policies in force and their
implementation to ensure that the RFC Editor activity meets the
editorial management and document publication needs as referenced in
this document. In the event of serious non-conformance, the IAB, either
on its own initiative or at the request of the IETF Administration LLC

With the RFC Series mission outlined above, this document describes a
framework for supporting[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

-   [the operational implementation of the RFC
    Series,[¶](#section-4-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-4-2.1}

based on[¶](#section-4-3){.pilcrow}

for which there are[¶](#section-4-5){.pilcrow}

-   [clear responsibilities and mechanisms for update and
    change.[¶](#section-4-6.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-4-6.1}

Generally speaking, the RFC Editor is responsible for the operational
implementation of the RFC Series. As outlined in [Section
3.3](#ops){.xref}, the IETF Executive Director provides the oversight of
this operational role.[¶](#section-4-7){.pilcrow}

The process and definition documents are detailed below, including
responsibility for the individual process documents (maintenance and
update). The RFC Editor works with the appropriate community to ensure
that the process documents reflect current requirements. The IAB is
charged with the role of verifying that appropriate community input has
been sought and that any changes appropriately account for community
requirements.[¶](#section-4-8){.pilcrow}

There are three categories of activity, and a fourth category of
series-wide rules and guidelines, described for implementing the RFC
Series to support its mission:[¶](#section-4-9){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-4.1.1 .section}
#### [4.1.1.](#section-4.1.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Definition](#name-definition){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-definition}

[Section 5.1](#approval){.xref} describes the different streams of
documents that are put to the RFC Editor for publication as RFCs today.
While there may be general policies for approval of documents as RFCs
(to ensure the coherence of the RFC Series), there are also policies
defined for the approval of documents in each stream. Generally
speaking, there is a different approving body for each stream. The
current definitions are catalogued in [Section
5.1](#approval){.xref}.[¶](#section-4.1.1-1){.pilcrow}

#### [4.1.2.](#section-4.1.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Operational Implementation](#name-operational-implementation){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-operational-implementation}

Each stream has its own documented approval process. The RFC Editor is
responsible for the approval of documents in one of the streams
(Independent Submission stream, see [Section
5.1.4](#independent-approval){.xref}) and works with the other approving
bodies to ensure smooth passage of approved documents into the next
phases, ultimately to publication and archiving as an
RFC.[¶](#section-4.1.2-1){.pilcrow}

#### [4.1.3.](#section-4.1.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Process Change](#name-process-change){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-process-change}

From time to time, it may be necessary to change the approval processes
for any given stream, or even add or remove streams. This may occur when
the RFC Editor, the IAB, the body responsible for a given stream of
documents, or the community determines that there are issues to be
resolved in general for RFC approval or for per-stream approval
processes.[¶](#section-4.1.3-1){.pilcrow}

In this framework, the general approach is that the IAB will work with
the RFC Editor and other parties to get community input, and it will
verify that any changes appropriately account for community
requirements.[¶](#section-4.1.3-2){.pilcrow}

Producing and maintaining a coherent, well-edited document series
requires specialized skills and subject matter expertise. This is the
domain of the RFC Editor. Nevertheless, the community served by the RFC
Series and the communities served by the individual streams of RFCs have
requirements that help define the nature of the
series.[¶](#section-4.2-1){.pilcrow}

General and stream-specific requirements for the RFC Series are
documented in community-approved documents (catalogued in [Section
5.2](#reqs){.xref} below).[¶](#section-4.2.1-1){.pilcrow}

Any specific interfaces, numbers, or concrete values required to make
the requirements operational are the subject of agreements between the
IASA and the RFC Editor (e.g., contracts, statements of work, service

#### [4.2.2.](#section-4.2.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Operational Implementation](#name-operational-implementation-2){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-operational-implementation-2}

The RFC Editor is responsible for ensuring that editing, processing, and
publication of RFCs are carried out in a way that is consistent with the
requirements laid out in the appropriate documents. The RFC Editor works
with the IASA to provide regular reporting and feedback on these
operations.[¶](#section-4.2.2-1){.pilcrow}

From time to time, it may be necessary to change the requirements for
any given stream, or the RFC Series in general. This may occur when the
RFC Editor, the IAB, the approval body for a given stream of documents,
or the community determines that there are issues to be resolved in
general for RFCs or for per-stream
requirements.[¶](#section-4.2.3-1){.pilcrow}

The activities of archiving, indexing, and making accessible the RFC
Series can be informed by specific subject matter expertise in general
document series editing. It is also important that they are informed by
requirements from the whole community. As long as the RFC Series is to
remain coherent, there should be uniform archiving and indexing of RFCs
across all streams and a common method of accessing the resulting
documents.[¶](#section-4.3-1){.pilcrow}

the archiving, indexing, and accessibility requirements for the RFC
Series. In practice, we continue with the archive as built by the
capable RFC Editors since the series\'
inception.[¶](#section-4.3.1-1){.pilcrow}

Any specific concrete requirements for the archive, index, and
accessibility operations are the subject of agreements between the IASA

The RFC Series style and content can be shaped by subject matter
expertise in document series editing. They are also informed by

## [5.](#section-5){.section-number .selfRef} [RFC Streams](#name-rfc-streams){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-rfc-streams}

Various contributors provide input to the RFC Series. These contributors
come from several different communities, each with its own defined
process for approving documents that will be published by the RFC
Editor. This is nothing new; however, over time the various communities
and document requirements have grown and separated. In order to promote
harmony in discussing the collective set of requirements, it is useful
to recognize each in their own space \-- and they are referred to here
as \"streams\".[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

Note that by identifying separate streams, there is no intention of
dividing them or undermining their management as one series. Rather, the
opposite is true \-- by clarifying the constituent parts, it is easier
to make them work together without the friction that sometimes arises
when discussing various requirements.[¶](#section-5-2){.pilcrow}

The subsections below identify the streams that exist today. There is no
immediate expectation of new streams being created, and it is preferable
that new streams NOT be created. Creation of streams and all policies

The Internet engineering and research community has not only grown, it
has become more diverse, and sometimes more demanding. The IETF, as a
standards-developing organization, has publication requirements that
extend beyond those of an academic journal. The IAB does not have the
same interdependence with IANA assignments as the IETF stream does.
Therefore, there is the need to both codify the publishing requirements
of each stream, and endeavor to harmonize them to the extent that is
reasonable.[¶](#section-5.2-1){.pilcrow}

Therefore, it is expected that the community of effort behind each
document stream will outline their technical publication
requirements.[¶](#section-5.2-2){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC5744](#RFC5744){.xref}\].[¶](#section-5.2.4-2){.pilcrow}

If the RFC Editor elects to define other requirements, they should
deviate minimally from those (in an effort to keep the collective
technical publication requirements reasonably managed by one technical
publisher).[¶](#section-5.2.4-3){.pilcrow}

The processes for the publication of documents must prevent the
introduction of unapproved changes. Since the RFC Editor maintains the
index of publications, sufficient security must be in place to prevent
these published documents from being changed by external parties. The
archive of RFC documents, any source documents needed to recreate the
RFC documents, and any associated original documents (such as lists of
errata, tools, and, for some early items, non-machine readable
originals) need to be secured against failure of the storage medium and
other similar disasters.[¶](#section-6-1){.pilcrow}

Sections [3.3](#ops){.xref}, [3.4](#policyoversight){.xref}, and
[4](#framework){.xref} have been updated to align with the restructuring
of the IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA). Under the new
structure, the IETF LLC performs the tasks related to IASA that were
previously assigned to the IETF Administrative Director and to the
Internet Society.[¶](#section-7-1){.pilcrow}

Many references were updated to point to the most recent
documents.[¶](#section-7-2){.pilcrow}

Minor editorial changes were made to reflect 10 years of using the
framework provided in RFC 4884. For example, RFC 4844 said, \"\... this
document sets out a revised framework \...\", and it is now more
appropriate to say, \"\... this document sets out the framework
\...\".[¶](#section-7-3){.pilcrow}

appropriately.[¶](#section-appendix.a-1){.pilcrow}

This section provides an overview of the role of the IAB with respect to
the RFC Editor as it has been presented in IAB Charter RFCs dating back
to 1992. The point of this section is that the IAB\'s role has
historically been substantive \-- whether it is supposed to be directly
responsible for the RFC Series\' editorial management (circa 1992,
[Appendix A.1](#circa1992){.xref}), or appointment of the RFC Editor
organization and approval of general policy (circa 2000, [Appendix
A.3](#circa2000){.xref}).[¶](#section-appendix.a-2){.pilcrow}
