## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

This document defines the Subscriber and Performance Policy Identifier
Context Headers. These Variable-Length Context Headers can be carried in
the Network Service Header (NSH) and are used to inform Service
Functions (SFs) of subscriber- and performance-related information for
the sake of policy enforcement and appropriate Service Function Chaining
(SFC) operations. The structure of each Context Header and their use and
processing by NSH-aware nodes are
described.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

This document discusses how to inform Service Functions (SFs)
\[[RFC7665](#RFC7665){.xref}\] about subscriber and service policy
information when required for the sake of policy enforcement within a
single administrative domain. In particular, subscriber-related
information may be required to enforce subscriber-specific SFC-based
traffic policies. However, the information carried in packets may not be
sufficient to unambiguously identify a subscriber. This document fills
this void by specifying a new Network Service Header (NSH)
\[[RFC8300](#RFC8300){.xref}\] Context Header to convey and disseminate
such information within the boundaries of a single administrative
domain. As discussed in [Section 3](#solutions){.xref}, the use of
obfuscated and non-persistent identifiers is
recommended.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

Also, traffic steering by means of SFC may be driven, for example, by
Quality of Service (QoS) considerations. Typically, QoS information may
serve as an input for the computation, establishment, and selection of
the Service Function Path (SFP). Furthermore, the dynamic structuring of
Service Function Chains and their subsequent SFPs may be conditioned by
QoS requirements that will affect the identification, location, and
sequencing of SF instances. Hence, the need arises to provide downstream
SFs with a performance policy identifier in order for them to
appropriately meet the QoS requirements. This document also specifies a
new NSH Context Header ([Section 4](#sol2){.xref}) to convey such policy
identifiers.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

The context information defined in this document can be applicable in
the context of mobile networks (particularly in the 3GPP-defined (S)Gi
interface) \[[CASE-MOBILITY](#I-D.ietf-sfc-use-case-mobility){.xref}\].
Typically, because of the widespread use of private IPv4 addresses in
those networks, if the SFs to be invoked are located after a NAT
function, the identification based on the internal IPv4 address is not
possible once the NAT has been crossed. NAT functionality can reside in
a distinct node. For a 4G 3GPP network, that node can be the Packet Data
Network (PDN) Gateway (PGW) as specified in
\[[TS23401](#TS23401){.xref}\]. For a 5G 3GPP network, it can be the
User Plane Function (UPF) facing the external Data Network (DN)
\[[TS23501](#TS23501){.xref}\]. As such, a mechanism to pass the
internal information past the NAT boundary may optimize packet traversal
within an SFC-enabled mobile network domain. Furthermore, some SFs that
are not enabled on the PGW/UPF may require a subscriber identifier to
properly operate (see, for example, those listed in
\[[RFC8371](#RFC8371){.xref}\]). It is outside the scope of this
document to include a comprehensive list of deployments that may make
use of the Context Headers defined in the
document.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

Since subscriber identifiers are distinct from those used to identify a
performance policy and given that multiple policies may be associated
with a single subscriber within a Service Function Chain, these
identifiers are carried in distinct Context Headers rather than being
multiplexed in one single Context Header. This approach avoids a
requirement for additional internal structure in the Context Headers to
specify whether an identifier refers to a subscriber or to a
policy.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

This document does not make any assumptions about the structure of
subscriber or performance policy identifiers; each such identifier is
treated as an opaque value. The semantics and validation of these
identifiers are policies local to each SFC-enabled domain. This document
focuses on the data plane behavior. Control plane considerations are out
of the scope.[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}

This document adheres to the SFC data plane architecture defined in
\[[RFC7665](#RFC7665){.xref}\]. This document assumes the reader is
familiar with \[[RFC8300](#RFC8300){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-6){.pilcrow}

This document assumes the NSH is used exclusively within a single
administrative domain. This document follows the recommendations in
\[[RFC8300](#RFC8300){.xref}\] for handling the Context Headers at both
ingress and egress SFC boundary nodes (i.e., to strip the entire NSH,
including Context Headers). Revealing any subscriber-related information
to parties outside the SFC-enabled domain is avoided by design.
Accordingly, the scope for privacy breaches and user tracking is limited
to within the SFC-enabled domain where the NSH is used. It is assumed
that appropriate mechanisms to monitor and audit an SFC-enabled domain
to detect misbehavior and to deter misuse are in
place.[¶](#section-1-7){.pilcrow}

MTU considerations are discussed in [Section

Subscriber Identifier:

:   Carries an opaque local identifier that is assigned to a subscriber
    by a network operator.[¶](#section-3-4.10.1){.pilcrow}

    While this document does not specify an internal structure for these
    identifiers, it also does not provide any cryptographic protection
    for them; any internal structure to the identifier values chosen
    will thus be visible on the wire if no secure transport
    encapsulation is used. Accordingly, in alignment with [Section
    8.2.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8300#section-8.2.2){.relref}
    of \[[RFC8300](#RFC8300){.xref}\], identifier values
    [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be obfuscated.[¶](#section-3-4.10.2){.pilcrow}

:   

The Subscriber Identifier Context Header is used by SFs to enforce
per-subscriber policies (e.g., resource quota, customized filtering
profile, accounting). To that aim, network operators may rely on
identifiers that are generated from those used in legacy deployments
(e.g., [Section
3.3](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-sfc-use-case-mobility-09#section-3.3){.relref}
of \[[CASE-MOBILITY](#I-D.ietf-sfc-use-case-mobility){.xref}\]).
Alternatively, network operators may use identifiers that are associated
with customized policy profiles that are preconfigured on SFs using an
out-of-band mechanism. Such a mechanism can be used to rotate the
identifiers, thus allowing for better unlinkability ([Section
3.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6973#section-3.2){.relref} of
\[[RFC6973](#RFC6973){.xref}\]). Such alternative methods may be
suboptimal (e.g., scalability issues induced by maintaining and
processing finer granular profiles) or inadequate for providing some
per-subscriber policies. The assessment of whether a method for defining
a subscriber identifier provides the required functionality and whether
it is compatible with the capabilities of the SFs at the intended
performance level is deployment specific.[¶](#section-3-5){.pilcrow}

The classifier and NSH-aware SFs [MAY]{.bcp14} inject a Subscriber
Identifier Context Header as a function of a local policy. This local
policy should indicate the SFP(s) for which the Subscriber Identifier
Context Header will be added. In order to prevent interoperability
issues, the type and format of the identifiers to be injected in a
Subscriber Identifier Context Header should be configured to nodes
authorized to inject and consume such headers. For example, a node can
be instructed to insert such data following a type/set scheme (e.g.,
node X should inject subscriber ID type Y). Other schemes may be
envisaged.[¶](#section-3-6){.pilcrow}

Failures to inject such headers should be logged locally, while a
notification alarm may be sent to a Control Element. The details of
sending notification alarms (i.e., the parameters affecting the
transmission of the notification alarms) might depend on the nature of
the information in the Context Header. Parameters for sending alarms,
such as frequency, thresholds, and content of the alarm, should be
configurable.[¶](#section-3-7){.pilcrow}

The default behavior of intermediary NSH-aware nodes is to preserve
Subscriber Identifier Context Headers (i.e., the information can be
passed to next-hop NSH-aware nodes), but local policy may require an
intermediary NSH-aware node to strip a Subscriber Identifier Context
Header after processing it.[¶](#section-3-8){.pilcrow}

NSH-aware SFs [MUST]{.bcp14} ignore Context Headers carrying unknown
subscriber identifiers.[¶](#section-3-9){.pilcrow}

Local policies at NSH-aware SFs may require running additional
validation checks on the content of these Context Headers (e.g.,
accepting only some lengths or types). These policies may also indicate
the behavior to be followed by an NSH-aware SF if the validation checks
fail (e.g., removing the Context Header from the packet). These
additional validation checks are deployment specific. If validation
checks fail on a Subscriber Identifier Context Header, an NSH-aware SF
[MUST]{.bcp14} ignore that Context Header. The event should be logged
locally, while a notification alarm may be sent to a Control Element if
the NSH-aware SF is instructed to do so. For example, an SF will discard
Subscriber Identifier Context Headers conveying identifiers in all
formats that are different from the one the SF is instructed to
expect.[¶](#section-3-10){.pilcrow}

Multiple Subscriber Identifier Context Headers [MAY]{.bcp14} be present
in the NSH, each carrying a distinct opaque value but all pointing to
the same subscriber. This may be required, e.g., by policy enforcement
mechanisms in a mobile network where some SFs rely on IP addresses as
subscriber identifiers, while others use non-IP-specific identifiers
such as those listed in \[[RFC8371](#RFC8371){.xref}\] and [Section
3.3.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-sfc-use-case-mobility-09#section-3.3.2){.relref}
of \[[CASE-MOBILITY](#I-D.ietf-sfc-use-case-mobility){.xref}\]. When
multiple Subscriber Identifier Context Headers are present and an SF is
instructed to strip the Subscriber Identifier Context Header, that SF
[MUST]{.bcp14} remove all Subscriber Identifier Context
Headers.[¶](#section-3-11){.pilcrow}

## [4.](#section-4){.section-number .selfRef} [Performance Policy Identifier NSH Variable-Length Context Headers](#name-performance-policy-identifi){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-performance-policy-identifi}

Dedicated service-specific performance identifiers are defined to
differentiate between services that require specific treatment in order
to exhibit a performance characterized by, e.g., ultra-low latency (ULL)
or ultra-high reliability (UHR). Other policies can be considered when
instantiating a Service Function Chain within an SFC-enabled domain.
They are conveyed in the Performance Policy Identifier Context
Header.[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

The Performance Policy Identifier Context Header is inserted in an NSH
packet so that downstream NSH-aware nodes can make use of the
performance information for proper selection of suitably distributed SFC
paths, SF instances, or applicable policy at SFs. Note that the use of
the performance policy identifier is not helpful if the path computation
is centralized and a strict SFP is presented as local policy to SF
Forwarders (SFFs).[¶](#section-4-2){.pilcrow}

The Performance Policy Identifier Context Header allows for the
distributed enforcement of a per-service policy such as requiring an SFP
to only include specific SF instances (e.g., SFs located within the same
Data Center (DC) or those that are exposing the shortest delay from an
SFF). Details of this process are implementation specific. For
illustration purposes, an SFF may retrieve the details of usable SFs
based upon the corresponding performance policy identifier. Typical
criteria for instantiating specific SFs include location, performance,
or proximity considerations. For the particular case of UHR services,
the standby operation of backup capacity or the presence of SFs deployed
in multiple instances may be requested.[¶](#section-4-3){.pilcrow}

In an environment characterized by frequent changes of link and path
behavior (for example, due to variable load or availability caused by
propagation conditions on a wireless link), the SFP may have to be
adapted dynamically by on-the-move SFC path and SF instance
selection.[¶](#section-4-4){.pilcrow}

Performance Policy Identifier is defined as an optional Variable-Length
Context Header. Its structure is shown in [Figure
2](#arch9){.xref}.[¶](#section-4-5){.pilcrow}

The default behavior of intermediary NSH-aware nodes is to preserve such
Context Headers (i.e., the information can be passed to next-hop
NSH-aware nodes), but local policy may require an intermediary NSH-aware
node to strip one Context Header after processing
it.[¶](#section-4-6){.pilcrow}

Multiple Performance Policy Identifier Context Headers [MAY]{.bcp14} be
present in the NSH, each carrying an opaque value for a distinct policy
that needs to be enforced for a flow. Supplying conflicting policies may
complicate the SFP computation and SF instance location. Corresponding
rules to detect conflicting policies may be provided as a local policy
to the NSH-aware nodes. When such conflict is detected by an NSH-aware
node, the default behavior of the node is to discard the packet and send
a notification alarm to a Control Element.[¶](#section-4-7){.pilcrow}

This added information increases the size of the packet to be carried
along an SFP.[¶](#section-5-3){.pilcrow}

Aligned with [Section
5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8300#section-5){.relref} of
\[[RFC8300](#RFC8300){.xref}\], it is [RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14} for network
operators to increase the underlying MTU so that NSH traffic is
forwarded within an SFC-enabled domain without fragmentation. The
available underlying MTU should be taken into account by network
operators when providing SFs with the required Context Headers to be
injected per SFP and the size of the data to be carried in these Context
Headers.[¶](#section-5-4){.pilcrow}

If the underlying MTU cannot be increased to accommodate the NSH
overhead, network operators may rely upon a transport encapsulation
protocol with the required fragmentation handling. The impact of
activating such feature on SFFs should be carefully assessed by network
operators ([Section
5.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7665#section-5.6){.relref} of
\[[RFC7665](#RFC7665){.xref}\]).[¶](#section-5-5){.pilcrow}

When dealing with MTU issues, network operators should consider the
limitations of various transport encapsulations such as those discussed
in

## [7.](#section-7){.section-number .selfRef} [Security Considerations](#name-security-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-security-considerations}

Data plane SFC-related security considerations, including privacy, are
discussed in [Section
6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7665#section-6){.relref} of
\[[RFC7665](#RFC7665){.xref}\] and [Section
8](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8300#section-8){.relref} of
\[[RFC8300](#RFC8300){.xref}\]. In particular, [Section
8.2.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8300#section-8.2.2){.relref} of
\[[RFC8300](#RFC8300){.xref}\] states that attached metadata (i.e.,
Context Headers) should be limited to that necessary for correct
operation of the SFP. [Section
8.2.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8300#section-8.2.2){.relref} of
\[[RFC8300](#RFC8300){.xref}\] indicates that metadata considerations
that operators can take into account when using NSH are discussed in
\[[RFC8165](#RFC8165){.xref}\].[¶](#section-7-1){.pilcrow}

As specified in \[[RFC8300](#RFC8300){.xref}\], means to prevent leaking
privacy-related information outside an SFC-enabled domain are natively
supported by the NSH given that the last SFF of an SFP will
systematically remove the NSH (and therefore the identifiers defined in
this specification) before forwarding a packet exiting the
SFP.[¶](#section-7-2){.pilcrow}

Nodes that are involved in an SFC-enabled domain are assumed to be
trusted ([Section
1.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8300#section-1.1){.relref} of
\[[RFC8300](#RFC8300){.xref}\]). Discussion of means to check that only
authorized nodes are traversed when a packet is crossing an SFC-enabled
domain is out of scope of this document.[¶](#section-7-3){.pilcrow}

Both Subscriber Identifier and Performance Policy Identifier Context
Headers carry opaque data. In particular, the Subscriber Identifier
Context Header is locally assigned by a network provider and can be
generated from some of the information that is already conveyed in the
original packets from a host (e.g., internal IP address) or other
information that is collected from various sources within an SFC-enabled
domain (e.g., line identifier). The structure of the identifiers
conveyed in these Context Headers is communicated only to entitled
NSH-aware nodes. Nevertheless, some structures may be easily inferred
from the headers if trivial structures are used (e.g., IP addresses). As
persistent identifiers facilitate tracking over time, the use of
indirect and non-persistent identification is thus
[RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14}.[¶](#section-7-4){.pilcrow}

Moreover, the presence of multiple Subscriber Identifier Context Headers
in the same NSH allows a misbehaving node from within the SFC-enabled
domain to bind these identifiers to the same subscriber. This can be
used to track that subscriber more effectively. The use of
non-persistent (e.g., regularly randomized) identifiers as well as the
removal of the Subscriber Identifier Context Headers from the NSH by the
last SF making use of such headers soften this issue (see \"data
minimization\" discussed in [Section
3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8165#section-3){.relref} of
\[[RFC8165](#RFC8165){.xref}\]). Such behavior is especially strongly
recommended in case no encryption is enabled.[¶](#section-7-5){.pilcrow}

A misbehaving node from within the SFC-enabled domain may alter the
content of Subscriber Identifier and Performance Policy Identifier
Context Headers, which may lead to service disruption. Such an attack is
not unique to the Context Headers defined in this document; measures
discussed in [Section
8](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8300#section-8){.relref} of
\[[RFC8300](#RFC8300){.xref}\] are to be followed. A mechanism for NSH
integrity is specified in
\[[NSH-INTEGRITY](#I-D.ietf-sfc-nsh-integrity){.xref}\].[¶](#section-7-6){.pilcrow}

If no secure transport encapsulation is enabled, the use of trivial
subscriber identifier structures, together with the presence of specific
SFs in a Service Function Chain, may reveal sensitive information to
every on-path device. Also, operational staff in teams managing these
devices could gain access to such user privacy-affecting data. Such
disclosure can be a violation of legal requirements because such
information should be available to very few network operator personnel.
Furthermore, access to subscriber data usually requires specific access
privilege levels. To maintain that protection, an SF keeping operational
logs should not log the content of Subscriber and Performance Policy
Identifier Context Headers unless the SF actually uses the content of
these headers for its operation. As discussed in [Section
8.2.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8300#section-8.2.2){.relref} of
\[[RFC8300](#RFC8300){.xref}\], subscriber-identifying information
should be obfuscated, and, if an operator deems cryptographic integrity
protection is needed, security features in the transport encapsulation
protocol (such as IPsec) must be used. A mechanism for encrypting
sensitive NSH data is specified in
\[[NSH-INTEGRITY](#I-D.ietf-sfc-nsh-integrity){.xref}\]. This mechanism
can be considered by network operators when enhanced SF-to-SF security
protection of NSH metadata is required (e.g., to protect against
compromised SFFs).[¶](#section-7-7){.pilcrow}

Some events are logged locally with notification alerts sent by
NSH-aware nodes to a Control Element. These events [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be
rate limited.[¶](#section-7-8){.pilcrow}
