# Congestion Control Requirements for Interactive Real-Time Media {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

Congestion control is needed for all data transported across the
Internet, in order to promote fair usage and prevent congestion
collapse. The requirements for interactive, point-to-point real-time
multimedia, which needs low-delay, semi-reliable data delivery, are
different from the requirements for bulk transfer like FTP or bursty
transfers like web pages. Due to an increasing amount of RTP-based
real-time media traffic on the Internet (e.g., with the introduction of
the Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC)), it is especially important to
ensure that this kind of traffic is congestion
controlled.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

This document describes a set of requirements that can be used to
evaluate other congestion control mechanisms in order to figure out
their fitness for this purpose, and in particular to provide a set of
possible requirements for a real-time media congestion avoidance
technique.[¶](#section-abstract-2){.pilcrow}

## [1.](#section-1){.section-number .selfRef} [Introduction](#name-introduction){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-introduction}

Most of today\'s TCP congestion control schemes were developed with a
focus on a use of the Internet for reliable bulk transfer of
non-time-critical data, such as transfer of large files. They have also
been used successfully to govern the reliable transfer of smaller chunks
of data in as short a time as possible, such as when fetching web
pages.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

These algorithms have also been used for transfer of media streams that
are viewed in a non-interactive manner, such as \"streaming\" video,
where having the data ready when the viewer wants it is important, but
the exact timing of the delivery is not.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

When handling real-time interactive media, the requirements are
different. One needs to provide the data continuously, within a very
limited time window (no more delay than hundreds of milliseconds
end-to-end). In addition, the sources of data may be able to adapt the
amount of data that needs sending within fairly wide margins, but they
can be rate limited by the application \-- even not always having data
to send. They may tolerate some amount of packet loss, but since the
data is generated in real time, sending \"future\" data is impossible,
and since it\'s consumed in real time, data delivered late is commonly
useless.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

While the requirements for real-time interactive media differ from the
requirements for the other flow types, these other flow types will be
present in the network. The congestion control algorithm for real-time
interactive media must work properly when these other flow types are
present as cross traffic on the network.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

One particular protocol portfolio being developed for this use case is
WebRTC \[[RFC8825](#RFC8825){.xref}\], where one envisions sending
multiple flows using the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP)
\[[RFC3550](#RFC3550){.xref}\] between two peers, in conjunction with
data flows, all at the same time, without having special arrangements
with the intervening service providers. As RTP does not provide any
congestion control mechanism, a set of circuit breakers, such as those
described in \[[RFC8083](#RFC8083){.xref}\], are required to protect the
network from excessive congestion caused by non-congestion-controlled
flows. When the real-time interactive media is congestion controlled, it
is recommended that the congestion control mechanism operate within the
constraints defined by these circuit breakers when a circuit breaker is
present and that it should not cause congestion collapse when a circuit
breaker is not implemented.[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}

Given that this use case is the focus of this document, use cases
involving non-interactive media such as video streaming and those using
multicast/broadcast-type technologies, are out of
scope.[¶](#section-1-6){.pilcrow}

The terminology defined in \[[RFC8825](#RFC8825){.xref}\] is used in
this memo.[¶](#section-1-7){.pilcrow}

    The congestion control algorithm [MUST]{.bcp14} attempt to provide
    as-low-as-possible-delay transit for interactive real-time traffic
    while still providing a useful amount of bandwidth. There may be
    lower limits on the amount of bandwidth that is useful, but this is
    largely application specific, and the application may be able to
    modify or remove flows in order to allow some useful flows to get
    enough bandwidth. For example, although there might not be enough
    bandwidth for low-latency video+audio, there could be enough for
    audio only.[¶](#section-2-1.1.1){.pilcrow}

    a.  [Jitter (variation in the bitrate over short timescales) is also
        relevant, though moderate amounts of jitter will be absorbed by
        jitter buffers. Transit delay should be considered to track the
        short-term maximums of delay, including
        jitter.[¶](#section-2-1.1.2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-2-1.1.2.1}
    b.  [The algorithm should provide this as-low-as-possible-delay
        transit and minimize self-induced latency even when faced with
        intermediate bottlenecks and competing flows. Competing flows
        may limit what\'s possible to
        achieve.[¶](#section-2-1.1.2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-2-1.1.2.2}
    c.  [The algorithm should be resilient to the effects of events,
        such as routing changes, which may alter or remove bottlenecks
        or change the bandwidth available, especially if there is a
        reduction in available bandwidth or increase in observed delay.
        It is expected that the mechanism reacts quickly to such events
        to avoid delay buildup. In the context of this memo, a \"quick\"
        reaction is on the order of a few RTTs, subject to the
        constraints of the media codec, but is likely within a second.
        Reaction on the next RTT is explicitly not required, since many
        codecs cannot adapt their sending rate that quickly, but at the
        same time a response cannot be arbitrarily
        delayed.[¶](#section-2-1.1.2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-2-1.1.2.3}
    d.  [The algorithm should react quickly to handle both local and
        remote interface changes (e.g., WLAN to 3G data) that may
        radically change the bandwidth available or bottlenecks,
        especially if there is a reduction in available bandwidth or an
        increase in bottleneck delay. It is assumed that an interface
        change can generate a notification to the
        algorithm.[¶](#section-2-1.1.2.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-2-1.1.2.4}
    e.  [The real-time interactive media applications can be rate
        limited. This means the offered loads can be less than the
        available bandwidth at any given moment and may vary
        dramatically over time, including dropping to no load and then
        resuming a high load, such as in a mute/unmute operation. Hence,
        the algorithm must be designed to handle such behavior from a
        media source or application. Note that the reaction time between
        a change in the bandwidth available from the algorithm and a
        change in the offered load is variable, and it may be different
        when increasing versus
        decreasing.[¶](#section-2-1.1.2.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-2-1.1.2.5}
    f.  [The algorithm is required to avoid building up queues when
        competing with short-term bursts of traffic (for example,
        traffic generated by web browsing), which can quickly saturate a
        local-bottleneck router or link but clear quickly. The algorithm
        should also react quickly to regain its previous share of the
        bandwidth when the local bottleneck or link is
        cleared.[¶](#section-2-1.1.2.6){.pilcrow}]{#section-2-1.1.2.6}
    g.  [Similarly, periodic bursty flows such as MPEG DASH
        \[[MPEG_DASH](#MPEG_DASH){.xref}\] or proprietary media
        streaming algorithms may compete in bursts with the algorithm
        and may not be adaptive within a burst. They are often layered
        on top of TCP but use TCP in a bursty manner that can interact
        poorly with competing flows during the bursts. The algorithm
        must not increase the already existing delay buildup during
        those bursts. Note that this competing traffic may be on a
        shared access link, or the traffic burst may cause a shift in
        the location of the bottleneck for the duration of the
        burst.[¶](#section-2-1.1.2.7){.pilcrow}]{#section-2-1.1.2.7}

2.  ::: {#section-2-1.2}
    The algorithm [MUST]{.bcp14} be fair to other flows, both real-time
    flows (such as other instances of itself) and TCP flows, both
    long-lived flows and bursts such as the traffic generated by a
    typical web-browsing session. Note that \"fair\" is a rather
    hard-to-define term. It [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be fair with itself, giving
    a fair share of the bandwidth to multiple flows with similar RTTs,
    and if possible to multiple flows with different
    RTTs.[¶](#section-2-1.2.1){.pilcrow}

    a.  [Existing flows at a bottleneck must also be fair to new flows
        to that bottleneck and must allow new flows to ramp up to a
        useful share of the bottleneck bandwidth as quickly as possible.
        A useful share will depend on the media types involved, total
        bandwidth available, and the user-experience requirements of a
        particular service. Note that relative RTTs may affect the rate
        at which new flows can ramp up to a reasonable

    a.  [The congestion control should prioritize achieving a useful
        share of the bandwidth depending on the media types and total
        available bandwidth over achieving as-low-as-possible transit

    The algorithm [SHOULD]{.bcp14} adapt as quickly as possible to
    initial network conditions at the start of a flow. This
    [SHOULD]{.bcp14} occur whether the initial bandwidth is above or
    below the bottleneck bandwidth.[¶](#section-2-1.4.1){.pilcrow}

    a.  [The algorithm should allow different modes of adaptation; for
        example, the startup adaptation may be faster than adaptation
        later in a flow. It should allow for both slow-start operation
        (adapt up) and history-based startup (start at a point expected
        to be at or below channel bandwidth from historical information,
        which may need to adapt down quickly if the initial guess is
        wrong). Starting too low and/or adapting up too slowly can cause
        a critical point in a personal communication to be poor
        (\"Hello!\"). Starting too high above the available bandwidth
        causes other problems for user experience, so there\'s a tension
        here. Alternative methods to help startup, such as probing
        during setup with dummy data, may be useful in some
        applications; in some cases, there will be a considerable gap in
        time between flow creation and the initial flow of data. Again,
        a flow may need to change adaptation rates due to network
        conditions or changes in the provided flows (such as unmuting or

    a.  [After stream resumption, the algorithm should attempt to
        rapidly regain its previous share of the bandwidth; the

    are multiplexed onto the same ports. This will allow congestion
    control of the set of streams together instead of as multiple
    independent streams. It will also allow better overall bandwidth
    management, faster response to changing conditions, and fairer
    sharing of bandwidth with other network
    users.[¶](#section-2-1.6.1){.pilcrow}

        usage would be with other flows on the same 5-tuple, but there
        may be use in coordinating measurement and control of the local
        link(s). Use of information about previous flows, especially on
        the same 5-tuple, may be useful input to the algorithm,

Among the existing congestion control mechanisms, TCP Friendly Rate
Control (TFRC) \[[RFC5348](#RFC5348){.xref}\] is the one that claims to
be suitable for real-time interactive media. TFRC is an equation-based
congestion control mechanism that provides a reasonably fair share of
bandwidth when competing with TCP flows and offers much lower throughput
variations than TCP. This is achieved by a slower response to the
available bandwidth change than TCP. TFRC is designed to perform best
with applications that have a fixed packet size and do not have a fixed
period between sending packets.[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

TFRC detects loss events and reacts to congestion-caused loss by
reducing its sending rate. It allows applications to increase the
sending rate until loss is observed in the flows. As noted in IAB/IRTF
report \[[RFC7295](#RFC7295){.xref}\], large buffers are available in
the network elements, which introduce additional delay in the
communication. It becomes important to take all possible congestion
indications into consideration. Looking at the current Internet
deployment, TFRC\'s biggest deficiency is that it only considers loss
events as a congestion indication.[¶](#section-3-2){.pilcrow}

A typical real-time interactive communication includes live-encoded
audio and video flow(s). In such a communication scenario, an audio
source typically needs a fixed interval between packets and needs to
vary the segment size of the packets instead of the packet rate in
response to congestion; therefore, it sends smaller packets. A variant
of TFRC, Small-Packet TFRC (TFRC-SP) \[[RFC4828](#RFC4828){.xref}\],
addresses the issues related to such kind of sources. A video source
generally varies video frame sizes, can produce large frames that need
to be further fragmented to fit into path Maximum Transmission Unit
(MTU) size, and has an almost fixed interval between producing frames
under a certain frame rate. TFRC is known to be less optimal when using
such video sources.[¶](#section-3-3){.pilcrow}

There are also some mismatches between TFRC\'s design assumptions and
how the media sources in a typical real-time interactive application
work. TFRC is designed to maintain a smooth sending rate; however, media
sources can change rates in steps for both rate increase and rate
decrease. TFRC can operate in two modes: i) bytes per second and ii)
packets per second, where typical real-time interactive media sources
operate on bit per second. There are also limitations on how quickly the
media sources can adapt to specific sending rates. Modern video encoders
can operate in a mode in which they can vary the output bitrate a lot
depending on the way they are configured, the current scene they are
encoding, and more. Therefore, it is possible that the video source will
not always output at an allowable bitrate. TFRC tries to increase its
sending rate when transmitting at the maximum allowed rate, and it
increases only twice the current transmission rate; hence, it may create
issues when the video sources vary their
bitrates.[¶](#section-3-4){.pilcrow}

Moreover, there are a number of studies on TFRC that show its
limitations, including TFRC\'s unfairness to low statistically
multiplexed links, oscillatory behavior, performance issues in highly
dynamic loss-rate conditions, and more
\[[CH09](#CH09){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3-5){.pilcrow}

Looking at all these deficiencies, it can be concluded that the
requirements for a congestion control mechanism for real-time
interactive media cannot be met by TFRC as defined in the
standard.[¶](#section-3-6){.pilcrow}

An attacker with the ability to delete, delay, or insert messages into
the flow can fake congestion signals, unless they are passed on a
tamper-proof path. Since some possible algorithms depend on the timing
of packet arrival, even a traditional, protected channel does not fully
mitigate such attacks.[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

An attack that reduces bandwidth is not necessarily significant, since
an on-path attacker could break the connection by discarding all
packets. Attacks that increase the perceived available bandwidth are
conceivable and need to be evaluated. Such attacks could result in
starvation of competing flows and permit amplification
attacks.[¶](#section-5-2){.pilcrow}

Algorithm designers should consider the possibility of malicious on-path
attackers.[¶](#section-5-3){.pilcrow}
