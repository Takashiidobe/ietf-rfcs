A security token is a set of information that facilitates the sharing of
identity and security information in heterogeneous environments or
across security domains. Examples of security tokens include JSON Web
Tokens (JWTs) \[[JWT](#RFC7519){.xref}\] and Security Assertion Markup
Language (SAML) 2.0 assertions
\[[OASIS.saml-core-2.0-os](#OASIS.saml-core-2.0-os){.xref}\]. Security
tokens are typically signed to achieve integrity and sometimes also
encrypted to achieve confidentiality. Security tokens are also sometimes
described as assertions, such as in
\[[RFC7521](#RFC7521){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

A Security Token Service (STS) is a service capable of validating
security tokens provided to it and issuing new security tokens in
response, which enables clients to obtain appropriate access credentials
for resources in heterogeneous environments or across security domains.
Web Service clients have used WS-Trust \[[WS-Trust](#WS-Trust){.xref}\]
as the protocol to interact with an STS for token exchange. While
WS-Trust uses XML and SOAP, the trend in modern Web development has been
towards RESTful (Representational State Transfer) patterns and JSON. The
OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework \[[RFC6749](#RFC6749){.xref}\] and
OAuth 2.0 Bearer Tokens \[[RFC6750](#RFC6750){.xref}\] have emerged as
popular standards for authorizing third-party applications\' access to
HTTP and RESTful resources. The conventional OAuth 2.0 interaction
involves the exchange of some representation of resource owner
authorization for an access token, which has proven to be an extremely
useful pattern in practice. However, its input and output are somewhat
too constrained as is to fully accommodate a security token exchange
framework.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

This specification defines a protocol extending OAuth 2.0 that enables
clients to request and obtain security tokens from authorization servers
acting in the role of an STS. Similar to OAuth 2.0, this specification
focuses on client developer simplicity and requires only an HTTP client
and JSON parser, which are nearly universally available in modern
development environments. The STS protocol defined in this specification
is not itself RESTful (an STS doesn\'t lend itself particularly well to
a REST approach) but does utilize communication patterns and data
formats that should be familiar to developers accustomed to working with
RESTful systems.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

A new grant type for a token exchange request and the associated
specific parameters for such a request to the token endpoint are defined
by this specification. A token exchange response is a normal OAuth 2.0
response from the token endpoint with a few additional parameters
defined herein to provide information to the
client.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

The entity that makes the request to exchange tokens is considered the
client in the context of the token exchange interaction. However, that
does not restrict usage of this profile to traditional OAuth clients. An
OAuth resource server, for example, might assume the role of the client
during token exchange in order to trade an access token that it received
in a protected resource request for a new token that is appropriate to
include in a call to a backend service. The new token might be an access
token that is more narrowly scoped for the downstream service or it
could be an entirely different kind of token.[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}

The scope of this specification is limited to the definition of a basic
request-and-response protocol for an STS-style token exchange utilizing
OAuth 2.0. Although a few new JWT claims are defined that enable
delegation semantics to be expressed, the specific syntax, semantics,
and security characteristics of the tokens themselves (both those
presented to the authorization server and those obtained by the client)
are explicitly out of scope, and no requirements are placed on the trust
model in which an implementation might be deployed. Additional profiles
may provide more detailed requirements around the specific nature of the
parties and trust involved, such as whether signing and/or encryption of
tokens is needed or if proof-of-possession-style tokens will be required
or issued. However, such details will often be policy decisions made
with respect to the specific needs of individual deployments and will be
configured or implemented accordingly.[¶](#section-1-6){.pilcrow}

The security tokens obtained may be used in a number of contexts, the
specifics of which are also beyond the scope of this
specification.[¶](#section-1-7){.pilcrow}

::: {#DelegationImpersonation}
::: {#section-1.1 .section}
### [1.1.](#section-1.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Delegation vs. Impersonation Semantics](#name-delegation-vs-impersonation){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-delegation-vs-impersonation}

One common use case for an STS (as alluded to in the previous section)
is to allow a resource server A to make calls to a backend service C on
behalf of the requesting user B. Depending on the local site policy and
authorization infrastructure, it may be desirable for A to use its own
credentials to access C along with an annotation of some form that A is
acting on behalf of B (\"delegation\") or for A to be granted a limited
access credential to C but that continues to identify B as the
authorized entity (\"impersonation\"). Delegation and impersonation can
be useful concepts in other scenarios involving multiple participants as
well.[¶](#section-1.1-1){.pilcrow}

When principal A impersonates principal B, A is given all the rights
that B has within some defined rights context and is indistinguishable
from B in that context. Thus, when principal A impersonates principal B,
then insofar as any entity receiving such a token is concerned, they are
actually dealing with B. It is true that some members of the identity
system might have awareness that impersonation is going on, but it is
not a requirement. For all intents and purposes, when A is impersonating
B, A is B within the context of the rights authorized by the token. A\'s
ability to impersonate B could be limited in scope or time, or even with
a one-time-use restriction, whether via the contents of the token or an
out-of-band mechanism.[¶](#section-1.1-2){.pilcrow}

Delegation semantics are different than impersonation semantics, though
the two are closely related. With delegation semantics, principal A
still has its own identity separate from B, and it is explicitly
understood that while B may have delegated some of its rights to A, any
actions taken are being taken by A representing B. In a sense, A is an
agent for B.[¶](#section-1.1-3){.pilcrow}

Delegation and impersonation are not inclusive of all situations. When a
principal is acting directly on its own behalf, for example, neither
delegation nor impersonation are in play. They are, however, the more
common semantics operating for token exchange and, as such, are given
more direct treatment in this
specification.[¶](#section-1.1-4){.pilcrow}

Delegation semantics are typically expressed in a token by including
information about both the primary subject of the token as well as the
actor to whom that subject has delegated some of its rights. Such a
token is sometimes referred to as a composite token because it is
composed of information about multiple subjects. Typically, in the
request, the `subject_token` represents the identity of the party on
behalf of whom the token is being requested while the `actor_token`
represents the identity of the party to whom the access rights of the
issued token are being delegated. A composite token issued by the
authorization server will contain information about both parties. When
and if a composite token is issued is at the discretion of the
authorization server and applicable policy and
configuration.[¶](#section-1.1-5){.pilcrow}

The specifics of representing a composite token and even whether or not
such a token will be issued depend on the details of the implementation
and the kind of token. The representations of composite tokens that are
not JWTs are beyond the scope of this specification. The `actor_token`
request parameter, however, does provide a means for providing
information about the desired actor, and the JWT `act` claim can provide
a representation of a chain of delegation.[¶](#section-1.1-6){.pilcrow}

### [2.1.](#section-2.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Request](#name-request){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-request}

A client requests a security token by making a token request to the
authorization server\'s token endpoint using the extension grant type
mechanism defined in [Section
4.5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749#section-4.5){.relref} of
\[[RFC6749](#RFC6749){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2.1-1){.pilcrow}

Client authentication to the authorization server is done using the
normal mechanisms provided by OAuth 2.0. [Section
2.3.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749#section-2.3.1){.relref} of
\[[RFC6749](#RFC6749){.xref}\] defines password-based authentication of
the client, however, client authentication is extensible and other
mechanisms are possible. For example, \[[RFC7523](#RFC7523){.xref}\]
defines client authentication using bearer JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)
\[[JWT](#RFC7519){.xref}\]. The supported methods of client
authentication and whether or not to allow unauthenticated or
unidentified clients are deployment decisions that are at the discretion
of the authorization server. Note that omitting client authentication
allows for a compromised token to be leveraged via an STS into other
tokens by anyone possessing the compromised token. Thus, client
authentication allows for additional authorization checks by the STS as
to which entities are permitted to impersonate or receive delegations
from other entities.[¶](#section-2.1-2){.pilcrow}

The client makes a token exchange request to the token endpoint with an
extension grant type using the HTTP `POST` method. The following
parameters are included in the HTTP request entity-body using the
`application/x-www-form-urlencoded` format with a character encoding of
UTF-8 as described in [Appendix
B](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749#appendix-B){.relref} of
\[[RFC6749](#RFC6749){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2.1-3){.pilcrow}

grant_type
:   [REQUIRED]{.bcp14}. The value
    `urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange` indicates that a
    token exchange is being performed.[¶](#section-2.1-4.2){.pilcrow}

resource
:   [OPTIONAL]{.bcp14}. A URI that indicates the target service or
    resource where the client intends to use the requested security
    token. This enables the authorization server to apply policy as
    appropriate for the target, such as determining the type and content
    of the token to be issued or if and how the token is to be
    encrypted. In many cases, a client will not have knowledge of the
    logical organization of the systems with which it interacts and will
    only know a URI of the service where it intends to use the token.
    The `resource` parameter allows the client to indicate to the
    authorization server where it intends to use the issued token by
    providing the location, typically as an https URL, in the token
    exchange request in the same form that will be used to access that
    resource. The authorization server will typically have the
    capability to map from a resource URI value to an appropriate
    policy. The value of the `resource` parameter [MUST]{.bcp14} be an
    absolute URI, as specified by [Section
    4.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986#section-4.3){.relref} of
    \[[RFC3986](#RFC3986){.xref}\], that [MAY]{.bcp14} include a query
    component and [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} include a fragment component.
    Multiple `resource` parameters may be used to indicate that the
    issued token is intended to be used at the multiple resources
    listed. See
    \[[OAUTH-RESOURCE](#I-D.ietf-oauth-resource-indicators){.xref}\] for
    additional background and uses of the `resource`
    parameter.[¶](#section-2.1-4.4){.pilcrow}

audience
:   [OPTIONAL]{.bcp14}. The logical name of the target service where the
    client intends to use the requested security token. This serves a
    purpose similar to the `resource` parameter but with the client
    providing a logical name for the target service. Interpretation of
    the name requires that the value be something that both the client
    and the authorization server understand. An OAuth client identifier,
    a SAML entity identifier
    \[[OASIS.saml-core-2.0-os](#OASIS.saml-core-2.0-os){.xref}\], and an
    OpenID Connect Issuer Identifier
    \[[OpenID.Core](#OpenID.Core){.xref}\] are examples of things that
    might be used as `audience` parameter values. However, `audience`
    values used with a given authorization server must be unique within
    that server to ensure that they are properly interpreted as the
    intended type of value. Multiple `audience` parameters may be used
    to indicate that the issued token is intended to be used at the
    multiple audiences listed. The `audience` and `resource` parameters
    may be used together to indicate multiple target services with a mix
    of logical names and resource URIs.[¶](#section-2.1-4.6){.pilcrow}

scope
:   [OPTIONAL]{.bcp14}. A list of space-delimited, case-sensitive
    strings, as defined in [Section
    3.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749#section-3.3){.relref} of
    \[[RFC6749](#RFC6749){.xref}\], that allow the client to specify the
    desired scope of the requested security token in the context of the
    service or resource where the token will be used. The values and
    associated semantics of scope are service specific and expected to
    be described in the relevant service
    documentation.[¶](#section-2.1-4.8){.pilcrow}

requested_token_type
:   [OPTIONAL]{.bcp14}. An identifier, as described in [Section
    3](#TokenTypeIdentifiers){.xref}, for the type of the requested
    security token. If the requested type is unspecified, the issued
    token type is at the discretion of the authorization server and may
    be dictated by knowledge of the requirements of the service or
    resource indicated by the `resource` or `audience`
    parameter.[¶](#section-2.1-4.10){.pilcrow}

subject_token
:   [REQUIRED]{.bcp14}. A security token that represents the identity of
    the party on behalf of whom the request is being made. Typically,
    the subject of this token will be the subject of the security token
    issued in response to the request.[¶](#section-2.1-4.12){.pilcrow}

subject_token_type
:   [REQUIRED]{.bcp14}. An identifier, as described in [Section
    3](#TokenTypeIdentifiers){.xref}, that indicates the type of the
    security token in the `subject_token`
    parameter.[¶](#section-2.1-4.14){.pilcrow}

actor_token
:   [OPTIONAL]{.bcp14}. A security token that represents the identity of
    the acting party. Typically, this will be the party that is
    authorized to use the requested security token and act on behalf of
    the subject.[¶](#section-2.1-4.16){.pilcrow}

actor_token_type
:   An identifier, as described in [Section
    3](#TokenTypeIdentifiers){.xref}, that indicates the type of the
    security token in the `actor_token` parameter. This is
    [REQUIRED]{.bcp14} when the `actor_token` parameter is present in
    the request but [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be included
    otherwise.[¶](#section-2.1-4.18){.pilcrow}

In processing the request, the authorization server [MUST]{.bcp14}
perform the appropriate validation procedures for the indicated token
type and, if the actor token is present, also perform the appropriate
validation procedures for its indicated token type. The validity
criteria and details of any particular token are beyond the scope of
this document and are specific to the respective type of token and its
content.[¶](#section-2.1-5){.pilcrow}

In the absence of one-time-use or other semantics specific to the token
type, the act of performing a token exchange has no impact on the
validity of the subject token or actor token. Furthermore, the exchange
is a one-time event and does not create a tight linkage between the
input and output tokens, so that (for example) while the expiration time
of the output token may be influenced by that of the input token,
renewal or extension of the input token is not expected to be reflected
in the output token\'s properties. It may still be appropriate or
desirable to propagate token-revocation events. However, doing so is not
a general property of the STS protocol and would be specific to a
particular implementation, token type, or
deployment.[¶](#section-2.1-6){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-2.1.1 .section}
#### [2.1.1.](#section-2.1.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Relationship between Resource, Audience, and Scope](#name-relationship-between-resour){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-relationship-between-resour}

When requesting a token, the client can indicate the desired target
service(s) where it intends to use that token by way of the `audience`
and `resource` parameters as well as indicate the desired scope of the
requested token using the `scope` parameter. The semantics of such a
request are that the client is asking for a token with the requested
scope that is usable at all the requested target services. Effectively,
the requested access rights of the token are the Cartesian product of
all the scopes at all the target
services.[¶](#section-2.1.1-1){.pilcrow}

An authorization server may be unwilling or unable to fulfill any token
request, but the likelihood of an unfulfillable request is significantly
higher when very broad access rights are being solicited. As such, in
the absence of specific knowledge about the relationship of systems in a
deployment, clients should exercise discretion in the breadth of the
access requested, particularly the number of target services. An
authorization server can use the `invalid_target` error code, defined in
[Section 2.2.2](#ErrorResponse){.xref}, to inform a client that it
requested access to too many target services
simultaneously.[¶](#section-2.1.1-2){.pilcrow}

::: {#Response}
::: {#section-2.2 .section}
### [2.2.](#section-2.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Response](#name-response){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-response}

The authorization server responds to a token exchange request with a
normal OAuth 2.0 response from the token endpoint, as specified in
[Section 5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749#section-5){.relref}
of \[[RFC6749](#RFC6749){.xref}\]. Additional details and explanation
are provided in the following subsections.[¶](#section-2.2-1){.pilcrow}

::: {#SuccessfulResponse}
::: {#section-2.2.1 .section}
#### [2.2.1.](#section-2.2.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Successful Response](#name-successful-response){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-successful-response}

If the request is valid and meets all policy and other criteria of the
authorization server, a successful token response is constructed by
adding the following parameters to the entity-body of the HTTP response
using the \"application/json\" media type, as specified by
\[[RFC8259](#RFC8259){.xref}\], and an HTTP 200 status code. The
parameters are serialized into a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)
structure by adding each parameter at the top level. Parameter names and
string values are included as JSON strings. Numerical values are
included as JSON numbers. The order of parameters does not matter and
can vary.[¶](#section-2.2.1-1){.pilcrow}

access_token
:   [REQUIRED]{.bcp14}. The security token issued by the authorization
    server in response to the token exchange request. The `access_token`
    parameter from [Section
    5.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749#section-5.1){.relref} of
    \[[RFC6749](#RFC6749){.xref}\] is used here to carry the requested
    token, which allows this token exchange protocol to use the existing
    OAuth 2.0 request and response constructs defined for the token
    endpoint. The identifier `access_token` is used for historical
    reasons and the issued token need not be an OAuth access
    token.[¶](#section-2.2.1-2.2){.pilcrow}

issued_token_type
:   [REQUIRED]{.bcp14}. An identifier, as described in [Section
    3](#TokenTypeIdentifiers){.xref}, for the representation of the
    issued security token.[¶](#section-2.2.1-2.4){.pilcrow}

token_type
:   [REQUIRED]{.bcp14}. A case-insensitive value specifying the method
    of using the access token issued, as specified in [Section
    7.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749#section-7.1){.relref} of
    \[[RFC6749](#RFC6749){.xref}\]. It provides the client with
    information about how to utilize the access token to access
    protected resources. For example, a value of `Bearer`, as specified
    in \[[RFC6750](#RFC6750){.xref}\], indicates that the issued
    security token is a bearer token and the client can simply present
    it as is without any additional proof of eligibility beyond the
    contents of the token itself. Note that the meaning of this
    parameter is different from the meaning of the `issued_token_type`
    parameter, which declares the representation of the issued security
    token; the term \"token type\" is more typically used to mean the
    structural or syntactical representation of the security token, as
    it is in all `*_token_type` parameters in this specification. If the
    issued token is not an access token or usable as an access token,
    then the `token_type` value `N_A` is used to indicate that an OAuth
    2.0 `token_type` identifier is not applicable in that
    context.[¶](#section-2.2.1-2.6){.pilcrow}

expires_in
:   [RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14}. The validity lifetime, in seconds, of the
    token issued by the authorization server. Oftentimes, the client
    will not have the inclination or capability to inspect the content
    of the token, and this parameter provides a consistent and
    token-type-agnostic indication of how long the token can be expected
    to be valid. For example, the value 1800 denotes that the token will
    expire in thirty minutes from the time the response was
    generated.[¶](#section-2.2.1-2.8){.pilcrow}

scope
:   [OPTIONAL]{.bcp14} if the scope of the issued security token is
    identical to the scope requested by the client; otherwise, it is
    [REQUIRED]{.bcp14}.[¶](#section-2.2.1-2.10){.pilcrow}

refresh_token
:   [OPTIONAL]{.bcp14}. A refresh token will typically not be issued
    when the exchange is of one temporary credential (the subject_token)
    for a different temporary credential (the issued token) for use in
    some other context. A refresh token can be issued in cases where the
    client of the token exchange needs the ability to access a resource
    even when the original credential is no longer valid (e.g.,
    user-not-present or offline scenarios where there is no longer any
    user entertaining an active session with the client). Profiles or
    deployments of this specification should clearly document the
    conditions under which a client should expect a refresh token in
    response to `urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange` grant
    type requests.[¶](#section-2.2.1-2.12){.pilcrow}

If the request itself is not valid or if either the `subject_token` or
`actor_token` are invalid for any reason, or are unacceptable based on
policy, the authorization server [MUST]{.bcp14} construct an error
response, as specified in [Section
5.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749#section-5.2){.relref} of
\[[RFC6749](#RFC6749){.xref}\]. The value of the `error` parameter
[MUST]{.bcp14} be the `invalid_request` error
code.[¶](#section-2.2.2-1){.pilcrow}

If the authorization server is unwilling or unable to issue a token for
any target service indicated by the `resource` or `audience` parameters,
the `invalid_target` error code [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be used in the error
response.[¶](#section-2.2.2-2){.pilcrow}

The authorization server [MAY]{.bcp14} include additional information
regarding the reasons for the error using the `error_description` as
discussed in [Section
5.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749#section-5.2){.relref} of

The following example demonstrates a hypothetical token exchange in
which an OAuth resource server assumes the role of the client during the
exchange. It trades an access token, which it received in a protected
resource request, for a new token that it will use to call to a backend
service (extra line breaks and indentation in the examples are for
display purposes only).[¶](#section-2.3-1){.pilcrow}

In [Figure 2](#main-tereq){.xref}, the resource server assumes the role

in [Figure 1](#main-prr){.xref} is sent to the authorization server
using a request as specified in [Section 2.1](#Request){.xref}. The
value of the `subject_token` parameter carries the access token, and the
value of the `subject_token_type` parameter indicates that it is an
OAuth 2.0 access token. The resource server, acting in the role of the
client, uses its identifier and secret to authenticate to the
authorization server using the HTTP Basic authentication scheme. The
`resource` parameter indicates the location of the backend service,

of the response shown in [Figure 3](#main-teresp){.xref} contains the
new token, which is itself a bearer OAuth access token that is valid for

## [3.](#section-3){.section-number .selfRef} [Token Type Identifiers](#name-token-type-identifiers){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-token-type-identifiers}

Several parameters in this specification utilize an identifier as the
value to describe the token in question. Specifically, they are the
`requested_token_type`, `subject_token_type`, and `actor_token_type`
parameters of the request and the `issued_token_type` member of the
response. Token type identifiers are URIs. Token exchange can work with
both tokens issued by other parties and tokens from the given
authorization server. For the former, the token type identifier
indicates the syntax (e.g., JWT or SAML 2.0) so the authorization server
can parse it; for the latter, it indicates what the given authorization
server issued it for (e.g., `access_token` or
`refresh_token`).[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

The following token type identifiers are defined by this specification.
Other URIs [MAY]{.bcp14} be used to indicate other token
types.[¶](#section-3-2){.pilcrow}

urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token
:   Indicates that the token is an OAuth 2.0 access token issued by the
    given authorization server.[¶](#section-3-3.2){.pilcrow}

urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:refresh_token
:   Indicates that the token is an OAuth 2.0 refresh token issued by the
    given authorization server.[¶](#section-3-3.4){.pilcrow}

urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:id_token
:   Indicates that the token is an ID Token as defined in Section 2 of
    \[[OpenID.Core](#OpenID.Core){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3-3.6){.pilcrow}

urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:saml1

    assertion.[¶](#section-3-3.8){.pilcrow}

    assertion.[¶](#section-3-3.10){.pilcrow}

The value `urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:jwt`, which is defined in
[Section 9](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519#section-9){.relref}
of \[[JWT](#RFC7519){.xref}\], indicates that the token is a
JWT.[¶](#section-3-4){.pilcrow}

The distinction between an access token and a JWT is subtle. An access
token represents a delegated authorization decision, whereas JWT is a
token format. An access token can be formatted as a JWT but doesn\'t
necessarily have to be. And a JWT might well be an access token, but not
all JWTs are access tokens. The intent of this specification is that
`urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token` be an indicator that the
token is a typical OAuth access token issued by the authorization server
in question, opaque to the client, and usable the same manner as any
other access token obtained from that authorization server. (It could

fact.) Whereas, `urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:jwt` is to indicate
specifically that a JWT is being requested or sent (perhaps in a

obtain an access token from a different authorization server as is
facilitated by

It is useful to have defined mechanisms to express delegation within a
token as well as to express authorization to delegate or impersonate.
Although the token exchange protocol described herein can be used with
any type of token, this section defines claims to express such semantics
specifically for JWTs and in an OAuth 2.0 Token Introspection
\[[RFC7662](#RFC7662){.xref}\] response. Similar definitions for other
types of tokens are possible but beyond the scope of this
specification.[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

Note that the claims not established herein but used in examples and
descriptions, such as `iss`, `sub`, `exp`, etc., are defined by
\[[JWT](#RFC7519){.xref}\].[¶](#section-4-2){.pilcrow}

### [4.1.](#section-4.1){.section-number .selfRef} [\"act\" (Actor) Claim](#name-act-actor-claim){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-act-actor-claim}

The `act` (actor) claim provides a means within a JWT to express that
delegation has occurred and identify the acting party to whom authority
has been delegated. The `act` claim value is a JSON object, and members
in the JSON object are claims that identify the actor. The claims that
make up the `act` claim identify and possibly provide additional
information about the actor. For example, the combination of the two
claims `iss` and `sub` might be necessary to uniquely identify an
actor.[¶](#section-4.1-1){.pilcrow}

However, claims within the `act` claim pertain only to the identity of
the actor and are not relevant to the validity of the containing JWT in
the same manner as the top-level claims. Consequently, non-identity
claims (e.g., `exp`, `nbf`, and `aud`) are not meaningful when used
within an `act` claim and are therefore not
used.[¶](#section-4.1-2){.pilcrow}

[Figure 5](#act-ex){.xref} illustrates the `act` (actor) claim within a
JWT Claims Set. The claims of the token itself are about
user\@example.com while the `act` claim indicates that
admin\@example.com is the current actor.[¶](#section-4.1-3){.pilcrow}

[Figure 5](#figure-5){.selfRef}: [Actor
Claim](#name-actor-claim){.selfRef}
:::

A chain of delegation can be expressed by nesting one `act` claim within
another. The outermost `act` claim represents the current actor while
nested `act` claims represent prior actors. The least recent actor is
the most deeply nested. The nested `act` claims serve as a history trail
that connects the initial request and subject through the various
delegation steps undertaken before reaching the current actor. In this
sense, the current actor is considered to include the entire
authorization/delegation history, leading naturally to the nested
structure described here.[¶](#section-4.1-5){.pilcrow}

For the purpose of applying access control policy, the consumer of a
token [MUST]{.bcp14} only consider the token\'s top-level claims and the
party identified as the current actor by the `act` claim. Prior actors
identified by any nested `act` claims are informational only and are not
to be considered in access control
decisions.[¶](#section-4.1-6){.pilcrow}

The following example in [Figure 6](#acts-ex){.xref} illustrates nested
`act` (actor) claims within a JWT Claims Set. The claims of the token
itself are about user\@example.com while the `act` claim indicates that
the system \<https://service16.example.com> is the current actor and
\<https://service77.example.com> was a prior actor. Such a token might
come about as the result of service16 receiving a token in a call from
service77 and exchanging it for a token suitable to call service26 while
the authorization server notes the situation in the newly issued
token.[¶](#section-4.1-7){.pilcrow}

The `may_act` claim makes a statement that one party is authorized to
become the actor and act on behalf of another party. The claim might be
used, for example, when a `subject_token` is presented to the token
endpoint in a token exchange request and `may_act` claim in the subject
token can be used by the authorization server to determine whether the
client (or party identified in the `actor_token`) is authorized to
engage in the requested delegation or impersonation. The claim value is
a JSON object, and members in the JSON object are claims that identify
the party that is asserted as being eligible to act for the party
identified by the JWT containing the claim. The claims that make up the
`may_act` claim identify and possibly provide additional information
about the authorized actor. For example, the combination of the two
claims `iss` and `sub` are sometimes necessary to uniquely identify an
authorized actor, while the `email` claim might be used to provide
additional useful information about that
party.[¶](#section-4.4-1){.pilcrow}

However, claims within the `may_act` claim pertain only to the identity
of that party and are not relevant to the validity of the containing JWT
in the same manner as top-level claims. Consequently, claims such as
`exp`, `nbf`, and `aud` are not meaningful when used within a `may_act`
claim and are therefore not used.[¶](#section-4.4-2){.pilcrow}

[Figure 9](#may_act-ex){.xref} illustrates the `may_act` claim within a

user\@example.com while the `may_act` claim indicates that

Much of the guidance from [Section

\[[RFC6749](#RFC6749){.xref}\], the Security Considerations in The OAuth
2.0 Authorization Framework, is also applicable here. Furthermore,
\[[RFC6819](#RFC6819){.xref}\] provides additional security
considerations for OAuth, and
\[[OAUTH-SECURITY](#I-D.ietf-oauth-security-topics){.xref}\] has updated
security guidance based on deployment experience and new threats that
have emerged since OAuth 2.0 was originally
published.[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

All of the normal security issues that are discussed in
\[[JWT](#RFC7519){.xref}\], especially in relationship to comparing URIs
and dealing with unrecognized values, also apply
here.[¶](#section-5-2){.pilcrow}

In addition, both delegation and impersonation introduce unique security
issues. Any time one principal is delegated the rights of another
principal, the potential for abuse is a concern. The use of the `scope`
claim (in addition to other typical constraints such as a limited token
lifetime) is suggested to mitigate potential for such abuse, as it
restricts the contexts in which the delegated rights can be
exercised.[¶](#section-5-3){.pilcrow}

The `actor_token` in the prior request is a JWT, and the decoded JWT
Claims Set is shown here. This JWT is also intended for consumption by
the authorization server before a specific expiration time. The subject
of the JWT (`admin@example.net`) is the actor that will wield the
security token being requested.[¶](#section-a.2.3-1){.pilcrow}

The `access_token` parameter of the token exchange response shown below
contains the new token that the client requested. The other parameters
of the response indicate that the token is a JWT that expires in an hour
and that the access token type is not applicable since the issued token
is not an access token.[¶](#section-a.2.4-1){.pilcrow}

The decoded JWT Claims Set of the issued token is shown below. The new
JWT is issued by the authorization server and intended for consumption
by a system entity known by the logical name
`urn:example:cooperation-context` any time before its expiration. The
subject (`sub`) of the JWT is the same as the subject of the
`subject_token` used to make the request. The actor (`act`) of the JWT
is the same as the subject of the `actor_token` used to make the
request. This indicates delegation and identifies `admin@example.net` as
the current actor to whom authority has been delegated to act on behalf
of `user@example.net`.[¶](#section-a.2.5-1){.pilcrow}
