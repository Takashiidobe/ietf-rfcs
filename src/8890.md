# RFC 8890 {#rfcnum}

# The Internet is for End Users {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

This document explains why the IAB believes that, when there is a
conflict between the interests of end users of the Internet and other
parties, IETF decisions should favor end users. It also explores how the
IETF can more effectively achieve
this.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

Many who participate in the IETF are most comfortable making what we
believe to be purely technical decisions; our process favors technical
merit through our well-known mantra of \"rough consensus and running
code.\"[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

Nevertheless, the running code that results from our process (when
things work well) inevitably has an impact beyond technical
considerations, because the underlying decisions afford some uses while
discouraging others. While we believe we are making only technical
decisions, in reality, we are defining (in some degree) what is possible
on the Internet itself.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

This impact has become significant. As the Internet increasingly
mediates essential functions in societies, it has unavoidably become
profoundly political; it has helped people overthrow governments,
revolutionize social orders, swing elections, control populations,
collect data about individuals, and reveal secrets. It has created
wealth for some individuals and companies while destroying that of
others.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

All of this raises the question: For whom do we go through the pain of
gathering rough consensus and writing running
code?[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

After all, there are a variety of parties that standards can benefit,
such as (but not limited to) end users, network operators, schools,
equipment vendors, specification authors, specification implementers,
content owners, governments, nongovernmental organizations, social
movements, employers, and parents.[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}

Successful specifications will provide some benefit to all the relevant
parties because standards do not represent a zero-sum game. However,
there are sometimes situations where there is a conflict between the
needs of two (or more) parties.[¶](#section-1-6){.pilcrow}

In these situations, when one of those parties is an \"end user\" of the
Internet \-- for example, a person using a web browser, mail client, or
another agent that connects to the Internet \-- the Internet
Architecture Board argues that the IETF should favor their interests
over those of other parties.[¶](#section-1-7){.pilcrow}

[Section 2](#who){.xref} explains what is meant by \"end users\",
[Section 3](#why){.xref} outlines why IETF work should prioritize them,
and [Section 4](#how){.xref} describes how we can do
that.[¶](#section-1-8){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-2 .section}
## [2.](#section-2){.section-number .selfRef} [Who Are \"End Users\"?](#name-who-are-end-users){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-who-are-end-users}

In this document, \"end users\" means human users whose activities IETF
standards support, sometimes indirectly. Thus, the end user of a
protocol to manage routers is not a router administrator; it is the
people using the network that the router operates
within.[¶](#section-2-1){.pilcrow}

End users are not necessarily a homogenous group; they might have
different views of how the Internet should work and might occupy several
roles, such as a seller, buyer, publisher, reader, service provider, and
consumer. An end user might browse the Web, monitor remote equipment,
play a game, videoconference with colleagues, send messages to friends,
or perform an operation in a remote surgery theater. They might be \"at
the keyboard\" or represented by software indirectly (e.g., as a
daemon).[¶](#section-2-2){.pilcrow}

Likewise, an individual end user might have many interests (e.g.,
privacy, security, flexibility, reachability) that are sometimes in
tension.[¶](#section-2-3){.pilcrow}

A person whose interests we need to consider might not directly be using
a specific system connected to the Internet. For example, if a child is
using a browser, the interests of that child\'s parents or guardians may
be relevant. A person pictured in a photograph may have an interest in
systems that process that photograph; a person entering a room with
sensors that send data to the Internet may have interests that may be
involved in our deliberations about how those sensor readings are
handled.[¶](#section-2-4){.pilcrow}

While such less-direct interactions between people and the Internet may
be harder to evaluate, this document\'s concept of \"end user\"
nonetheless includes such people.[¶](#section-2-5){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-3 .section}
## [3.](#section-3){.section-number .selfRef} [Why the IETF Should Prioritize End Users](#name-why-the-ietf-should-priorit){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-why-the-ietf-should-priorit}

Even before the IETF was established, the Internet technical community
has focused on user needs since at least \[[RFC0001](#RFC0001){.xref}\],
which stated that \"One of our goals must be to stimulate the immediate
and easy use by a wide class of users.\"[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

And, while we specialize in technical matters, the IETF is not neutral
about the purpose of its work in developing the Internet; in \"A Mission
Statement for the IETF\" \[[RFC3935](#RFC3935){.xref}\], the definitions
include:[¶](#section-3-2){.pilcrow}

> The IETF community wants the Internet to succeed because we believe
> that the existence of the Internet, and its influence on economics,
> communication, and education, will help us to build a better human
> society.[¶](#section-3-3){.pilcrow}

Later, in \"The Scope of the Internet\" ([Section
4.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3935#section-4.1){.relref} of
\[[RFC3935](#RFC3935){.xref}\]), it says:[¶](#section-3-4){.pilcrow}

> The Internet isn\'t value-neutral, and neither is the IETF. We want
> the Internet to be useful for communities that share our commitment to
> openness and fairness. We embrace technical concepts such as
> decentralized control, edge-user empowerment and sharing of resources,
> because those concepts resonate with the core values of the IETF
> community. These concepts have little to do with the technology
> that\'s possible, and much to do with the technology that we choose to
> create.[¶](#section-3-5){.pilcrow}

In other words, the IETF develops and maintains the Internet to promote
the social good. The society that the IETF is attempting to enhance is
composed of end users, along with groups of them forming businesses,
governments, clubs, civil society organizations, and other
institutions.[¶](#section-3-6){.pilcrow}

Merely advancing the measurable success of the Internet (e.g.,
deployment size, bandwidth, latency, number of users) is not an adequate
goal; doing so ignores how technology is so often used as a lever to
assert power over users, rather than empower
them.[¶](#section-3-7){.pilcrow}

Beyond fulfilling the IETF\'s mission, prioritizing end users can also
help to ensure the long-term health of the Internet and the IETF\'s
relevance to it. Perceptions of capture by vendors or other providers
harm both; the IETF\'s work will (deservedly) lose end users\' trust if
it prioritizes (or is perceived to prioritize) others\' interests over
them.[¶](#section-3-8){.pilcrow}

Ultimately, the Internet will succeed or fail based upon the actions of
its end users, because they are the driving force behind its growth to
date. Not prioritizing them jeopardizes the network effect that the
Internet relies upon to provide so much
value.[¶](#section-3-9){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-4 .section}
## [4.](#section-4){.section-number .selfRef} [How the IETF Can Prioritize End Users](#name-how-the-ietf-can-prioritize){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-how-the-ietf-can-prioritize}

There are a few ways that the IAB believes the IETF community can
prioritize end users, based upon our observations. This is not a
complete list.[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

::: {#engaging-the-internet-community}
::: {#section-4.1 .section}
### [4.1.](#section-4.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Engaging the Internet Community](#name-engaging-the-internet-commu){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-engaging-the-internet-commu}

The IETF community does not have any unique insight into what is \"good
for end users\", and it is not uncommon for us to be at a further
disadvantage because of our close understanding of some \-- but not all
\-- aspects of the Internet.[¶](#section-4.1-1){.pilcrow}

At the same time, we have a culture of considerable deference to a
broader \"Internet community\" \-- roughly what this document calls end
users \-- in our decision-making processes. Mere deference, however, is
not adequate; even with the best intentions, we cannot assume that our
experiences of the Internet are those of all of its end users or that
our decisions have a positive impact upon
them.[¶](#section-4.1-2){.pilcrow}

Therefore, we have not only a responsibility to analyze and consider the
impacts of the IETF\'s work, but also a responsibility to consult with
that greater Internet community. In particular, we should do so when one
of our decisions has a potential impact upon end
users.[¶](#section-4.1-3){.pilcrow}

The IETF community faces significant hurdles in doing so. Our work is
specialized and often esoteric, and processes for developing standards
often involve very long timescales. Affected parties are rarely
technical experts, and they often base their understanding of the
Internet upon incomplete (and sometimes inaccurate) models. Often, even
when we try to engage a broader audience, their participation is minimal
\-- until a change affects someone in a way they don\'t like. Surprising
the Internet community is rarely a good
outcome.[¶](#section-4.1-4){.pilcrow}

Government-sponsored individuals sometimes participate in the IETF
community. While this is welcome, it should not be taken as
automatically representative of end users elsewhere, or even all end
users in the relevant jurisdiction. Furthermore, what is desirable in
one jurisdiction (or at least to its administrators) might be
detrimental in others (see [Section
4.4](#conflict){.xref}).[¶](#section-4.1-5){.pilcrow}

While some civil society organizations specialize in technology and
Internet policy, they rarely can participate broadly, nor are they
necessarily representative of the larger Internet community.
Nevertheless, their understanding of end-user needs is often profound,
and they are in many ways the best-informed advocates for end-user
concerns; they should be considered a primary channel for engaging the
broader Internet community.[¶](#section-4.1-6){.pilcrow}

A promising approach to help fill these gaps is to identify and engage
with specifically affected communities when making decisions that might
affect them, for example, one or more industry associations, user
groups, or a set of individuals, though we can\'t formally ensure that
they are appropriately representative.[¶](#section-4.1-7){.pilcrow}

In doing so, we should not require them to \"come to us\"; unless a
stakeholder community is already engaged in the IETF process
effectively, the IETF community should explore how to meet with them on
their terms \-- take the initiative to contact them, explain our work,
and solicit their feedback.[¶](#section-4.1-8){.pilcrow}

In particular, while IAB workshops, BOFs, and Bar BOFs can be an
effective mechanism to gather input within our community, they rarely
have the visibility into other communities that is required to solicit
input, much less effective participation.[¶](#section-4.1-9){.pilcrow}

Instead, an event like a workshop may be more effective if co-located
with \-- and ideally hosted or co-hosted by \-- a forum that\'s familiar
to that stakeholder community. We should also raise the visibility of
IETF work (or potential IETF work) in such fora through conference
talks, panels, newsletter articles, etc.[¶](#section-4.1-10){.pilcrow}

For example, the IAB ESCAPE workshop \[[RFC8752](#RFC8752){.xref}\]
solicited input from Internet publishers and advertisers about a
proposal that might affect them. While the workshop was considered
successful, participation might have been improved by identifying an
appropriate industry forum and working with them to host the
event.[¶](#section-4.1-11){.pilcrow}

When we engage with the Internet community, we should also clearly
identify tailored feedback mechanisms (e.g., subscribing to a mailing
list may not be appropriate) and assure that they are well known in
those communities.[¶](#section-4.1-12){.pilcrow}

The Internet Society can be an invaluable partner in these efforts;
their focus on the Internet community, policy expertise, and resources
can help to facilitate discussions with the appropriate
parties.[¶](#section-4.1-13){.pilcrow}

Finally, we should remember that the RFC Series contains Requests For
Comments; if there are serious implications of our work, we should
document them and ask for feedback from the Internet
community.[¶](#section-4.1-14){.pilcrow}

### [4.2.](#section-4.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Creating User-Focused Systems](#name-creating-user-focused-syste){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-creating-user-focused-syste}

We should pay particular attention to the kinds of architectures we
create and whether they encourage or discourage an Internet that works
for end users.[¶](#section-4.2-1){.pilcrow}

For example, one of the most successful Internet applications is the
Web, which uses the HTTP application protocol. One of HTTP\'s key
implementation roles is that of the web browser \-- called the \"user
agent\" in \[[RFC7230](#RFC7230){.xref}\] and other
specifications.[¶](#section-4.2-2){.pilcrow}

User agents act as intermediaries between a service and the end user;
rather than downloading an executable program from a service that has
arbitrary access into the users\' system, the user agent only allows
limited access to display content and run code in a sandboxed
environment. End users are diverse and the ability of a few user agents
to represent individual interests properly is imperfect, but this
arrangement is an improvement over the alternative \-- the need to trust
a website completely with all information on your system to browse
it.[¶](#section-4.2-3){.pilcrow}

Defining the user agent role in standards also creates a virtuous cycle;
it allows multiple implementations, allowing end users to switch between
them with relatively low costs (although there are concerns about the
complexity of the Web creating barriers to entry for new
implementations). This creates an incentive for implementers to consider
the users\' needs carefully, which are often reflected into the defining
standards. The resulting ecosystem has many remaining problems, but a
distinguished user agent role provides an opportunity to improve
it.[¶](#section-4.2-4){.pilcrow}

In contrast, the Internet of Things (IoT) has not yet seen the broad
adoption of a similar role; many current systems require opaque,
vendor-specific software or hardware for the user-facing component.
Perhaps as a result of this, that ecosystem and its end users face
serious challenges.[¶](#section-4.2-5){.pilcrow}

### [4.3.](#section-4.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Identifying Negative End-User Impact](#name-identifying-negative-end-us){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-identifying-negative-end-us}

At its best, our work will unambiguously build a better human society.
Sometimes, we will consciously be neutral and open-ended, allowing the
\"tussle\" among stakeholders to produce a range of results (see
\[[TUSSLE](#TUSSLE){.xref}\] for further
discussion).[¶](#section-4.3-1){.pilcrow}

At the very least, however, we must examine our work for negative impact
on end users and take steps to mitigate it where encountered. In
particular, when we\'ve identified a conflict between the interests of
end users and other stakeholders, we should err on the side of
protecting end users.[¶](#section-4.3-2){.pilcrow}

Note that \"negative impact on end users\" is not defined in this
document; that is something that the relevant body (e.g., working group)
needs to discuss and come to consensus on. Merely asserting that
something is harmful is not adequate. The converse is also true, though;
it\'s not good practice to avoid identifying harms, nor is it acceptable
to ignore them when brought to our
attention.[¶](#section-4.3-3){.pilcrow}

The IAB and IETF have already established a body of guidance for
situations where this conflict is common, including (but not limited to)
\[[RFC7754](#RFC7754){.xref}\] on filtering,
\[[RFC7258](#RFC7258){.xref}\] and \[[RFC7624](#RFC7624){.xref}\] on
pervasive surveillance, \[[RFC7288](#RFC7288){.xref}\] on host
firewalls, and \[[RFC6973](#RFC6973){.xref}\] regarding privacy
considerations.[¶](#section-4.3-4){.pilcrow}

Much of that advice has focused on maintaining the end-to-end properties
of a connection \[[RFC3724](#RFC3724){.xref}\]. This does not mean that
our responsibility to end users stops there; decisions might affect them
in other ways. For example, data collection by various applications even
inside otherwise secure connections is a major problem on the Internet
today. Also, inappropriate concentration of power on the Internet has
become a concerning phenomenon \-- one that protocol design might have
some influence upon.[¶](#section-4.3-5){.pilcrow}

### [4.4.](#section-4.4){.section-number .selfRef} [Handling Conflicting End-User Needs](#name-handling-conflicting-end-us){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-handling-conflicting-end-us}

When the needs of different end users conflict (for example, two sets of
end users both have reasonable desires), we again should try to minimize
negative impact.[¶](#section-4.4-1){.pilcrow}

For example, when a decision improves the Internet for end users in one
jurisdiction, but at the cost of potential harm to others elsewhere,
that is not a good trade-off. As such, we design the Internet for the
pessimal environment; if a user can be harmed, they probably will be,
somewhere.[¶](#section-4.4-2){.pilcrow}

There may be cases where genuine technical need requires compromise.
However, such trade-offs are carefully examined and avoided when there
are alternate means of achieving the desired goals. If they cannot be,
these choices and reasoning ought to be thoroughly
documented.[¶](#section-4.4-3){.pilcrow}
