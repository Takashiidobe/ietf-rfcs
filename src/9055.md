# RFC 9055 {#rfcnum}

# Deterministic Networking (DetNet) Security Considerations {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

A DetNet (deterministic network) provides specific performance
guarantees to its data flows, such as extremely low data loss rates and
bounded latency (including bounded latency variation, i.e., \"jitter\").
As a result, securing a DetNet requires that in addition to the best
practice security measures taken for any mission-critical network,
additional security measures may be needed to secure the intended
operation of these novel service
properties.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

This document addresses DetNet-specific security considerations from the
perspectives of both the DetNet system-level designer and component
designer. System considerations include a taxonomy of relevant threats
and attacks, and associations of threats versus use cases and service
properties. Component-level considerations include ingress filtering and
packet arrival-time violation
detection.[¶](#section-abstract-2){.pilcrow}

This document also addresses security considerations specific to the IP
and MPLS data plane technologies, thereby complementing the Security
Considerations sections of those
documents.[¶](#section-abstract-3){.pilcrow}

A deterministic IP network (\"[Deterministic Networking
Architecture](#RFC8655){.xref}\" \[[RFC8655](#RFC8655){.xref}\]) can
carry data flows for real-time applications with extremely low data loss
rates and bounded latency. The bounds on latency defined by DetNet (as
described in \[[RFC9016](#RFC9016){.xref}\]) include both worst-case
latency (Maximum Latency, [Section
5.9.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9016#section-5.9.2){.relref} of
\[[RFC9016](#RFC9016){.xref}\]) and worst-case jitter (Maximum Latency
Variation, [Section
5.9.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9016#section-5.9.3){.relref} of
\[[RFC9016](#RFC9016){.xref}\]). Data flows with deterministic
properties are well established for Ethernet networks (see
Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN),
\[[IEEE802.1BA](#IEEE802.1BA){.xref}\]); DetNet brings these
capabilities to the IP network.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

Deterministic IP networks have been successfully deployed in real-time
Operational Technology (OT) applications for some years; however, such
networks are typically isolated from external access, and thus the
security threat from external attackers is low. An example of such an
isolated network is a network deployed within an aircraft, which is
\"air gapped\" from the outside world. DetNet specifies a set of
technologies that enable creation of deterministic flows on IP-based
networks of a potentially wide area (on the scale of a corporate
network), potentially merging OT traffic with best-effort Information
Technology (IT) traffic, and placing OT network components into contact
with IT network components, thereby exposing the OT traffic and
components to security threats that were not present in an isolated OT
network.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

These DetNet (OT-type) technologies may not have previously been
deployed on a wide area IP-based network that also carries IT traffic,
and thus they can present security considerations that may be new to
IP-based wide area network designers; this document provides insight
into such system-level security considerations. In addition, designers
of DetNet components (such as routers) face new security-related
challenges in providing DetNet services, for example, maintaining
reliable isolation between traffic flows in an environment where IT
traffic co-mingles with critical reserved-bandwidth OT traffic; this
document also examines security implications internal to DetNet
components.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

Security is of particularly high importance in DetNet because many of
the use cases that are enabled by DetNet \[[RFC8578](#RFC8578){.xref}\]
include control of physical devices (power grid devices, industrial
controls, building controls, etc.) that can have high operational costs
for failure and present potentially attractive targets for cyber
attackers.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

This situation is even more acute given that one of the goals of DetNet
is to provide a \"converged network\", i.e., one that includes both IT
traffic and OT traffic, thus exposing potentially sensitive OT devices
to attack in ways that were not previously common (usually because they
were under a separate control system or otherwise isolated from the IT
network, for example \[[ARINC664P7](#ARINC664P7){.xref}\]). Security
considerations for OT networks are not a new area, and there are many OT
networks today that are connected to wide area networks or the Internet;
this document focuses on the issues that are specific to the DetNet
technologies and use cases.[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}

Given the above considerations, securing a DetNet starts with a
scrupulously well-designed and well-managed engineered network following
industry best practices for security at both the data plane and
controller plane, as well as for any Operations, Administration, and
Maintenance (OAM) implementation; this is the assumed starting point for
the considerations discussed herein. Such assumptions also depend on the
network components themselves upholding the security-related properties
that are to be assumed by DetNet system-level designers; for example,
the assumption that network traffic associated with a given flow can
never affect traffic associated with a different flow is only true if
the underlying components make it so. Such properties, which may
represent new challenges to component designers, are also considered
herein.[¶](#section-1-6){.pilcrow}

Starting with a \"well-managed network\", as noted above, enables us to
exclude some of the more powerful adversary capabilities from the
Internet Threat Model of \[[BCP72](#BCP72){.xref}\], such as the ability
to arbitrarily drop or delay any or all traffic. Given this reduced
attacker capability, we can present security considerations based on
attacker capabilities that are more directly relevant to a
DetNet.[¶](#section-1-7){.pilcrow}

In this context, we view the \"conventional\" (i.e., non-time-sensitive)
network design and management aspects of network security as being
primarily concerned with preventing denial of service, i.e., they must
ensure that DetNet traffic goes where it\'s supposed to and that an
external attacker can\'t inject traffic that disrupts the delivery
timing assurance of the DetNet. The time-specific aspects of DetNet
security presented here take up where those \"conventional\" design and
management aspects leave off.[¶](#section-1-8){.pilcrow}

However, note that \"conventional\" methods for mitigating (among all
the others) denial-of-service attacks (such as throttling) can only be
effectively used in a DetNet when their use does not compromise the
required time-sensitive or behavioral properties required for the OT
flows on the network. For example, a \"retry\" protocol is typically not
going to be compatible with a low-latency (worst-case maximum latency)
requirement; however, if in a specific use case and implementation such
a retry protocol is able to meet the timing constraints, then it may
well be used in that context. Similarly, if common security protocols
such as TLS/DTLS or IPsec are to be used, it must be verified that their
implementations are able to meet the timing and behavioral requirements
of the time-sensitive network as implemented for the given use case. An
example of \"behavioral properties\" might be that dropping of more than
a specific number of packets in a row is not acceptable according to the
service level agreement.[¶](#section-1-9){.pilcrow}

The exact security requirements for any given DetNet are necessarily
specific to the use cases handled by that network. Thus, the reader is
assumed to be familiar with the specific security requirements of their
use cases, for example, those outlined in the DetNet Use Cases
\[[RFC8578](#RFC8578){.xref}\] and the Security Considerations sections
of the DetNet documents applicable to the network technologies in use,
for example, \[[RFC8939](#RFC8939){.xref}\] for an IP data plane and
\[[RFC8964](#RFC8964){.xref}\] for an MPLS data plane. Readers can find
a general introduction to the DetNet Architecture in
\[[RFC8655](#RFC8655){.xref}\], the DetNet Data Plane in
\[[RFC8938](#RFC8938){.xref}\], and the Flow Information Model in
\[[RFC9016](#RFC9016){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-10){.pilcrow}

The DetNet technologies include ways to:[¶](#section-1-11){.pilcrow}

-   [Assign data plane resources for DetNet flows in some or all of the
    intermediate nodes (routers) along the path of the
    flow[¶](#section-1-12.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-12.1}

-   [Distribute data from DetNet flow packets over time and/or space to
    ensure delivery of the data in each packet in spite of the loss of a

This document includes sections considering DetNet component design as
well as system design. The latter includes a taxonomy and analysis of
threats, threat impacts and mitigations, and an association of attacks
with use cases (based on [Section
11](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8578#section-11){.relref} of
\[[RFC8578](#RFC8578){.xref}\]).[¶](#section-1-13){.pilcrow}

This document is based on the premise that there will be a very broad
range of DetNet applications and use cases, ranging in size and scope
from individual industrial machines to networks that span an entire
country \[[RFC8578](#RFC8578){.xref}\]. Thus, no single set of
prescriptions (such as exactly which mitigation should be applied to
which segment of a DetNet) can be applicable to all of them, and indeed
any single one that we might prescribe would inevitably prove
impractical for some use case, perhaps one that does not even exist at
the time of this writing. Thus, we are not prescriptive here; we are
stating the desired end result, with the understanding that most DetNet
use cases will necessarily differ from each other, and there is no \"one
size fits all\".[¶](#section-1-14){.pilcrow}

This section provides guidance for implementers of components to be used
in a DetNet.[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

As noted above, DetNet provides resource allocation, explicit routes,
and redundant path support. Each of these has associated security
implications, which are discussed in this section, in the context of
component design. Detection, reporting and appropriate action in the
case of packet arrival-time violations are also

#### [3.1.1.](#section-3.1.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Inviolable Flows](#name-inviolable-flows){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-inviolable-flows}

A DetNet system security designer relies on the premise that any
resources allocated to a resource-reserved (OT-type) flow are
inviolable; in other words, there is no physical possibility within a
DetNet component that resources allocated to a given DetNet flow can be
compromised by any type of traffic in the network. This includes
malicious traffic as well as inadvertent traffic such as might be
produced by a malfunctioning component, or due to interactions between
components that were not sufficiently tested for interoperability. From
a security standpoint, this is a critical assumption, for example, when
designing against DoS attacks. In other words, with correctly designed
components and security mechanisms, one can prevent malicious activities
from impacting other resources.[¶](#section-3.1.1-1){.pilcrow}

However, achieving the goal of absolutely inviolable flows may not be
technically or economically feasible for any given use case, given the
broad range of possible use cases (e.g., \[[RFC8578](#RFC8578){.xref}\])
and their associated security considerations as outlined in this
document. It can be viewed as a continuum of security requirements, from
isolated ultra-low latency systems that may have little security
vulnerability (such as an industrial machine) to broadly distributed
systems with many possible attack vectors and OT security concerns (such
as a utility network). Given this continuum, the design principle
employed in this document is to specify the desired end results, without
being overly prescriptive in how the results are achieved, reflecting
the understanding that no individual implementation is likely to be
appropriate for every DetNet use case.[¶](#section-3.1.1-2){.pilcrow}

#### [3.1.2.](#section-3.1.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Design Trade-Off Considerations in the Use Cases Continuum](#name-design-trade-off-considerat){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-design-trade-off-considerat}

For any given DetNet use case and its associated security requirements,
it is important for the DetNet system designer to understand the
interaction and design trade-offs that inevitably need to be reconciled
between the desired end results and the DetNet protocols, as well as the
DetNet system and component design.[¶](#section-3.1.2-1){.pilcrow}

For any given component, as designed for any given use case (or scope of
use cases), it is the responsibility of the component designer to ensure
that the premise of inviolable flows is supported to the extent that
they deem necessary to support their target use
cases.[¶](#section-3.1.2-2){.pilcrow}

For example, the component may include traffic shaping and policing at
the ingress to prevent corrupted, malicious, or excessive packets from
entering the network, thereby decreasing the likelihood that any traffic
will interfere with any DetNet OT flow. The component may include
integrity protection for some or all of the header fields such as those
used for flow ID, thereby decreasing the likelihood that a packet whose
flow ID has been compromised might be directed into a different flow
path. The component may verify every single packet header at every
forwarding location, or only at certain points. In any of these cases,
the component may use dynamic performance analytics ([Section
7.7](#DpaMitigation){.xref}) to cause action to be initiated to address
the situation in an appropriate and timely manner, either at the data
plane or controller plane, or both in concert. The component\'s software
and hardware may include measures to ensure the integrity of the
resource allocation/deallocation process. Other design aspects of the
component may help ensure that the adverse effects of malicious traffic
are more limited, for example, by protecting network control interfaces
or minimizing cascade failures. The component may include features
specific to a given use case, such as configuration of the response to a
given sequential packet loss count.[¶](#section-3.1.2-3){.pilcrow}

Ultimately, due to cost and complexity factors, the security properties
of a component designed for low-cost systems may be (by design) far
inferior to a component with similar intended functionality, but
designed for highly secure or otherwise critical applications, perhaps
at substantially higher cost. Any given component is designed for some
set of use cases and accordingly will have certain limitations on its
security properties and vulnerabilities. It is thus the responsibility
of the system designer to assure themselves that the components they use
in their design are capable of satisfying their overall system security
requirements.[¶](#section-3.1.2-4){.pilcrow}

In order for the system designer to adequately understand the
security-related behavior of a given component, the designer of any
component intended for use with DetNet needs to clearly document the
security properties of that component. For example, to address the case
where a corrupted packet in which the flow identification information is
compromised and thus may incidentally match the flow ID of another
(\"victim\") DetNet flow, resulting in additional unauthorized traffic
on the victim, the documentation might state that the component employs
integrity protection on the flow identification
fields.[¶](#section-3.1.3-1){.pilcrow}

#### [3.1.4.](#section-3.1.4){.section-number .selfRef} [Fail-Safe Component Behavior](#name-fail-safe-component-behavio){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-fail-safe-component-behavio}

Even when the security properties of a component are understood and well
specified, if the component malfunctions, for example, due to physical
circumstances unpredicted by the component designer, it may be difficult
or impossible to fully prevent malfunction of the network. The degree to
which a component is hardened against various types of failures is a
distinguishing feature of the component and its design, and the overall
system design can only be as strong as its weakest
link.[¶](#section-3.1.4-1){.pilcrow}

However, all networks are subject to this level of uncertainty; it is
not unique to DetNet. Having said that, DetNet raises the bar by
changing many added latency scenarios from tolerable annoyances to
unacceptable service violations. That in turn underscores the importance
of system integrity, as well as correct and stable configuration of the
network and its nodes, as discussed in [Section
1](#Introduction){.xref}.[¶](#section-3.1.4-2){.pilcrow}

#### [3.1.5.](#section-3.1.5){.section-number .selfRef} [Flow Aggregation Example](#name-flow-aggregation-example){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-flow-aggregation-example}

As another example regarding resource allocation implementation,
consider the implementation of Flow Aggregation for DetNet flows (as
discussed in \[[RFC8938](#RFC8938){.xref}\]). In this example, say there
are N flows that are to be aggregated; thus, the bandwidth resources of
the aggregate flow must be sufficient to contain the sum of the
bandwidth reservation for the N flows. However, if one of those flows
were to consume more than its individually allocated bandwidth, this
could cause starvation of the other flows. Thus, simply providing and
enforcing the calculated aggregate bandwidth may not be a complete
solution; the bandwidth for each individual flow must still be
guaranteed, for example, via ingress policing of each flow (i.e., before
it is aggregated). Alternatively, if by some other means each flow to be
aggregated can be trusted not to exceed its allocated bandwidth, the
same goal can be achieved.[¶](#section-3.1.5-1){.pilcrow}

:::

::: {#section-3.2 .section}
### [3.2.](#section-3.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Explicit Routes](#name-explicit-routes){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-explicit-routes}

The DetNet-specific purpose for constraining the ability of the DetNet
to reroute OT traffic is to maintain the specified service parameters
(such as upper and lower latency boundaries) for a given flow. For
example, if the network were to reroute a flow (or some part of a flow)
based exclusively on statistical path usage metrics, or due to malicious
activity, it is possible that the new path would have a latency that is
outside the required latency bounds that were designed into the original
TE-designed path, thereby violating the quality of service for the
affected flow (or part of that flow).[¶](#section-3.2-1){.pilcrow}

However, it is acceptable for the network to reroute OT traffic in such
a way as to maintain the specified latency bounds (and any other
specified service properties) for any reason, for example, in response
to a runtime component or path failure.[¶](#section-3.2-2){.pilcrow}

So from a DetNet security standpoint, the DetNet system designer can
expect that any component designed for use in a DetNet will deliver the
packets within the agreed-upon service parameters. For the component
designer, this means that in order for a component to achieve that
expectation, any component that is involved in controlling or
implementing any change of the initially TE-configured flow routes must
prevent rerouting of OT flows (whether malicious or accidental) that
might adversely affect delivering the traffic within the specified
service parameters.[¶](#section-3.2-3){.pilcrow}

### [3.3.](#section-3.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Redundant Path Support](#name-redundant-path-support){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-redundant-path-support}

The DetNet provision for redundant paths (i.e., PREOF, or \"Packet
Replication, Elimination, and Ordering Functions\"), as defined in the
DetNet Architecture \[[RFC8655](#RFC8655){.xref}\], provides the
foundation for high reliability of a DetNet by virtually eliminating
packet loss (i.e., to a degree that is implementation dependent) through
hitless redundant packet delivery.[¶](#section-3.3-1){.pilcrow}

Note: At the time of this writing, PREOF is not defined for the IP data
plane.[¶](#section-3.3-2.1){.pilcrow}

It is the responsibility of the system designer to determine the level
of reliability required by their use case and to specify redundant paths
sufficient to provide the desired level of reliability (in as much as
that reliability can be provided through the use of redundant paths). It
is the responsibility of the component designer to ensure that the
relevant PREOF operations are executed reliably and securely to avoid
potentially catastrophic situations for the operational technology
relying on them.[¶](#section-3.3-3){.pilcrow}

However, note that not all PREOF operations are necessarily implemented
in every network; for example, a packet reordering function may not be
necessary if the packets are either not required to be in order or if
the ordering is performed in some other part of the
network.[¶](#section-3.3-4){.pilcrow}

Ideally, a redundant path for a flow could be specified from end to end;
however, given that this is not always possible (as described in
\[[RFC8655](#RFC8655){.xref}\]), the system designer will need to
consider the resulting end-to-end reliability and security resulting
from any given arrangement of network segments along the path, each of
which provides its individual PREOF implementation and thus its
individual level of reliability and
security.[¶](#section-3.3-5){.pilcrow}

At the data plane, the implementation of PREOF depends on the correct
assignment and interpretation of packet sequence numbers, as well as the
actions taken based on them, such as elimination (including elimination
of packets with spurious sequence numbers). Thus, the integrity of these
values must be maintained by the component as they are assigned by the
DetNet Data Plane Service sub-layer and transported by the Forwarding
sub-layer. This is no different than the integrity of the values in any
header used by the DetNet (or any other) data plane and is not unique to
redundant paths. The integrity protection of header values is technology
dependent; for example, in Layer 2 networks, the integrity of the header
fields can be protected by using MACsec
\[[IEEE802.1AE-2018](#IEEE802.1AE-2018){.xref}\]. Similarly, from the
sequence number injection perspective, it is no different from any other
protocols that use sequence numbers; for particulars of integrity
protection via IPsec Authentication Headers, useful insights are
provided by [Section
3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4302#section-3){.relref} of

### [3.4.](#section-3.4){.section-number .selfRef} [Timing (or Other) Violation Reporting](#name-timing-or-other-violation-r){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-timing-or-other-violation-r}

A task of the DetNet system designer is to create a network such that
for any incoming packet that arrives with any timing or bandwidth
violation, an appropriate action can be taken in order to prevent damage
to the system. The reporting step may be accomplished through dynamic
performance analysis (see [Section 7.7](#DpaMitigation){.xref}) or by
any other means as implemented in one or more components. The action to
be taken for any given circumstance within any given application will
depend on the use case. The action may involve intervention from the
controller plane, or it may be taken \"immediately\" by an individual
component, for example, if a very fast response is
required.[¶](#section-3.4-1){.pilcrow}

The definitions and selections of the actions that can be taken are
properties of the components. The component designer implements these
options according to their expected use cases, which may vary widely
from component to component. Clearly, selecting an inappropriate
response to a given condition may cause more problems than it is
intending to mitigate; for example, a naive approach might be to have
the component shut down the link if a packet arrives outside of its
prescribed time window. However, such a simplistic action may serve the
attacker better than it serves the network. Similarly, simple logging of
such issues may not be adequate since a delay in response could result
in material damage, for example, to mechanical devices controlled by the
network. Thus, a breadth of possible and effective security-related
actions and their configuration is a positive attribute for a DetNet
component.[¶](#section-3.4-2){.pilcrow}

Some possible violations that warrant detection include cases where a
packet arrives:[¶](#section-3.4-3){.pilcrow}

-   [Outside of its prescribed time
    window[¶](#section-3.4-4.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.4-4.1}
-   [Within its time window but with a compromised timestamp that makes
    it appear that it is not within its
    window[¶](#section-3.4-4.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.4-4.2}
-   [Exceeding the reserved flow
    bandwidth[¶](#section-3.4-4.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.4-4.3}

Some possible direct actions that may be taken at the data plane include
traffic policing and shaping functions (e.g., those described in
\[[RFC2475](#RFC2475){.xref}\]), separating flows into per-flow
rate-limited queues, and potentially applying active queue management
\[[RFC7567](#RFC7567){.xref}\]. However, if those (or any other) actions
are to be taken, the system designer must ensure that the results of
such actions do not compromise the continued safe operation of the
system. For example, the network (i.e., the controller plane and data
plane working together) must mitigate in a timely fashion any potential
adverse effect on mechanical devices controlled by the
network.[¶](#section-3.4-5){.pilcrow}

## [4.](#section-4){.section-number .selfRef} [DetNet Security Considerations Compared with Diffserv Security Considerations](#name-detnet-security-considerati){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-detnet-security-considerati}

DetNet is designed to be compatible with Diffserv
\[[RFC2474](#RFC2474){.xref}\] as applied to IT traffic in the DetNet.
DetNet also incorporates the use of the 6-bit value of the
Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) field of the Type of Service
(IPv4) and Traffic Class (IPv6) bytes for flow identification. However,
the DetNet interpretation of the DSCP value for OT traffic is not
equivalent to the per-hop behavior (PHB) selection behavior as defined
by Diffserv.[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

Thus, security considerations for DetNet have some aspects in common
with Diffserv, in fact overlapping 100% with respect to IP IT traffic.
Security considerations for these aspects are part of the existing
literature on IP network security, specifically the Security
Considerations sections of \[[RFC2474](#RFC2474){.xref}\] and
\[[RFC2475](#RFC2475){.xref}\]. However, DetNet also introduces timing
and other considerations that are not present in Diffserv, so the
Diffserv security considerations are a subset of the DetNet security
considerations.[¶](#section-4-2){.pilcrow}

In the case of DetNet OT traffic, the DSCP value is interpreted
differently than in Diffserv and contributes to determination of the
service provided to the packet. In DetNet, there are similar
consequences to Diffserv for lack of detection of, or incorrect handling
of, packets with mismarked DSCP values, and many of the points made in
the Diffserv Security discussions ([Section
6.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2475#section-6.1){.relref} of
\[[RFC2475](#RFC2475){.xref}\], [Section
7](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2474#section-7){.relref} of
\[[RFC2474](#RFC2474){.xref}\], and [Section
3.3.2.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6274#section-3.3.2.1){.relref}
of \[[RFC6274](#RFC6274){.xref}\]) are also relevant to DetNet OT
traffic though perhaps in modified form. For example, in DetNet, the
effect of an undetected or incorrectly handled maliciously mismarked
DSCP field in an OT packet is not identical to affecting the PHB of that
packet, since DetNet does not use the PHB concept for OT traffic.
Nonetheless, the service provided to the packet could be affected, so
mitigation measures analogous to those prescribed by Diffserv would be
appropriate for DetNet. For example, mismarked DSCP values should not
cause failure of network nodes. The remarks in
\[[RFC2474](#RFC2474){.xref}\] regarding IPsec and Tunneling
Interactions are also relevant (though this is not to say that other
sections are less relevant).[¶](#section-4-3){.pilcrow}

In this discussion, interpretation (and any possible intentional
re-marking) of the DSCP values of packets destined for DetNet OT flows
is expected to occur at the ingress to the DetNet domain; once inside
the domain, maintaining the integrity of the DSCP values is subject to
the same handling considerations as any other field in the
packet.[¶](#section-4-4){.pilcrow}

This section presents a taxonomy of threats and analyzes the possible
threats in a DetNet-enabled network. The threats considered in this
section are independent of any specific technologies used to implement
the DetNet; [Section 10](#TechnologySpecificThreats){.xref} considers
attacks that are associated with the DetNet technologies encompassed by
\[[RFC8938](#RFC8938){.xref}\].[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

We distinguish controller plane threats from data plane threats. The
attack surface may be the same, but the types of attacks, as well as the
motivation behind them, are different. For example, a Delay attack is
more relevant to the data plane than to the controller plane. There is
also a difference in terms of security solutions; the way you secure the
data plane is often different than the way you secure the controller
plane.[¶](#section-5-2){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-5.1 .section}
### [5.1.](#section-5.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Threat Taxonomy](#name-threat-taxonomy){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-threat-taxonomy}

This document employs organizational elements of the threat models of
\[[RFC7384](#RFC7384){.xref}\] and \[[RFC7835](#RFC7835){.xref}\]. This
model classifies attackers based on two
criteria:[¶](#section-5.1-1){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

Internal vs. external:
:   Internal attackers either have access to a trusted segment of the
    network or possess the encryption or authentication keys. External
    attackers, on the other hand, do not have the keys and have access
    only to the encrypted or authenticated
    traffic.[¶](#section-5.1-2.2){.pilcrow}
:   

On-path vs. off-path:
:   On-path attackers are located in a position that allows
    interception, modification, or dropping of in-flight protocol
    packets, whereas off-path attackers can only attack by generating
    protocol packets.[¶](#section-5.1-2.4){.pilcrow}
:   

Regarding the boundary between internal vs. external attackers as
defined above, note that in this document we do not make concrete
recommendations regarding which specific segments of the network are to
be protected in any specific way, for example, via encryption or
authentication. As a result, the boundary as defined above is not
unequivocally specified here. Given that constraint, the reader can view
an internal attacker as one who can operate within the perimeter defined
by the DetNet Edge Nodes (as defined in the DetNet Architecture
\[[RFC8655](#RFC8655){.xref}\]), allowing that the specifics of what is
encrypted or authenticated within this perimeter will vary depending on
the implementation.[¶](#section-5.1-3){.pilcrow}

Care has also been taken to adhere to [Section
5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3552#section-5){.relref} of
\[[RFC3552](#RFC3552){.xref}\], both with respect to which attacks are
considered out of scope for this document, and also which are considered
to be the most common threats (explored further in [Section
5.2](#ThreatAnalysis){.xref}). Most of the direct threats to DetNet are
active attacks (i.e., attacks that modify DetNet traffic), but it is
highly suggested that DetNet application developers take appropriate
measures to protect the content of the DetNet flows from passive attacks
(i.e., attacks that observe but do not modify DetNet traffic), for
example, through the use of TLS or DTLS.[¶](#section-5.1-4){.pilcrow}

DetNet-Service, one of the service scenarios described in
\[[DETNET-SERVICE-MODEL](#I-D.varga-detnet-service-model){.xref}\], is
the case where a service connects DetNet islands, i.e., two or more
otherwise independent DetNets are connected via a link that is not
intrinsically part of either network. This implies that there could be
DetNet traffic flowing over a non-DetNet link, which may provide an
attacker with an advantageous opportunity to tamper with DetNet traffic.
The security properties of non-DetNet links are outside of the scope of
DetNet Security, but it should be noted that use of non-DetNet services
to interconnect DetNets merits security analysis to ensure the integrity
of the networks involved.[¶](#section-5.1-5){.pilcrow}

An attacker can maliciously delay DetNet data flow traffic. By delaying

An attacker can modify some header fields of en route packets in a way
that causes the DetNet flow identification mechanisms to misclassify the
flow. Alternatively, the attacker can inject traffic that is tailored to
appear as if it belongs to a legitimate DetNet flow. The potential
consequence is that the DetNet flow resource allocation cannot guarantee
the performance that is expected when the flow identification works
correctly.[¶](#section-5.2.2-1){.pilcrow}

DetNet components are expected to split their resources between DetNet
flows in a way that prevents traffic from one DetNet flow from affecting
the performance of other DetNet flows and also prevents non-DetNet
traffic from affecting DetNet flows. However, perhaps due to
implementation constraints, some resources may be partially shared, and
an attacker may try to exploit this property. For example, an attacker
can inject traffic in order to exhaust network resources such that
DetNet packets that share resources with the injected traffic may be
dropped or delayed. Such injected traffic may be part of DetNet flows or
non-DetNet traffic.[¶](#section-5.2.3-1){.pilcrow}

Another example of a Resource Segmentation attack is the case in which
an attacker is able to overload the exception path queue on the router,
i.e., a \"slow path\" typically taken by control or OAM packets that are
diverted from the data plane because they require processing by a CPU.
DetNet OT flows are typically configured to take the \"fast path\"
through the data plane to minimize latency. However, if there is only
one queue from the forwarding Application-Specific Integrated Circuit
(ASIC) to the exception path, and for some reason the system is
configured such that any DetNet packets must be handled on this
exception path, then saturating the exception path could result in the
delaying or dropping of DetNet packets.[¶](#section-5.2.3-2){.pilcrow}

An attacker can manipulate the replication-related header fields. This
capability opens the door for various types of attacks. For
example:[¶](#section-5.2.4.2-1){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

Forward both replicas:
:   Malicious change of a packet SN (Sequence Number) can cause both
    replicas of the packet to be forwarded. Note that this attack has a
    similar outcome to a replay
    attack.[¶](#section-5.2.4.2-2.2){.pilcrow}
:   

Eliminate both replicas:
:   SN manipulation can be used to cause both replicas to be eliminated.
    In this case, an attacker that has access to a single path can cause
    packets from other paths to be dropped, thus compromising some of
    the advantage of path redundancy.[¶](#section-5.2.4.2-2.4){.pilcrow}
:   

Flow hijacking:
:   An attacker can hijack a DetNet flow with access to a single path by
    systematically replacing the SNs on the given path with higher SN
    values. For example, an attacker can replace every SN value S with a
    higher value S+C, where C is a constant integer. Thus, the attacker
    creates a false illusion that the attacked path has the lowest
    delay, causing all packets from other paths to be eliminated in
    favor of the attacked path. Once the flow from the compromised path
    is favored by the eliminating bridge, the flow has effectively been
    hijacked by the attacker. It is now possible for the attacker to
    either replace en route packets with malicious packets, or to simply
    inject errors into the packets, causing the packets to be dropped at
    their destination.[¶](#section-5.2.4.2-2.6){.pilcrow}
:   

Amplification:
:   An attacker who injects packets into a flow that is to be replicated
    will have their attack amplified through the replication process.
    This is no different than any attacker who injects packets that are
    delivered through multicast, broadcast, or other
    point-to-multi-point mechanisms.[¶](#section-5.2.4.2-2.8){.pilcrow}

When designing security for a DetNet, as with any network, it may be
prohibitively expensive or technically infeasible to thoroughly protect
against every possible threat. Thus, the security designer must be
informed (for example, by an application domain expert such as a product
manager) regarding the relative significance of the various threats and
their impact if a successful attack is carried out. In this section, we
present an example of a possible template for such a communication,
culminating in a table ([Table 2](#ThreatIndustryMapping){.xref}) that
lists a set of threats under consideration, and some values
characterizing their relative impact in the context of a given industry.
The specific threats, industries, and impact values in the table are
provided only as an example of this kind of assessment and its
communication; they are not intended to be taken
literally.[¶](#section-6-1){.pilcrow}

This section considers assessment of the relative impacts of the attacks
described in [Section 5](#ThreatSection){.xref}. In this section, the
impacts as described assume that the associated mitigation is not
present or has failed. Mitigations are discussed in [Section
7](#ThreatMitigation){.xref}.[¶](#section-6-2){.pilcrow}

In computer security, the impact (or consequence) of an incident can be
measured in loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability of
information. In the case of OT or time sensitive networks (though not to
the exclusion of IT or non-time-sensitive networks), the impact of an
exploit can also include failure or malfunction of mechanical and/or
other physical systems.[¶](#section-6-3){.pilcrow}

DetNet raises these stakes significantly for OT applications,
particularly those that may have been designed to run in an OT-only
environment and thus may not have been designed for security in an IT
environment with its associated components, services, and
protocols.[¶](#section-6-4){.pilcrow}

The extent of impact of a successful vulnerability exploit varies
considerably by use case and by industry; additional insight regarding
the individual use cases is available from \"[Deterministic Networking
Use Cases](#RFC8578){.xref}\" \[[RFC8578](#RFC8578){.xref}\]. Each of
those use cases is represented in [Table
2](#ThreatIndustryMapping){.xref}, including Pro Audio, Electrical
Utilities, Industrial M2M (split into two areas: M2M Data Gathering and
M2M Control Loop), and others.[¶](#section-6-5){.pilcrow}

Aspects of Impact (left column) include Criticality of Failure, Effects
of Failure, Recovery, and DetNet Functional Dependence. Criticality of
failure summarizes the seriousness of the impact. The impact of a
resulting failure can affect many different metrics that vary greatly in
scope and severity. In order to reduce the number of variables, only the
following were included: Financial, Health and Safety, Effect on a
Single Organization, and Effect on Multiple Organizations. Recovery
outlines how long it would take for an affected use case to get back to
its pre-failure state (Recovery Time Objective, RTO) and how much of the
original service would be lost in between the time of service failure
and recovery to original state (Recovery Point Objective, RPO). DetNet
dependence maps how much the following DetNet service objectives
contribute to impact of failure: time dependency, data integrity, source
node integrity, availability, and
latency/jitter.[¶](#section-6-6){.pilcrow}

The scale of the Impact mappings is low, medium, and high. In some use
cases, there may be a multitude of specific applications in which DetNet
is used. For simplicity, this section attempts to average the varied
impacts of different applications. This section does not address the
overall risk of a certain impact that would require the likelihood of a
failure happening.[¶](#section-6-7){.pilcrow}

In practice, any such ratings will vary from case to case; the ratings
shown here are given as examples.[¶](#section-6-8){.pilcrow}

Note that \"Delay attack\" also includes the possibility of a \"negative
delay\" or early arrival of a packet, or possibly adversely changing the
timestamp value.[¶](#section-6.1.1-1){.pilcrow}

Delayed messages in a DetNet link can result in the same behavior as
dropped messages in ordinary networks, since the services attached to
the DetNet flow are likely to have strict delivery time
requirements.[¶](#section-6.1.1-2){.pilcrow}

For a single-path scenario, disruption within the single flow is a real
possibility. In a multipath scenario, large delays or instabilities in
one DetNet flow can also lead to increased buffer and processor resource
consumption at the eliminating router.[¶](#section-6.1.1-3){.pilcrow}

A data plane Delay attack on a system controlling substantial moving
devices, for example, in industrial automation, can cause physical
damage. For example, if the network promises a bounded latency of 2 ms
for a flow, yet the machine receives it with 5 ms latency, the control
loop of the machine may become unstable.[¶](#section-6.1.1-4){.pilcrow}

If the contents of a packet header or body can be modified by the

or the payload to be corrupted or subtly modified. Thus, the potential

Spoofing data plane messages can result in increased resource
consumption on the routers throughout the network as it will increase
buffer usage and processor utilization. This can lead to resource
exhaustion and/or increased delay.[¶](#section-6.2.2.1-1){.pilcrow}

If the attacker manages to create valid headers, the false messages can
be forwarded through the network, using part of the allocated bandwidth.
This in turn can cause legitimate messages to be dropped when the
resource budget has been exhausted.[¶](#section-6.2.2.1-2){.pilcrow}

Injection of false messages in a DetNet flow could lead to exhaustion of
the available bandwidth for that flow if the routers attribute these
false messages to the resource budget of that
flow.[¶](#section-6.3.1-1){.pilcrow}

In a multipath scenario, injected messages will cause increased
processor utilization in elimination routers. If enough paths are
subject to malicious injection, the legitimate messages can be dropped.
Likewise, it can cause an increase in buffer usage. In total, it will
consume more resources in the routers than normal, giving rise to a
resource-exhaustion attack on the
routers.[¶](#section-6.3.1-2){.pilcrow}

If a DetNet flow is interrupted, the end application will be affected by
what is now a non-deterministic flow. Note that there are many possible
sources of flow interruptions, for example, but not limited to, such
physical-layer conditions as a broken wire or a radio link that is

into a state that is not expected by the controller. At that point, if

An attacker can, at their leisure, observe over time various aspects of
the messaging and signaling, learning the intent and purpose of the
traffic flows. Then at some later date, possibly at an important time in
the operational context, they might launch an attack based on that
knowledge.[¶](#section-6.7-2){.pilcrow}

The flow ID in the header of the data plane messages gives an attacker a
very reliable identifier for DetNet traffic, and this traffic has a high
probability of going to lucrative targets.[¶](#section-6.7-3){.pilcrow}

Description:

:   Path redundancy is a DetNet flow that can be forwarded
    simultaneously over multiple paths. Packet Replication and
    Elimination \[[RFC8655](#RFC8655){.xref}\] provide resiliency to
    dropped or delayed packets. This redundancy improves the robustness

    Note: At the time of this writing, PREOF is not defined for the IP
    data plane.[¶](#section-7.1-1.2.2.1){.pilcrow}

:   

Related attacks:

:   Path redundancy can be used to mitigate various on-path attacks,
    including attacks described in Sections
    [5.2.1](#DelayThreat){.xref}, [5.2.2](#ModificationThreat){.xref},
    [5.2.3](#SegmentThreat){.xref}, and [5.2.7](#SyncThreat){.xref}.
    However, it is also possible that multiple paths may make it more
    difficult to locate the source of an on-path
    attacker.[¶](#section-7.1-1.4.1){.pilcrow}

    A Delay Modulation attack could result in extensively exercising

### [7.2.](#section-7.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Integrity Protection](#name-integrity-protection){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-integrity-protection}

[]{.break}

Description:

:   Integrity protection in the scope of DetNet is the ability to detect
    if a packet header has been modified (maliciously or otherwise) and
    if so, take some appropriate action (as discussed in [Section
    7.7](#DpaMitigation){.xref}). The decision on where in the network
    to apply integrity protection is part of the DetNet system design,
    and the implementation of the protection method itself is a part of
    a DetNet component design.[¶](#section-7.2-1.2.1){.pilcrow}

    The most common technique for detecting header modification is the
    use of a Message Authentication Code (MAC) (see [Section
    10](#TechnologySpecificThreats){.xref} for examples). The MAC can be
    distributed either in line (included in the same packet) or via a
    side channel. Of these, the in-line method is generally preferred
    due to the low latency that may be required on DetNet flows and the
    relative complexity and computational overhead of a sideband
    approach.[¶](#section-7.2-1.2.2){.pilcrow}

    There are different levels of security available for integrity
    protection, ranging from the basic ability to detect if a header has
    been corrupted in transit (no malicious attack) to stopping a
    skilled and determined attacker capable of both subtly modifying
    fields in the headers as well as updating an unkeyed checksum.
    Common for all are the 2 steps that need to be performed in both
    ends. The first is computing the checksum or MAC. The corresponding
    verification step must perform the same steps before comparing the
    provided with the computed value. Only then can the receiver be
    reasonably sure that the header is
    authentic.[¶](#section-7.2-1.2.3){.pilcrow}

    The most basic protection mechanism consists of computing a simple
    checksum of the header fields and providing it to the next entity in
    the packets path for verification. Using a MAC combined with a
    secret key provides the best protection against Modification and
    Replication attacks (see Sections
    [5.2.2](#ModificationThreat){.xref} and
    [5.2.4](#ReplicationThreat){.xref}). This MAC usage needs to be part
    of a security association that is established and managed by a
    security association protocol (such as IKEv2 for IPsec security
    associations). Integrity protection in the controller plane is
    discussed in [Section 7.6](#ControllerProtectSection){.xref}. The
    secret key, regardless of the MAC used, must be protected from
    falling into the hands of unauthorized users. Once key management
    becomes a topic, it is important to understand that this is a
    delicate process and should not be undertaken lightly. BCP 107
    \[[BCP107](#BCP107){.xref}\] provides best practices in this
    regard.[¶](#section-7.2-1.2.4){.pilcrow}

    DetNet system and/or component designers need to be aware of these
    distinctions and enforce appropriate integrity-protection mechanisms
    as needed based on a threat analysis. Note that adding
    integrity-protection mechanisms may introduce latency; thus, many of
    the same considerations in [Section
    7.5.1](#EncryptionConsiderations){.xref} also apply
    here.[¶](#section-7.2-1.2.5){.pilcrow}

:   

Packet Sequence Number Integrity Considerations:

:   The use of PREOF in a DetNet implementation implies the use of a
    sequence number for each packet. There is a trust relationship
    between the component that adds the sequence number and the
    component that removes the sequence number. The sequence number may
    be end-to-end source to destination, or it may be added/deleted by
    network edge components. The adder and remover(s) have the trust
    relationship because they are the ones that ensure that the sequence
    numbers are not modifiable. Thus, sequence numbers can be protected
    by using authenticated encryption or by a MAC without using
    encryption. Between the adder and remover there may or may not be
    replication and elimination functions. The elimination functions
    must be able to see the sequence numbers. Therefore, if encryption
    is done between adders and removers, it must not obscure the
    sequence number. If the sequence removers and the eliminators are in
    the same physical component, it may be possible to obscure the
    sequence number; however, that is a layer violation and is not
    recommended practice.[¶](#section-7.2-1.4.1){.pilcrow}

    data plane.[¶](#section-7.2-1.4.2.1){.pilcrow}

    Spoofing attacks. While integrity protection ([Section
    7.2](#IntegritySection){.xref}) prevents intermediate nodes from
    modifying information, authentication can provide traffic origin
    verification, i.e., to verify that each packet in a DetNet flow is
    from a known source. Although node authentication and integrity
    protection are two different goals of a security protocol, in most
    cases, a common protocol (such as IPsec
    \[[RFC4301](#RFC4301){.xref}\] or MACsec
    \[[IEEE802.1AE-2018](#IEEE802.1AE-2018){.xref}\]) is used for

[]{.break}

Description:
:   With some queuing methods such as
    \[[IEEE802.1Qch-2017](#IEEE802.1Qch-2017){.xref}\], it is possible
    to introduce synthetic traffic in order to regularize the timing of
    packet transmission. (Synthetic traffic typically consists of
    randomly generated packets injected in the network to mask
    observable transmission patterns in the flows, which may allow an
    attacker to gain insight into the content of the flows). This can
    subsequently reduce the value of passive monitoring from internal
    threats (see [Section 5](#ThreatSection){.xref}) as it will be much
    more difficult to associate discrete events with particular network
    packets.[¶](#section-7.4-1.2){.pilcrow}
:   

Related attacks:
:   Removing distinctive temporal properties of individual packets or
    flows can be used to mitigate against reconnaissance attacks
    ([Section 5.2.6](#ReconnaissanceThreat){.xref}). For example,
    synthetic traffic can be used to maintain constant traffic rate even
    when no user data is transmitted, thus making it difficult to
    collect information about the times at which users are active and
    the times at which DetNet flows are added or
    removed.[¶](#section-7.4-1.4){.pilcrow}
:   

Traffic Insertion Challenges:

:   Once an attacker is able to monitor the frames traversing a network
    to such a degree that they can differentiate between best-effort
    traffic and traffic belonging to a specific DetNet flow, it becomes
    difficult to not reveal to the attacker whether a given frame is
    valid traffic or an inserted frame. Thus, having the DetNet
    components generate and remove the synthetic traffic may or may not
    be a viable option unless certain challenges are solved; for
    example, but not limited to:[¶](#section-7.4-1.6.1){.pilcrow}

    -   [Inserted traffic must be indistinguishable from valid stream
        traffic from the viewpoint of the
        attacker.[¶](#section-7.4-1.6.2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-7.4-1.6.2.1}

    -   [DetNet components must be able to safely identify and remove
        all inserted traffic (and only inserted
        traffic).[¶](#section-7.4-1.6.2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-7.4-1.6.2.2}

    -   ::: {#section-7.4-1.6.2.3}
        The controller plane must manage where to insert and remove
        synthetic traffic, but this information must not be revealed to
        an attacker.[¶](#section-7.4-1.6.2.3.1){.pilcrow}

        An alternative design is to have the insertion and removal of
        synthetic traffic be performed at the application layer rather
        than by the DetNet itself. For example, the use of RTP padding
        to reduce information leakage from variable-bit-rate audio
        transmission via the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP)
        is discussed in
        \[[RFC6562](#RFC6562){.xref}\].[¶](#section-7.4-1.6.2.3.2){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

Description:

:   Reconnaissance attacks ([Section
    5.2.6](#ReconnaissanceThreat){.xref}) can be mitigated to some
    extent through the use of encryption, thereby preventing the
    attacker from accessing the packet header or contents. Specific
    encryption protocols will depend on the lower layers that DetNet is
    forwarded over. For example, IP flows may be forwarded over IPsec
    \[[RFC4301](#RFC4301){.xref}\], and Ethernet flows may be secured
    using MACsec
    \[[IEEE802.1AE-2018](#IEEE802.1AE-2018){.xref}\].[¶](#section-7.5-1.2.1){.pilcrow}

    However, despite the use of encryption, a reconnaissance attack can
    provide the attacker with insight into the network, even without
    visibility into the packet. For example, an attacker can observe
    which nodes are communicating with which other nodes, including
    when, how often, and with how much data. In addition, the timing of
    packets may be correlated in time with external events such as
    action of an external device. Such information may be used by the
    attacker, for example, in mapping out specific targets for a
    different type of attack at a different
    time.[¶](#section-7.5-1.2.2){.pilcrow}

    DetNet nodes do not have any need to inspect the payload of any
    DetNet packets, making them data agnostic. This means that
    end-to-end encryption at the application layer is an acceptable way
    to protect user data.[¶](#section-7.5-1.2.3){.pilcrow}

    Note that reconnaissance is a threat that is not specific to DetNet
    flows; therefore, reconnaissance mitigation will typically be
    analyzed and provided by a network operator regardless of whether
    DetNet flows are deployed. Thus, encryption requirements will
    typically not be defined in DetNet technology-specific
    specifications, but considerations of using DetNet in encrypted
    environments will be discussed in these specifications. For example,
    [Section
    5.1.2.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8939#section-5.1.2.3){.relref}
    of \[[RFC8939](#RFC8939){.xref}\] discusses flow identification of
    DetNet flows running over IPsec.[¶](#section-7.5-1.2.4){.pilcrow}

:   

Related attacks:
:   As noted above, encryption can be used to mitigate reconnaissance
    attacks ([Section 5.2.6](#ReconnaissanceThreat){.xref}). However,
    for a DetNet to provide differentiated quality of service on a
    flow-by-flow basis, the network must be able to identify the flows
    individually. This implies that in a reconnaissance attack, the
    attacker may also be able to track individual flows to learn more
    about the system.[¶](#section-7.5-1.4){.pilcrow}

#### [7.5.1.](#section-7.5.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Encryption Considerations for DetNet](#name-encryption-considerations-f){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-encryption-considerations-f}

Any compute time that is required for encryption and decryption
processing (\"crypto\") must be included in the flow latency
calculations. Thus, cryptographic algorithms used in a DetNet must have
bounded worst-case execution times, and these values must be used in the
latency calculations. Fortunately, encryption and decryption operations
typically are designed to have constant execution times in order to
avoid side channel leakage.[¶](#section-7.5.1-1){.pilcrow}

Some cryptographic algorithms are symmetric in encode/decode time (such
as AES), and others are asymmetric (such as public key algorithms).
There are advantages and disadvantages to the use of either type in a
given DetNet context. The discussion in this document relates to the
timing implications of crypto for DetNet; it is assumed that integrity
considerations are covered elsewhere in the
literature.[¶](#section-7.5.1-2){.pilcrow}

Asymmetrical crypto is typically not used in networks on a
packet-by-packet basis due to its computational cost. For example, if
only endpoint checks or checks at a small number of intermediate points
are required, asymmetric crypto can be used to authenticate distribution
or exchange of a secret symmetric crypto key; a successful check based
on that key will provide traffic origin verification as long as the key
is kept secret by the participants. TLS (v1.3
\[[RFC8446](#RFC8446){.xref}\], in particular, Section
[4.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8446#section-4.1){.relref}
([\"Key Exchange
Messages\"](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8446#section-4.1){.relref}))
and IKEv2 \[[RFC6071](#RFC6071){.xref}\] are examples of this for
endpoint checks.[¶](#section-7.5.1-3){.pilcrow}

However, if secret symmetric keys are used for this purpose, the key
must be given to all relays, which increases the probability of a secret
key being leaked. Also, if any relay is compromised or faulty, then it
may inject traffic into the flow. Group key management protocols can be
used to automate management of such symmetric keys; for an example in
the context of IPsec, see
\[[IPSECME-G-IKEV2](#I-D.ietf-ipsecme-g-ikev2){.xref}\].[¶](#section-7.5.1-4){.pilcrow}

Alternatively, asymmetric crypto can provide traffic origin verification
at every intermediate node. For example, a DetNet flow can be associated
with an (asymmetric) keypair, such that the private key is available to
the source of the flow and the public key is distributed with the flow
information, allowing verification at every node for every packet.
However, this is more computationally
expensive.[¶](#section-7.5.1-5){.pilcrow}

In either case, origin verification also requires replay detection as
part of the security protocol to prevent an attacker from recording and
resending traffic, e.g., as a denial-of-service attack on flow
forwarding resources.[¶](#section-7.5.1-6){.pilcrow}

In the general case, cryptographic hygiene requires the generation of
new keys during the lifetime of an encrypted flow (e.g., see [Section
9](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4253#section-9){.relref} of
\[[RFC4253](#RFC4253){.xref}\]), and any such key generation (or key
exchange) requires additional computing time, which must be accounted
for in the latency calculations for that flow. For modern ECDH
(Elliptical Curve Diffie-Hellman) key-exchange operations (such as
x25519 \[[RFC7748](#RFC7748){.xref}\]), these operations can be
performed in constant (predictable) time; however, this is not
universally true (for example, for legacy RSA key exchange
\[[RFC4432](#RFC4432){.xref}\]). Thus, implementers should be aware of
the time properties of these algorithms and avoid algorithms that make
constant-time implementation difficult or
impossible.[¶](#section-7.5.1-7){.pilcrow}

Description:
:   Control and signaling messages can be protected through the use of
    any or all of encryption, authentication, and integrity-protection
    mechanisms. Compared with data flows, the timing constraints for
    controller and signaling messages may be less strict, and the number
    of such packets may be fewer. If that is the case in a given
    application, then it may enable the use of asymmetric cryptography
    for the signing of both payload and headers for such messages, as
    well as encrypting the payload. Given that a DetNet is managed by a
    central controller, the use of a shared public key approach for
    these processes is well proven. This is further discussed in

[]{.break}

Description:

:   Incorporating Dynamic Performance Analytics (DPA) implies that the
    DetNet design includes a performance monitoring system to validate
    that timing guarantees are being met and to detect timing violations
    or other anomalies that may be the symptom of a security attack or
    system malfunction. If this monitoring system detects unexpected
    behavior, it must then cause action to be initiated to address the
    situation in an appropriate and timely manner, either at the data
    plane or controller plane or both in
    concert.[¶](#section-7.7-1.2.1){.pilcrow}

    The overall DPA system can thus be decomposed into the \"detection\"
    and \"notification\" functions. Although the time-specific DPA
    performance indicators and their implementation will likely be
    specific to a given DetNet, and as such are nascent technology at
    the time of this writing, DPA is commonly used in existing networks
    so we can make some observations on how such a system might be
    implemented for a DetNet given that it would need to be adapted to
    address the time-specific performance
    indicators.[¶](#section-7.7-1.2.2){.pilcrow}

Notification Mechanisms:

:   Making DPA measurement results available at the right place(s) and
    time(s) to effect timely response can be challenging. Two
    notification mechanisms that are in general use are NETCONF/YANG
    Notifications and the proprietary local telemetry interfaces
    provided with components from some vendors. The Constrained
    Application Protocol (CoAP) Observe Option
    \[[RFC7641](#RFC7641){.xref}\] could also be relevant to such
    scenarios.[¶](#section-7.7-1.6.1){.pilcrow}

    At the time of this writing, YANG Notifications are not addressed by
    the DetNet YANG documents; however, this may be a topic for future
    work. It is possible that some of the passive mechanisms could be
    covered by notifications from non-DetNet-specific YANG modules; for
    example, if there is OAM or other performance monitoring that can
    monitor delay bounds, then that could have its own associated YANG
    data model, which could be relevant to DetNet, for example, some
    \"threshold\" values for timing measurement
    notifications.[¶](#section-7.7-1.6.2){.pilcrow}

    At the time of this writing, there is an IETF Working Group for
    network/performance monitoring (IP Performance Metrics (IPPM)). See
    also previous work by the completed Remote Network Monitoring
    Working Group (RMONMIB). See also \"[An Overview of the IETF Network
    Management Standards](#RFC6632){.xref}\",
    \[[RFC6632](#RFC6632){.xref}\].[¶](#section-7.7-1.6.3){.pilcrow}

    Vendor-specific local telemetry may be available on some
    commercially available systems, whereby the system can be programmed
    (via a proprietary dedicated port and API) to monitor and report on
    specific conditions, based on both passive and active
    measurements.[¶](#section-7.7-1.6.4){.pilcrow}

Related attacks:

:   Performance analytics can be used to detect various attacks,
    including the ones described in [Section 5.2.1](#DelayThreat){.xref}
    (Delay attack), [Section 5.2.3](#SegmentThreat){.xref} (Resource
    Segmentation attack), and [Section 5.2.7](#SyncThreat){.xref}
    (Time-Synchronization attack). Once detection and notification have
    occurred, the appropriate action can be taken to mitigate the
    threat.[¶](#section-7.7-1.8.1){.pilcrow}

    For example, in the case of data plane Delay attacks, one possible
    mitigation is to timestamp the data at the source and timestamp it
    again at the destination, and if the resulting latency does not meet
    the service agreement, take appropriate action. Note that DetNet
    specifies packet sequence numbering; however, it does not specify
    use of packet timestamps, although they may be used by the
    underlying transport (for example, TSN

## [8.](#section-8){.section-number .selfRef} [Association of Attacks to Use Cases](#name-association-of-attacks-to-u){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-association-of-attacks-to-u}

Different attacks can have different impact and/or mitigation depending
on the use case, so we would like to make this association in our
analysis. However, since there is a potentially unbounded list of use
cases, we categorize the attacks with respect to the common themes of
the use cases as identified in [Section
11](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8578#section-11){.relref} of
\[[RFC8578](#RFC8578){.xref}\].[¶](#section-8-1){.pilcrow}

impact of attacks per use case by industry.[¶](#section-8-2){.pilcrow}

In this section, we review each theme and discuss the attacks that are
applicable to that theme, as well as anything specific about the impact
and mitigations for that attack with respect to that theme. [Table
5](#ThemeAttackMapping){.xref}, Mapping between Themes and Attacks, then
provides a summary of the attacks that are applicable to each
theme.[¶](#section-8.1-1){.pilcrow}

#### [8.1.1.](#section-8.1.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Sub-network Layer](#name-sub-network-layer){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-sub-network-layer}

DetNet is expected to run over various transmission mediums, with
Ethernet being the first identified. Attacks such as Delay or
Reconnaissance might be implemented differently on a different
transmission medium; however, the impact on the DetNet as a whole would
be essentially the same. We thus conclude that all attacks and impacts
that would be applicable to DetNet over Ethernet (i.e., all those named
in this document) would also be applicable to DetNet over other
transmission mediums.[¶](#section-8.1.1-1){.pilcrow}

With respect to mitigations, some methods are specific to the Ethernet
medium, for example, time-aware scheduling using 802.1Qbv
\[[IEEE802.1Qbv-2015](#IEEE802.1Qbv-2015){.xref}\] can protect against
excessive use of bandwidth at the ingress \-- for other mediums, other
mitigations would have to be implemented to provide analogous
protection.[¶](#section-8.1.1-2){.pilcrow}

#### [8.1.2.](#section-8.1.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Central Administration](#name-central-administration){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-central-administration}

A DetNet network can be controlled by a centralized network
configuration and control system. Such a system may be in a single
central location, or it may be distributed across multiple control
entities that function together as a unified control system for the
network.[¶](#section-8.1.2-1){.pilcrow}

All attacks named in this document that are relevant to controller plane
packets (and the controller itself) are relevant to this theme,
including Path Manipulation, Path Choice, Control Packet Modification or
Injection, Reconnaissance, and Attacks on Time-Synchronization
Mechanisms.[¶](#section-8.1.2-2){.pilcrow}

#### [8.1.3.](#section-8.1.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Hot Swap](#name-hot-swap){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-hot-swap}

A DetNet network is not expected to be \"plug and play\"; it is expected
that there is some centralized network configuration and control system.
However, the ability to \"hot swap\" components (e.g., due to
malfunction) is similar enough to \"plug and play\" that this kind of
behavior may be expected in DetNet networks, depending on the
implementation.[¶](#section-8.1.3-1){.pilcrow}

An attack surface related to hot swap is that the DetNet network must at
least consider input at runtime from components that were not part of
the initial configuration of the network. Even a \"perfect\" (or
\"hitless\") replacement of a component at runtime would not necessarily
be ideal, since presumably one would want to distinguish it from the
original for OAM purposes (e.g., to report hot swap of a failed
component).[¶](#section-8.1.3-2){.pilcrow}

This implies that an attack such as Flow Modification, Spoofing, or
Inter-segment (which could introduce packets from a \"new\" component,
i.e., one heretofore unknown on the network) could be used to exploit
the need to consider such packets (as opposed to rejecting them out of
hand as one would do if one did not have to consider introduction of a
new component).[¶](#section-8.1.3-3){.pilcrow}

To mitigate this situation, deployments should provide a method for
dynamic and secure registration of new components, and (possibly manual)
deregistration and re-keying of retired components. This would avoid the
situation in which the network must accommodate potentially insecure
packet flows from unknown components.[¶](#section-8.1.3-4){.pilcrow}

Similarly, if the network was designed to support runtime replacement of
a clock component, then presence (or apparent presence) and thus
consideration of packets from a new such component could affect the
network, or the time synchronization of the network, for example, by
initiating a new Best Master Clock selection process. These types of
attacks should therefore be considered when designing hot-swap-type
functionality (see
\[[RFC7384](#RFC7384){.xref}\]).[¶](#section-8.1.3-5){.pilcrow}

A DetNet network integrates Layer 2 (bridged) networks (e.g., AVB/TSN
LAN) and Layer 3 (routed) networks (e.g., IP) via the use of well-known
protocols such as IP, MPLS Pseudowire, and Ethernet. Various DetNet
documents address many specific aspects of Layer 2 and Layer 3
integration within a DetNet, and these are not individually referenced
here; security considerations for those aspects are covered within those
documents or within the related subsections of the present
document.[¶](#section-8.1.5-1){.pilcrow}

Packets that are part of a resource-reserved DetNet flow are not to be
dropped by the DetNet due to congestion. Packets may however be dropped
for intended reasons, for example, security measures. For example,
consider the case in which a packet becomes corrupted (whether
incidentally or maliciously) such that the resulting flow ID
incidentally matches the flow ID of another DetNet flow, potentially
resulting in additional unauthorized traffic on the latter. In such a
case, it may be a security requirement that the system report and/or
take some defined action, perhaps when a packet drop count threshold has
been reached (see also [Section
7.7](#DpaMitigation){.xref}).[¶](#section-8.1.6-1){.pilcrow}

A data plane attack may force packets to be dropped, for example, as a
result of a Delay attack, Replication/Elimination attack, or Flow
Modification attack.[¶](#section-8.1.6-2){.pilcrow}

The same result might be obtained by a Controller plane attack, e.g.,
Path Manipulation or Signaling Packet
Modification.[¶](#section-8.1.6-3){.pilcrow}

An attack may also cause packets that should not be delivered to be
delivered, such as by forcing packets from one (e.g., replicated) path
to be preferred over another path when they should not be (Replication
attack), or by Flow Modification, or Path Choice or Packet Injection. A
Time-Synchronization attack could cause a system that was expecting
certain packets at certain times to accept unintended packets based on
compromised system time or time windowing in the
scheduler.[¶](#section-8.1.6-4){.pilcrow}

There are many proprietary \"fieldbuses\" used in Industrial and other
industries, as well as proprietary non-interoperable deterministic
Ethernet-based networks. DetNet is intended to provide an
open-standards-based alternative to such buses/networks. In cases where
a DetNet intersects with such fieldbuses/networks or their protocols,
such as by protocol emulation or access via a gateway, new attack
surfaces can be opened.[¶](#section-8.1.7-1){.pilcrow}

For example, an Inter-segment or Controller plane attack such as Path

Most of the themes described in this document address OT (reserved)
DetNet flows \-- this item is intended to address issues related to IT
traffic on a DetNet.[¶](#section-8.1.8-1){.pilcrow}

DetNet is intended to support coexistence of time-sensitive operational
(OT, deterministic) traffic and informational (IT, \"best effort\")
traffic on the same (\"unified\")
network.[¶](#section-8.1.8-2){.pilcrow}

With DetNet, this coexistence will become more common, and mitigations
will need to be established. The fact that the IT traffic on a DetNet is
limited to a corporate-controlled network makes this a less difficult
problem compared to being exposed to the open Internet; however, this
aspect of DetNet security should not be
underestimated.[¶](#section-8.1.8-3){.pilcrow}

An Inter-segment attack can flood the network with IT-type traffic with
the intent of disrupting the handling of IT traffic and/or the goal of
interfering with OT traffic. Presumably, if the DetNet flow reservation
and isolation of the DetNet is well designed (better-designed than the
attack), then interference with OT traffic should not result from an
attack that floods the network with IT
traffic.[¶](#section-8.1.8-4){.pilcrow}

The handling of IT traffic (i.e., traffic that by definition is not
guaranteed any given deterministic service properties) by the DetNet
will by definition not be given the DetNet-specific protections provided
to DetNet (resource-reserved) flows. The implication is that the IT
traffic on the DetNet network will necessarily have its own specific set
of product (component or system) requirements for protection against
attacks such as DoS; presumably they will be less stringent than those
for OT flows, but nonetheless, component and system designers must
employ whatever mitigations will meet the specified security
requirements for IT traffic for the given component or
DetNet.[¶](#section-8.1.8-5){.pilcrow}

The network design as a whole also needs to consider possible
application-level dependencies of OT-type applications on services
provided by the IT part of the network; for example, does the OT
application depend on IT network services such as DNS or OAM? If such
dependencies exist, how are malicious packet flows handled? Such
considerations are typically outside the scope of DetNet proper, but
nonetheless need to be addressed in the overall DetNet network design
for a given use case.[¶](#section-8.1.8-6){.pilcrow}

A Spoofing or Inter-segment attack that adds packet traffic to a

bandwidth than it was allocated, resulting in interference with other
DetNet flows.[¶](#section-8.1.9-2){.pilcrow}

available on the network for best-effort traffic. However, note that
security considerations for best-effort traffic on a DetNet network is

The DetNet specifications as a whole are intended to enable an ecosystem
in which multiple vendors can create interoperable products, thus
promoting component diversity and potentially higher numbers of each
component manufactured. Toward that end, the security measures and
protocols discussed in this document are intended to encourage
interoperability.[¶](#section-8.1.11-1){.pilcrow}

Given that the DetNet specifications are unambiguously written and that
the implementations are accurate, the property of interoperability
should not in and of itself cause security concerns; however, flaws in
interoperability between components could result in security weaknesses.
The network operator, as well as system and component designers, can all
contribute to reducing such weaknesses through interoperability
testing.[¶](#section-8.1.11-2){.pilcrow}

This envisioned breadth of DetNet-enabled products is in general a

differences between components from different vendors can result in
attack surfaces (resulting from their interaction) that may not exist in

The DetNet network specifications are intended to enable an ecosystem in
which multiple vendors can create interoperable products, thus promoting
component diversity and potentially higher numbers of each component

repurpose for DetNet applications a hardware or software component that
was originally designed for operation in an isolated OT network and thus
may not have been designed to be sufficiently secure, or secure at all,
against the sorts of attacks described in this document. Deployment of
such a component on a DetNet network that is intended to be highly
secure may present an attack surface; thus, the DetNet network operator
may need to take specific actions to protect such components, for
example, by implementing a secure interface (such as a firewall) to
isolate the component from the threats that may be present in the
greater network.[¶](#section-8.1.13-1){.pilcrow}

industrial machine, to very large, e.g., a Utility Grid network spanning
a whole country.[¶](#section-8.1.14-1){.pilcrow}

The size of the network might be related to how the attack is introduced

a threat that power can be cut to the entire network. If the network is
large, perhaps only a part of the network is
attacked.[¶](#section-8.1.14-2){.pilcrow}

A Delay attack might be as relevant to a small network as to a large
network, although the amount of delay might be
different.[¶](#section-8.1.14-3){.pilcrow}

Attacks sourced from IT traffic might be more likely in large networks
since more people might have access to the network, presenting a larger
attack surface. Similarly, Path Manipulation, Path Choice, and

networks.[¶](#section-8.1.14-4){.pilcrow}

An attacker who has knowledge of the operation of a component or

take advantage of this knowledge to design an attack that could exploit
flaws (or even the specifics of normal operation) in the communication
between the various links.[¶](#section-8.1.15-2){.pilcrow}

It is also possible that a large-scale DetNet topology containing
various kinds of links may not be in as common use as other more
homogeneous topologies. This situation may present more opportunity for
attackers to exploit software and/or protocol flaws in or between these
components because these components or configurations may not have been
sufficiently tested for interoperability (in the way they would be as a
result of broad usage). This may be of particular concern to early
adopters of new DetNet components or

A DetNet is expected to provide means to configure the network that

for a given path or DetNet flow, and so on. It is an expected case that

service level is not available (as opposed to accepting the parameter
but then not delivering the desired
behavior).[¶](#section-8.1.16-1){.pilcrow}

every DetNet depends to a greater or lesser degree on reliability and

of designing \"extremely high reliability\"

## [9.](#section-9){.section-number .selfRef} [Security Considerations for OAM Traffic](#name-security-considerations-for-){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-security-considerations-for-}

This section considers DetNet-specific security considerations for
packet traffic that is generated and transmitted over a DetNet as part
of OAM (Operations, Administration, and Maintenance). For the purposes
of this discussion, OAM traffic falls into one of two basic
types:[¶](#section-9-1){.pilcrow}

-   [OAM traffic generated by the network itself. The additional
    bandwidth required for such packets is added by the network
    administration, presumably transparent to the customer. Security
    considerations for such traffic are not DetNet specific (apart from
    such traffic being subject to the same DetNet-specific security
    considerations as any other DetNet data flow) and are thus not
    covered in this
    document.[¶](#section-9-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-9-2.1}
-   [OAM traffic generated by the customer. From a DetNet security point
    of view, DetNet security considerations for such traffic are exactly
    the same as for any other customer data
    flows.[¶](#section-9-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-9-2.2}

From the perspective of an attack, OAM traffic is indistinguishable from
DetNet traffic, and the network needs to be secure against injection,
removal, or modification of traffic of any kind, including OAM traffic.
A DetNet is sensitive to any form of packet injection, removal, or
manipulation, and in this respect DetNet OAM traffic is no different.
Techniques for securing a DetNet against these threats have been
discussed elsewhere in this document.[¶](#section-9-3){.pilcrow}

## [10.](#section-10){.section-number .selfRef} [DetNet Technology-Specific Threats](#name-detnet-technology-specific-){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-detnet-technology-specific-}

[Section 5](#ThreatSection){.xref}, [Security
Threats](#ThreatSection){.xref}, describes threats that are independent
of a DetNet implementation. This section considers threats specifically
related to the IP- and MPLS-specific aspects of DetNet
implementations.[¶](#section-10-1){.pilcrow}

The primary security considerations for the data plane specifically are
to maintain the integrity of the data and the delivery of the associated
DetNet service traversing the DetNet
network.[¶](#section-10-2){.pilcrow}

The primary relevant differences between IP and MPLS implementations are
in flow identification and OAM
methodologies.[¶](#section-10-3){.pilcrow}

As noted in \[[RFC8655](#RFC8655){.xref}\], DetNet operates at the IP
layer \[[RFC8939](#RFC8939){.xref}\] and delivers service over sub-layer
technologies such as MPLS \[[RFC8964](#RFC8964){.xref}\] and IEEE 802.1
Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) \[[RFC9023](#RFC9023){.xref}\].
Application flows can be protected through whatever means are provided
by the layer and sub-layer technologies. For example,
technology-specific encryption may be used for IP flows (IPsec
\[[RFC4301](#RFC4301){.xref}\]). For IP-over-Ethernet (Layer 2) flows
using an underlying sub-net, MACsec
\[[IEEE802.1AE-2018](#IEEE802.1AE-2018){.xref}\] may be appropriate. For
some use cases, packet integrity protection without encryption may be
sufficient.[¶](#section-10-4){.pilcrow}

However, if the DetNet nodes cannot decrypt IPsec traffic, then DetNet
flow identification for encrypted IP traffic flows must be performed in
a different way than it would be for unencrypted IP DetNet flows. The
DetNet IP data plane identifies unencrypted flows via a 6-tuple that
consists of two IP addresses, the transport protocol ID, two transport
protocol port numbers, and the DSCP in the IP header. When IPsec is
used, the transport header is encrypted and the next protocol ID is an
IPsec protocol, usually Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP), and not a
transport protocol, leaving only three components of the 6-tuple, which
are the two IP addresses and the DSCP. If the IPsec sessions are
established by a controller, then this controller could also transmit
(in the clear) the Security Parameter Index (SPI) and thus the SPI could
be used (in addition to the pair of IP addresses) for flow
identification. Identification of DetNet flows over IPsec is further
discussed in [Section
5.1.2.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8939#section-5.1.2.3){.relref}
of \[[RFC8939](#RFC8939){.xref}\].[¶](#section-10-5){.pilcrow}

Sections below discuss threats specific to IP and MPLS in more
detail.[¶](#section-10-6){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-10.1 .section}
### [10.1.](#section-10.1){.section-number .selfRef} [IP](#name-ip){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-ip}

IP has a long history of security considerations and architectural
protection mechanisms. From a data plane perspective, DetNet does not
add or modify any IP header information, so the carriage of DetNet
traffic over an IP data plane does not introduce any new security issues
that were not there before, apart from those already described in the
data-plane-independent threats section ([Section
5](#ThreatSection){.xref}).[¶](#section-10.1-1){.pilcrow}

Thus, the security considerations for a DetNet based on an IP data plane
are purely inherited from the rich IP security literature and
code/application base, and the data-plane-independent section of this
document.[¶](#section-10.1-2){.pilcrow}

Maintaining security for IP segments of a DetNet may be more challenging
than for the MPLS segments of the network given that the IP segments of
the network may reach the edges of the network, which are more likely to
involve interaction with potentially malevolent outside actors.
Conversely, MPLS is inherently more secure than IP since it is internal
to routers and it is well known how to protect it from outside
influence.[¶](#section-10.1-3){.pilcrow}

Another way to look at DetNet IP security is to consider it in the light
of VPN security. As an industry, we have a lot of experience with VPNs
running through networks with other VPNs \-- it is well known how to
secure the network for that. However, for a DetNet, we have the
additional subtlety that any possible interaction of one packet with
another can have a potentially deleterious effect on the time properties
of the flows. So the network must provide sufficient isolation between
flows, for example, by protecting the forwarding bandwidth and related
resources so that they are available to DetNet traffic, by whatever
means are appropriate for the data plane of that network, for example,
through the use of queuing mechanisms.[¶](#section-10.1-4){.pilcrow}

In a VPN, bandwidth is generally guaranteed over a period of time
whereas in DetNet, it is not aggregated over time. This implies that any
VPN-type protection mechanism must also maintain the DetNet timing
constraints.[¶](#section-10.1-5){.pilcrow}
:::

::: {#section-10.2 .section}
### [10.2.](#section-10.2){.section-number .selfRef} [MPLS](#name-mpls){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-mpls}

An MPLS network carrying DetNet traffic is expected to be a
\"well-managed\" network. Given that this is the case, it is difficult
for an attacker to pass a raw MPLS-encoded packet into a network because
operators have considerable experience at excluding such packets at the
network boundaries as well as excluding MPLS packets being inserted
through the use of a tunnel.[¶](#section-10.2-1){.pilcrow}

MPLS security is discussed extensively in \[[RFC5920](#RFC5920){.xref}\]
(\"[Security Framework for MPLS and GMPLS Networks](#RFC5920){.xref}\")
to which the reader is referred.[¶](#section-10.2-2){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC6941](#RFC6941){.xref}\] builds on \[[RFC5920](#RFC5920){.xref}\]
by providing additional security considerations that are applicable to
the MPLS-TP extensions appropriate to the MPLS Transport Profile
\[[RFC5921](#RFC5921){.xref}\] and thus to the operation of DetNet over
some types of MPLS network.[¶](#section-10.2-3){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC5921](#RFC5921){.xref}\] introduces to MPLS new Operations,
Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) capabilities; a transport-oriented
path protection mechanism; and strong emphasis on static provisioning
supported by network management systems.[¶](#section-10.2-4){.pilcrow}

The operation of DetNet over an MPLS network builds on MPLS and
pseudowire encapsulation. Thus, for guidance on securing the DetNet
elements of DetNet over MPLS, the reader is also referred to the
security considerations of \[[RFC4385](#RFC4385){.xref}\],
\[[RFC5586](#RFC5586){.xref}\], \[[RFC3985](#RFC3985){.xref}\],
\[[RFC6073](#RFC6073){.xref}\], and
\[[RFC6478](#RFC6478){.xref}\].[¶](#section-10.2-5){.pilcrow}

Having attended to the conventional aspects of network security, it is
necessary to attend to the dynamic aspects. The closest experience that
the IETF has with securing protocols that are sensitive to manipulation
of delay are the two-way time transfer (TWTT) protocols, which are NTP
\[[RFC5905](#RFC5905){.xref}\] and the Precision Time Protocol
\[[IEEE1588](#IEEE1588){.xref}\]. The security requirements for these
are described in
\[[RFC7384](#RFC7384){.xref}\].[¶](#section-10.2-6){.pilcrow}

One particular problem that has been observed in operational tests of
TWTT protocols is the ability for two closely but not completely
synchronized flows to beat and cause a sudden phase hit to one of the
flows. This can be mitigated by the careful use of a scheduling system
in the underlying packet transport.[¶](#section-10.2-7){.pilcrow}

Some investigations into protection of MPLS systems against dynamic
attacks exist, such as
\[[MPLS-OPP-ENCRYPT](#I-D.ietf-mpls-opportunistic-encrypt){.xref}\];
perhaps deployment of DetNets will encourage additional such
investigations.[¶](#section-10.2-8){.pilcrow}

Privacy in the context of DetNet is maintained by the base technologies
specific to the DetNet and user traffic. For example, TSN can use
MACsec, IP can use IPsec, and applications can use IP transport
protocol-provided methods, e.g., TLS and DTLS. MPLS typically uses L2/L3
VPNs combined with the previously mentioned privacy
methods.[¶](#section-13-1){.pilcrow}

However, note that reconnaissance threats such as traffic analysis and
monitoring of electrical side channels can still cause there to be
privacy considerations even when traffic is
encrypted.[¶](#section-13-2){.pilcrow}
