This document describes a HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Application
Programming Interface (API) that allows clients to interact with a
Captive Portal system. The API defined in this document has been
designed to meet the requirements in the Captive Portal Architecture
\[[CAPPORT-ARCH](#I-D.ietf-capport-architecture){.xref}\]. Specifically,
the API provides:[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

-   [The state of captivity (whether or not the client has access to the
    Internet).[¶](#section-1-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-2.1}
-   [A URI of a user-facing web portal that can be used to get out of
    captivity.[¶](#section-1-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-2.2}
-   [Authenticated and encrypted connections, using TLS for connections
    to both the API and user-facing web
    portal.[¶](#section-1-2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-2.3}

This document leverages the terminology and components described in
\[[CAPPORT-ARCH](#I-D.ietf-capport-architecture){.xref}\] and
additionally defines the following terms:[¶](#section-2-1){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

Captive Portal Client
:   The client that interacts with the Captive Portal API is typically
    some application running on the user equipment that is connected to
    the captive network. This is also referred to as the \"client\" in
    this document.[¶](#section-2-2.2){.pilcrow}
:   

Captive Portal API Server
:   The server exposing the APIs defined in this document to the client.
    This is also referred to as the \"API server\" in this
    document.[¶](#section-2-2.4){.pilcrow}
:   

The key words \"[MUST]{.bcp14}\", \"[MUST NOT]{.bcp14}\",
\"[REQUIRED]{.bcp14}\", \"[SHALL]{.bcp14}\", \"[SHALL NOT]{.bcp14}\",
\"[SHOULD]{.bcp14}\", \"[SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14}\",
\"[RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14}\", \"[NOT RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14}\",
\"[MAY]{.bcp14}\", and \"[OPTIONAL]{.bcp14}\" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in BCP 14 \[[RFC2119](#RFC2119){.xref}\]
\[[RFC8174](#RFC8174){.xref}\] when, and only when, they appear in all
capitals, as shown here.[¶](#section-2-3){.pilcrow}
:::
:::

::: {#workflow}
::: {#section-3 .section}
## [3.](#section-3){.section-number .selfRef} [Workflow](#name-workflow){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-workflow}

The Captive Portal Architecture defines several categories of
interaction between clients and Captive Portal
systems:[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

1.  [Provisioning, in which a client discovers that a network has a
    captive portal and learns the URI of the API
    server.[¶](#section-3-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-2.1}
2.  [API Server interaction, in which a client queries the state of
    captivity and retrieves the necessary information to get out of
    captivity[¶](#section-3-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-2.2}
3.  [Enforcement, in which the enforcement device in the network blocks
    disallowed traffic.[¶](#section-3-2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-2.3}

This document defines the mechanisms used in the second category. It is
assumed that the location of the Captive Portal API server has been
discovered by the client as part of provisioning. A set of mechanisms
for discovering the API server endpoint is defined in
\[[RFC8910](#RFC8910){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3-3){.pilcrow}
:::
:::

::: {#api-details}
::: {#section-4 .section}
## [4.](#section-4){.section-number .selfRef} [API Connection Details](#name-api-connection-details){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-api-connection-details}

The API server endpoint [MUST]{.bcp14} be accessed over HTTP using an
https URI \[[RFC2818](#RFC2818){.xref}\] and [SHOULD]{.bcp14} use the
default https port. For example, if the Captive Portal API server is
hosted at \"example.org\", the URI of the API could be
\"https://example.org/captive-portal/api\".[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

The client [SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} assume that the URI of the API server
for a given network will stay the same and [SHOULD]{.bcp14} rely on the
discovery or provisioning process each time it joins the
network.[¶](#section-4-2){.pilcrow}

As described in [Section
3](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-capport-architecture-08#section-3){.relref}
of \[[CAPPORT-ARCH](#I-D.ietf-capport-architecture){.xref}\], the
identity of the client needs to be visible to the Captive Portal API
server in order for the server to correctly reply with the client\'s
portal state. If the identifier used by the Captive Portal system is the
client\'s set of IP addresses, the system needs to ensure that the same
IP addresses are visible to both the API server and the enforcement
device.[¶](#section-4-3){.pilcrow}

If the API server needs information about the client identity that is
not otherwise visible to it, the URI provided to the client during
provisioning [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be distinct per client. Thus, depending on
how the Captive Portal system is configured, the URI will be unique for
each client host and between sessions for the same client
host.[¶](#section-4-4){.pilcrow}

For example, a Captive Portal system that uses per-client session URIs
could use \"https://example.org/captive-portal/api/X54PD39JV\" as its
API URI.[¶](#section-4-5){.pilcrow}

::: {#server-auth}
::: {#section-4.1 .section}
### [4.1.](#section-4.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Server Authentication](#name-server-authentication){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-server-authentication}

The purpose of accessing the Captive Portal API over an HTTPS connection
is twofold: first, the encrypted connection protects the integrity and
confidentiality of the API exchange from other parties on the local
network; second, it provides the client of the API an opportunity to
authenticate the server that is hosting the API. This authentication
allows the client to ensure that the entity providing the Captive Portal
API has a valid certificate for the hostname provisioned by the network
using the mechanisms defined in \[[RFC8910](#RFC8910){.xref}\], by
validating that a DNS-ID \[[RFC6125](#RFC6125){.xref}\] on the
certificate is equal to the provisioned
hostname.[¶](#section-4.1-1){.pilcrow}

Clients performing revocation checking will need some means of accessing
revocation information for certificates presented by the API server.
Online Certificate Status Protocol \[[RFC6960](#RFC6960){.xref}\] (OCSP)
stapling, using the TLS Certificate Status Request extension
\[[RFC6066](#RFC6066){.xref}\], [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be used. OCSP stapling
allows a client to perform revocation checks without initiating new
connections. To allow for other forms of revocation checking, especially
for clients that do not support OCSP stapling, a captive network
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} permit connections to OCSP responders or Certificate
Revocation Lists (CRLs) that are referenced by certificates provided by
the API server. For more discussion on certificate revocation checks,
see [Section
6.5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7525#section-6.5){.relref} of BCP
195 \[[RFC7525](#RFC7525){.xref}\]. In addition to connections to OCSP
responders and CRLs, a captive network [SHOULD]{.bcp14} also permit
connections to Network Time Protocol (NTP)
\[[RFC5905](#RFC5905){.xref}\] servers or other time-sync mechanisms to
allow clients to accurately validate
certificates.[¶](#section-4.1-2){.pilcrow}

Certificates with missing intermediate certificates that rely on clients
validating the certificate chain using the URI specified in the
Authority Information Access (AIA) extension
\[[RFC5280](#RFC5280){.xref}\] [SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} be used by the
Captive Portal API server. If the certificates do require the use of
AIA, the captive network [MUST]{.bcp14} allow client access to the host
specified in the URI.[¶](#section-4.1-3){.pilcrow}

If the client is unable to validate the certificate presented by the API
server, it [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} proceed with any of the behavior for API
interaction described in this document. The client will proceed to
interact with the captive network as if the API capabilities were not
present. It may still be possible for the user to access the network if
the network redirects a cleartext webpage to a web
portal.[¶](#section-4.1-4){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-5 .section}
## [5.](#section-5){.section-number .selfRef} [API State Structure](#name-api-state-structure){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-api-state-structure}

The Captive Portal API data structures are specified in JavaScript
Object Notation (JSON) \[[RFC8259](#RFC8259){.xref}\]. Requests and
responses for the Captive Portal API use the
\"application/captive+json\" media type. Clients [SHOULD]{.bcp14}
include this media type as an Accept header in their GET requests, and
servers [MUST]{.bcp14} mark this media type as their Content-Type header
in responses.[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

The following key [MUST]{.bcp14} be included in the top level of the
JSON structure returned by the API server:[¶](#section-5-2){.pilcrow}

::: {#tab1}
  Key       Type      Description
  --------- --------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  captive   boolean   Indicates whether the client is in a state of captivity, i.e, it has not satisfied the conditions to access the external network. If the client is captive (i.e., captive=true), it will still be allowed enough access for it to perform server authentication ([Section 4.1](#server-auth){.xref}).

  : [Table 1](#table-1){.selfRef}
:::

The following keys can be optionally included in the top level of the
JSON structure returned by the API server:[¶](#section-5-4){.pilcrow}

::: {#tab2}
  Key                  Type      Description
  -------------------- --------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  user-portal-url      string    Provides the URL of a web portal that [MUST]{.bcp14} be accessed over TLS with which a user can interact.
  venue-info-url       string    Provides the URL of a webpage or site that [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be accessed over TLS on which the operator of the network has information that it wishes to share with the user (e.g., store info, maps, flight status, or entertainment).
  can-extend-session   boolean   Indicates that the URL specified as \"user-portal-url\" allows the user to extend a session once the client is no longer in a state of captivity. This provides a hint that a client system can suggest accessing the portal URL to the user when the session is near its limit in terms of time or bytes.
  seconds-remaining    number    An integer that indicates the number of seconds remaining, after which the client will be placed into a captive state. The API server [SHOULD]{.bcp14} include this value if the client is not captive (i.e., captive=false) and the client session is time-limited and [SHOULD]{.bcp14} omit this value for captive clients (i.e., captive=true) or when the session is not time-limited.
  bytes-remaining      number    An integer that indicates the number of bytes remaining, after which the client will be placed into a captive state. The byte count represents the sum of the total number of IP packet (layer 3) bytes sent and received by the client, including IP headers. Captive Portal systems might not count traffic to whitelisted servers, such as the API server, but clients cannot rely on such behavior. The API server [SHOULD]{.bcp14} include this value if the client is not captive (i.e., captive=false) and the client session is byte-limited and [SHOULD]{.bcp14} omit this value for captive clients (i.e., captive=true) or when the session is not byte-limited.

  : [Table 2](#table-2){.selfRef}
:::

The valid JSON keys can be extended by adding entries to the Captive
Portal API Keys Registry ([Section 8.2](#iana-field-reg){.xref}). If a
client receives a key that it does not recognize, it [MUST]{.bcp14}
ignore the key and any associated values. All keys other than the ones
defined in this document as \"required\" will be considered
optional.[¶](#section-5-6){.pilcrow}

Captive Portal JSON content can contain per-client data that is not
appropriate to store in an intermediary cache. Captive Portal API
servers [SHOULD]{.bcp14} set the Cache-Control header field in any
responses to \"private\" or a more restrictive value, such as
\"no-store\" \[[RFC7234](#RFC7234){.xref}\].[¶](#section-5-7){.pilcrow}

Client behavior for issuing requests for updated JSON content is
implementation specific and can be based on user interaction or the
indications of seconds and bytes remaining in a given session. If at any
point the client does not receive valid JSON content from the API
server, either due to an error or due to receiving no response, the
client [SHOULD]{.bcp14} continue to apply the most recent valid content
it had received or, if no content had been received previously, proceed
to interact with the captive network as if the API capabilities were not
present.[¶](#section-5-8){.pilcrow}

:::

::: {#example}
::: {#section-6 .section}
## [6.](#section-6){.section-number .selfRef} [Example Interaction](#name-example-interaction){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-example-interaction}

Upon discovering the URI of the API server, a client connected to a
captive network will query the API server to retrieve information about
its captive state and conditions to escape captivity. In this example,
the client discovered the URI
\"https://example.org/captive-portal/api/X54PD39JV\" using one of the
mechanisms defined in
\[[RFC8910](#RFC8910){.xref}\].[¶](#section-6-1){.pilcrow}

To request the Captive Portal JSON content, a client sends an HTTP GET
request:[¶](#section-6-2){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-6-3}
``` {.sourcecode .lang-http-message}
GET /captive-portal/api/X54PD39JV HTTP/1.1
Host: example.org
Accept: application/captive+json
```

[¶](#section-6-3){.pilcrow}
:::

The server then responds with the JSON content for that
client:[¶](#section-6-4){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-6-5}
``` {.sourcecode .lang-http-message}
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Cache-Control: private
Date: Mon, 02 Mar 2020 05:07:35 GMT
Content-Type: application/captive+json

{
   "captive": true,
   "user-portal-url": "https://example.org/portal.html"
}
```

[¶](#section-6-5){.pilcrow}
:::

Upon receiving this information, the client will use it to direct the
user to the web portal (as specified by the user-portal-url value) to
enable access to the external network. Once the user satisfies the
requirements for external network access, the client [SHOULD]{.bcp14}
query the API server again to verify that it is no longer
captive.[¶](#section-6-6){.pilcrow}

When the client requests the Captive Portal JSON content after gaining
external network access, the server responds with updated JSON
content:[¶](#section-6-7){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-6-8}
``` {.sourcecode .lang-http-message}

## [7.](#section-7){.section-number .selfRef} [Security Considerations](#name-security-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-security-considerations}

One of the goals of this protocol is to improve the security of the
communication between client hosts and Captive Portal systems. Client
traffic is protected from passive listeners on the local network by
requiring TLS-encrypted connections between the client and the Captive
Portal API server, as described in [Section 4](#api-details){.xref}. All
communication between the clients and the API server [MUST]{.bcp14} be
encrypted.[¶](#section-7-1){.pilcrow}

In addition to encrypting communications between clients and Captive
Portal systems, this protocol requires a basic level of authentication
from the API server, as described in [Section 4.1](#server-auth){.xref}.
Specifically, the API server [MUST]{.bcp14} present a valid certificate
on which the client can perform revocation checks. This allows the
client to ensure that the API server has authority for the hostname that
was provisioned by the network using \[[RFC8910](#RFC8910){.xref}\].
Note that this validation only confirms that the API server matches what
the network\'s provisioning mechanism (such as DHCP or IPv6 Router
Advertisements) provided; it is not validating the security of those
provisioning mechanisms or the user\'s trust relationship to the
network.[¶](#section-7-2){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-7.1 .section}
### [7.1.](#section-7.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Privacy Considerations](#name-privacy-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-privacy-considerations}

Information passed between a client and the user-facing web portal may
include a user\'s personal information, such as a full name and credit
card details. Therefore, it is important that both the user-facing web
portal and the API server that points a client to the web portal are
only accessed over encrypted connections.[¶](#section-7.1-1){.pilcrow}

It is important to note that although communication to the user-facing
web portal requires use of TLS, the authentication only validates that
the web portal server matches the name in the URI provided by the API
server. Since this is not a name that a user typed in, the hostname of
the website that would be presented to the user may include \"confusable
characters\", which can mislead the user. See [Section
12.5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8264#section-12.5){.relref} of
\[[RFC8264](#RFC8264){.xref}\] for a discussion of confusable
characters.[¶](#section-7.1-2){.pilcrow}

### [8.2.](#section-8.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Captive Portal API Keys Registry](#name-captive-portal-api-keys-reg){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-captive-portal-api-keys-reg}

IANA has created a new registry called \"Captive Portal API Keys\",
which reserves JSON keys for use in Captive Portal API data structures.
The initial contents of this registry are provided in [Section
5](#json-keys){.xref}.[¶](#section-8.2-1){.pilcrow}

Each entry in the registry contains the following
fields:[¶](#section-8.2-2){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

Key:
:   The JSON key being registered in string
    format.[¶](#section-8.2-3.2){.pilcrow}
:   

Type:
:   The type of the JSON value to be stored, as one of the value types
    defined in
    \[[RFC8259](#RFC8259){.xref}\].[¶](#section-8.2-3.4){.pilcrow}
:   

Description:
:   A brief description explaining the meaning of the value, how it
    might be used, and/or how it should be interpreted by
    clients.[¶](#section-8.2-3.6){.pilcrow}
:   

Reference:
:   A reference to a specification that defines the key and explains its
    usage.[¶](#section-8.2-3.8){.pilcrow}
:   

New assignments for the \"Captive Portal API Keys\" registry will be
administered by IANA using the Specification Required policy
\[[RFC8126](#RFC8126){.xref}\]. The designated expert is expected to
validate the existence of documentation describing new keys in a
permanent, publicly available specification, such as an Internet-Draft
or RFC. The expert is expected to validate that new keys have a clear
meaning and do not create unnecessary confusion or overlap with existing
keys. Keys that are specific to nongeneric use cases, particularly ones
that are not specified as part of an IETF document, are encouraged to
use a domain-specific prefix.[¶](#section-8.2-4){.pilcrow}
