# RFC 8711 {#rfcnum}

# Structure of the IETF Administrative Support Activity, Version 2.0 {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

The IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA) was originally
established in 2005. In the years since then, the needs of the IETF
evolved in ways that required changes to its administrative structure.
The purpose of this RFC is to document and describe the IETF
Administrative Support Activity, version 2.0 (IASA 2.0). It defines the
roles and responsibilities of the IETF Administration LLC Board (IETF
LLC Board), the IETF Executive Director, and the Internet Society in the
fiscal and administrative support of the IETF standards process. It also
defines the membership and selection rules for the IETF LLC
Board.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

This document obsoletes RFC 4071, RFC 4333, and RFC
7691.[¶](#section-abstract-2){.pilcrow}

The IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA) was originally
established in 2005. In the years since then, the needs of the IETF
evolved in ways that required changes to its administrative structure.
The purpose of this document is to document and describe the IASA 2.0
structure.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

Under IASA 2.0, the work of the IETF\'s administrative and fundraising
tasks is conducted by an administrative organization, the IETF
Administration LLC (IETF LLC). Under this structure, the IETF
Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) is eliminated, and its
oversight and advising functions transferred to the IETF LLC
Board.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

The IETF LLC provides the corporate legal home for the IETF, the
Internet Architecture Board (IAB), and the Internet Research Task Force
(IRTF), and financial support for the operation of the RFC
Editor.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

\[[IASA2RECS](#I-D.haberman-iasa20dt-recs){.xref}\] discusses the
challenges facing the original IASA structure as well as several options
for reorganizing the IETF\'s administration under different legal
structures. This document outlines how the chosen option is structured
and describes how the organization fits together with existing and new
IETF community structures.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

Under IASA 2.0, most of the responsibilities that
\[[RFC4071](#RFC4071){.xref}\] assigned to the IETF Administrative
Director (IAD) and the Internet Society (ISOC) were transferred to the
IETF LLC and IETF Administration LLC Executive Director (IETF Executive
Director). It is the job of the IETF LLC to meet the administrative
needs of the IETF and to ensure that the IETF LLC meets the needs of the
IETF community.[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}

Eliminating the IAOC meant that changes were required in how trustees
could be appointed to the IETF Trust. The details of how this is done
are outside the scope of this document but are covered in
\[[RFC8714](#RFC8714){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-6){.pilcrow}

This document obsoletes \[[RFC4071](#RFC4071){.xref}\], which specified
the original IASA, \[[RFC4333](#RFC4333){.xref}\], which specified the
selection guidelines and process for IAOC members, and
\[[RFC7691](#RFC7691){.xref}\], which specified terms for IAOC
members.[¶](#section-1-7){.pilcrow}

The document does not propose any changes related to the standards
process as currently conducted by the Internet Engineering Steering
Group (IESG) and Internet Architecture Board (IAB) (see BCP 9
\[[RFC2026](#RFC2026){.xref}\] and BCP 39
\[[RFC2850](#RFC2850){.xref}\]). In addition, no changes are made to the
appeals chain, the process for making and confirming IETF and IAB
appointments (see BCP 10 \[[RFC8713](#RFC8713){.xref}\]), the technical
work of the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) (see
\[[RFC2014](#RFC2014){.xref}\]), or to ISOC\'s membership in or support
of other organizations.[¶](#section-2-1){.pilcrow}

The LLC Agreement between the IETF LLC and ISOC is available at
\[[IETF-LLC-A](#IETF-LLC-A){.xref}\]. This IASA 2.0 structure, and thus
this document, depends on the LLC Agreement and will refer to it to help
explain certain aspects of the legal relationship between the IETF LLC
and ISOC.[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

The LLC Agreement was developed between legal representatives of the
IETF and ISOC and includes all critical terms of the relationship, while
still enabling maximum unilateral flexibility for the IETF LLC Board.
The LLC Agreement includes only basic details about how the Board
manages itself or manages IETF LLC staff, so that the Board has
flexibility to make changes without amending the agreement. The Board
can independently develop policy or procedures documents that fill
gaps.[¶](#section-3-2){.pilcrow}

The IETF LLC is established to provide administrative support to the
IETF. It has no authority over the standards development activities of
the IETF.[¶](#section-4.3-1){.pilcrow}

The responsibilities of the IETF LLC are:[¶](#section-4.3-2){.pilcrow}

-   [Operations. The IETF LLC is responsible for supporting the ongoing
    operations of the IETF, including meetings and non-meeting
    activities.[¶](#section-4.3-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.3-3.1}
-   [Finances. The IETF LLC is responsible for managing the IETF\'s
    finances and
    budget.[¶](#section-4.3-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.3-3.2}
-   [Fundraising. The IETF LLC is responsible for raising money on
    behalf of the
    IETF.[¶](#section-4.3-3.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.3-3.3}
-   [Compliance. The IETF LLC is responsible for establishing and
    enforcing policies to ensure compliance with applicable laws,
    regulations, and
    rules.[¶](#section-4.3-3.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.3-3.4}

The manner by which these responsibilities under the IETF LLC are
organized is intended to address the problems described in Sections
[3.1.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-haberman-iasa20dt-recs-03#section-3.1.1){.relref},
[3.1.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-haberman-iasa20dt-recs-03#section-3.1.2){.relref},
and
[3.1.3](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-haberman-iasa20dt-recs-03#section-3.1.3){.relref}
of \[[IASA2RECS](#I-D.haberman-iasa20dt-recs){.xref}\]. Specifically,
this is intended to bring greater clarity around roles,
responsibilities, representation, decision-making, and
authority.[¶](#section-4.3-4){.pilcrow}

In addition, by having the IETF LLC manage the IETF\'s finances and
conduct the IETF\'s fundraising, confusion about who is responsible for
representing the IETF to sponsors and who directs the uses of
sponsorship funds should be eliminated. Finally, having the IETF LLC
reside in a defined, distinct legal entity, and taking responsibility
for operations, enables the organization to execute its own contracts
without the need for review and approval by
ISOC.[¶](#section-4.3-5){.pilcrow}

The IETF LLC is expected to conduct its work according to the following
principles:[¶](#section-4.4-1){.pilcrow}

-   [Transparency. The IETF LLC is expected to keep the IETF community
    informed about its work, subject to reasonable confidentiality
    concerns, and to engage with the community to obtain consensus-based
    community input on key issues and otherwise as needed. The IETF
    community expects complete visibility into the financial and legal
    structure of the IETF LLC. This includes information about the IETF
    LLC annual budget and associated regular financial reports, results
    of financial and any other independent audits, tax filings,
    significant contracts, or other significant long-term financial
    commitments that bind the IETF LLC. Whatever doesn\'t have a
    specific justification for being kept confidential is expected to be
    made public. The Board is expected to develop and maintain a public
    list of confidential items, describing the nature of the information
    and the reason for confidentiality. The Board will also publish its
    operating
    procedures.[¶](#section-4.4-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.4-2.1}
-   [Responsiveness to the community. The IETF LLC is expected to act
    consistently with the documented consensus of the IETF community, to
    be responsive to the community\'s needs, and to adapt its decisions
    in response to consensus-based community
    feedback.[¶](#section-4.4-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.4-2.2}
-   [Diligence. The IETF LLC is expected to act responsibly so as to
    minimize risks to IETF participants and to the future of the IETF as
    a whole, such as financial
    risks.[¶](#section-4.4-2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.4-2.3}
-   [Unification: The IETF LLC provides the corporate legal home for the
    IETF, the Internet Architecture Board (IAB), and the Internet
    Research Task Force (IRTF), and financial support for the operation
    of the RFC Editor.[¶](#section-4.4-2.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.4-2.4}
-   [Transfer or Dissolution: Consistent with
    \[[IETF-LLC-A](#IETF-LLC-A){.xref}\], the IETF LLC subsidiary may be
    transferred from ISOC to another organization, at the request of
    either party. Similarly, the IETF LLC may be dissolved if necessary.
    Should either event occur, the IETF community should be closely
    involved in any decisions and plans. Any transfer, transition, or
    dissolution should be conducted carefully and with minimal potential
    disruption to the
    IETF.[¶](#section-4.4-2.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.4-2.5}

The transparency and responsiveness principles are designed to address
the concern outlined in [Section
3.3](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-haberman-iasa20dt-recs-03#section-3.3){.relref}
of \[[IASA2RECS](#I-D.haberman-iasa20dt-recs){.xref}\] about the need
for improved timeliness of sharing of information and decisions and
seeking community comments. The issue of increased transparency was
important throughout the IASA 2.0 process, with little to no dissent. It
was recognized that there will naturally be confidentiality requirements
about some aspects of contracting, personnel matters, and other narrow
areas.[¶](#section-4.4-3){.pilcrow}

The principles of the relationship between the IETF and ISOC are
outlined in \[[RFC8712](#RFC8712){.xref}\]. In short, the IETF is

The IETF LLC Board is directly accountable to the IETF community for the
performance of the IASA 2.0. However, the nature of the Board\'s work
involves treating the IESG, IRTF, and IAB as major internal customers of
the administrative support services. The Board and the IETF Executive
Director should not consider their work successful unless the IESG,
IRTF, and IAB are also satisfied with the administrative support that
the IETF is receiving.[¶](#section-4.6-1){.pilcrow}

The IETF LLC Board is directly accountable to the IETF community for the
performance of the IASA 2.0, including hiring and managing the IETF
Executive Director. In extreme cases of dissatisfaction with the IETF
LLC, the IETF community can utilize the recall process as noted in
[Section 6.7](#director-removal){.xref}.[¶](#section-4.7-1){.pilcrow}

Anyone in the community of IETF participants may ask the Board for a
formal review of a decision or action by the IETF Executive Director or
Board if they believe this was not undertaken in accordance with IETF
BCPs or IETF LLC Board policies and
procedures.[¶](#section-4.7-2){.pilcrow}

A formal request for review must be addressed to the IETF LLC Board
chair and must include a description of the decision or action to be
reviewed, an explanation of how, in the requestor\'s opinion, the
decision or action violates the BCPs or IASA 2.0 operational guidelines,
and a suggestion for how the situation could be
rectified.[¶](#section-4.7-3){.pilcrow}

The IETF LLC shall respond to such requests within a reasonable period,
typically within 90 days, and shall publicly publish information about
the request and the corresponding response and/or

### [5.1.](#section-5.1){.section-number .selfRef} [IETF Executive Director and Staff Responsibilities](#name-ietf-executive-director-and){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-ietf-executive-director-and}

The IETF LLC is led by an IETF Executive Director chosen by the Board.
The IETF Executive Director is responsible for managing the day-to-day
operations of the IETF LLC, including hiring staff to perform various
operational functions. The IETF Executive Director and any staff may be
employees or independent contractors.[¶](#section-5.1-1){.pilcrow}

Allowing for the division of responsibilities among multiple staff
members and contractors is designed to address some of the concerns
raised in Section
[3.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-haberman-iasa20dt-recs-03#section-3.2){.relref}
(Lack of Resources) and Section
[3.4](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-haberman-iasa20dt-recs-03#section-3.4){.relref}
(Funding/Operating Model Mismatch and Rising Costs) of
\[[IASA2RECS](#I-D.haberman-iasa20dt-recs){.xref}\].[¶](#section-5.1-2){.pilcrow}

Based on the amount of work previously undertaken by the IAD and others
involved in the IETF administration, the design of the IETF LLC
anticipated that the IETF Executive Director may need to hire multiple
additional staff members. For example, resources to manage fundraising,
to manage the various contractors that are engaged to fulfill the
IETF\'s administrative needs, and to support outreach and communications
were envisioned.[¶](#section-5.1-3){.pilcrow}

The IETF has historically benefited from the use of contractors for
accounting, finance, meeting planning, administrative assistance, legal
counsel, tools, and web site support, as well as other services related
to the standards process (e.g., RFC Editor and IANA). Prior to making
the transition from IASA to IASA 2.0, the IETF budget reflected specific
support from ISOC for communications and fundraising as well as some
general support for accounting, finance, legal, and other services. The
division of responsibilities between staff and contractors is at the
discretion of the IETF Executive Director and their
staff.[¶](#section-5.1-4){.pilcrow}

The IETF has a long history of community involvement in the execution of
certain administrative functions, in particular development of IETF
tools, the operation of the meeting network by the Network Operations
Center (NOC), and some outreach and communications activities conducted
by the Education and Mentoring Directorate. The IETF LLC staff is
expected to respect the IETF community\'s wishes about community
involvement in these and other functions going forward as long as the
staff feels that they can meet the otherwise-stated needs of the
community. Establishing the framework to allow the IETF LLC to staff
each administrative function as appropriate may require the IETF
community to document its consensus expectations in areas where no
documentation currently exists.[¶](#section-5.1-5){.pilcrow}

In summary, the IETF Executive Director, with support from the team that
they alone direct and lead, is responsible
for:[¶](#section-5.1-6){.pilcrow}

-   [Developing and refining an annual budget and other strategic
    financial planning documents at the direction of the
    Board.[¶](#section-5.1-7.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.1-7.1}
-   [Executing on the annual budget, including reporting to the Board
    regularly with forecasts and actual performance to
    budget.[¶](#section-5.1-7.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.1-7.2}
-   [Hiring and/or contracting the necessary resources to meet their
    goals, within the defined limits of the IETF Executive Director\'s
    authority and within the approved budget. This includes managing and
    leading any such resources, including performing regular performance
    reviews.[¶](#section-5.1-7.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.1-7.3}
-   [Following the pre-approval guidelines set forth by the Board for
    contracts or other decisions that have financial costs that exceed a
    certain threshold of significance. Such thresholds are expected to
    be set reasonably high so that the need for such approvals is
    infrequent and only occurs when something is truly significant or
    otherwise exceptional. It is expected that the IETF Executive
    Director is sufficiently empowered to perform the job on a
    day-to-day basis, being held accountable for meeting high-level
    goals rather than being
    micromanaged.[¶](#section-5.1-7.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.1-7.4}

This section is intended to provide a summary of key IETF LLC Board
responsibilities, but the precise and legally binding responsibilities
are defined in the LLC Agreement \[[IETF-LLC-A](#IETF-LLC-A){.xref}\]
and applicable law. If there are unintentional differences or other
confusion, the LLC Agreement and applicable law are
authoritative.[¶](#section-5.2-1){.pilcrow}

Board members have fiduciary obligations imposed by the LLC Agreement
and applicable law, including duties of loyalty, care, and good faith.
The Board is responsible for setting broad strategic direction for the
LLC, adopting an annual budget, hiring or terminating an IETF Executive
Director (or amending the terms of their engagement), adopting any
employee benefit plans, consulting the relevant IETF communities on
matters related to the LLC as appropriate, approving any changes to the
LLC governance structure, incurring any debt, and approving entering
into agreements that meet a significant materiality threshold to be
determined by the Board. The IETF LLC Board is expected to delegate
management of day-to-day activities and related decision-making to
staff.[¶](#section-5.2-2){.pilcrow}

Per Section 5(d) of the LLC Agreement and as also described in [Section
4.4](#principles){.xref} of this document, the Board shall, as
appropriate, act transparently and provide the IETF community with an
opportunity to review and discuss any proposed changes to the IETF LLC
structure prior to their adoption.[¶](#section-5.2-3){.pilcrow}

The role of the Board is to ensure that the strategy and conduct of the
IETF LLC is consistent with the IETF\'s needs \-- both its concrete
needs and its needs for transparency and accountability. The Board is
not intended to directly define the IETF\'s needs; to the extent that is
required, the IETF community should document its needs in
consensus-based RFCs (e.g., as the community did in
\[[RFC8718](#RFC8718){.xref}\]) and provide more detailed input via
consultations with the Board (such as takes place on email discussion
lists or at IETF meetings).[¶](#section-5.2-4){.pilcrow}

### [5.3.](#section-5.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Board Design Goals](#name-board-design-goals){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-board-design-goals}

A goal of this Board composition is to balance the need for the IETF LLC
to be accountable to the IETF community with the need for this Board to
have the expertise necessary to oversee a small non-profit company. The
Board is smaller than the previous IAOC and the other leadership bodies
of the IETF, in part to keep the Board focused on its rather limited set
of strategic responsibilities as noted in [Section
5.2](#board-responsibilities){.xref}.[¶](#section-5.3-1){.pilcrow}

This board structure, with limited strategic responsibilities noted in
[Section 5.2](#board-responsibilities){.xref} and limited size, together
with the staff responsibilities noted in [Section
5.1](#staff-responsibilities){.xref}, is designed to overcome the
challenges described in [Section
3.1.4](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-haberman-iasa20dt-recs-03#section-3.1.4){.relref}
of \[[IASA2RECS](#I-D.haberman-iasa20dt-recs){.xref}\] concerning
oversight. This establishes a clear line of oversight over staff
performance: the IETF LLC Board oversees the IETF Executive Director\'s
performance and has actual legal authority to remove a non-performing
IETF Executive Director. The IETF Executive Director is responsible for
the day-to-day operation of the IETF LLC.[¶](#section-5.3-2){.pilcrow}

Finally, the Board is expected to operate transparently, to further
address the concern raised in [Section
3.3](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-haberman-iasa20dt-recs-03#section-3.3){.relref}
of \[[IASA2RECS](#I-D.haberman-iasa20dt-recs){.xref}\]. The default
transparency rule arrived at during the IASA 2.0 design process is
detailed in [Section 4.4](#principles){.xref}. The Board will need to
establish how it will meet that commitment.[¶](#section-5.3-3){.pilcrow}

### [6.1.](#section-6.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Board Composition](#name-board-composition){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-board-composition}

There is a minimum of 5 directors, which is expandable to 6 or 7. The
IETF LLC Board is comprised of the
following:[¶](#section-6.1-1){.pilcrow}

-   [1 IETF Chair or delegate selected by the
    IESG[¶](#section-6.1-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.1-2.1}
-   [1 Appointed by the ISOC Board of
    Trustees[¶](#section-6.1-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.1-2.2}
-   [3 Selected by the IETF Nominating Committee (NomCom), confirmed by
    the IESG[¶](#section-6.1-2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.1-2.3}
-   [Up to 2 Appointed by the IETF LLC Board itself, on an as-needed
    basis, confirmed by the
    IESG[¶](#section-6.1-2.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.1-2.4}

For the first slot listed above, the presumption is that the IETF Chair
will serve on the board. At the IESG\'s discretion, another area
director may serve instead, or exceptionally the IESG may run a
selection process to appoint a director. The goal of having this slot on
the board is to maintain coordination and communication between the
board and the IESG.[¶](#section-6.1-3){.pilcrow}

### [6.2.](#section-6.2){.section-number .selfRef} [IETF LLC-Appointed Directors](#name-ietf-llc-appointed-director){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-ietf-llc-appointed-director}

As noted above, a maximum of two Directors may be appointed by the IETF
LLC Board. They can obviously choose to appoint none, one, or two. These
appointments need not be on an exceptional basis; they can be routine,
and may occur at any time of the year since it is on an as-needed
basis.[¶](#section-6.2-1){.pilcrow}

The appointment of a Board-appointed Director requires a two-thirds
majority vote of the Directors then in office, and the appointee shall
take office immediately upon appointment and IESG confirmation. The term
of each appointment is designated by the Board, with the maximum term
being three years, or until their earlier resignation, removal, or
death. The Board may decide on a case-by-case basis how long each term
shall be, factoring in the restriction for consecutive terms in [Section
6.5](#term-limit){.xref}.[¶](#section-6.2-2){.pilcrow}

The Board itself is expected to take an active role in recruiting
potential new Directors, regardless of the process that may be used to
appoint them. In particular, the NomCom is primarily focused on
considering requirements expressed by the Board and others, reviewing
community feedback on candidates, conducting candidate interviews, and
ultimately appointing Directors. The Board and others can recruit
potential Directors and get them into the consideration process of the
NomCom or into open consideration processes of the other appointing
bodies if those bodies choose to use such
processes.[¶](#section-6.3-1){.pilcrow}

The term length for a Director is three years. The exceptions to this
guideline are:[¶](#section-6.4-1){.pilcrow}

-   [The terms for some Directors during the first full formation of the
    IETF LLC Board in order to establish staggered terms and for any
    appointments to fill a

-   [The Director slot occupied by the IETF Chair ex officio or a

    applies regardless of whether the appointed individual is on the
    IESG, rotates off the IESG during the two-year term, or is not on
    the IESG. This makes the term length for this slot the same as the
    term lengths established in \[[RFC8713](#RFC8713){.xref}\], [Section
    3.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8713#section-3.4){.relref}.[¶](#section-6.4-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.4-2.2}

### [6.5.](#section-6.5){.section-number .selfRef} [IETF LLC Board Director Limit](#name-ietf-llc-board-director-lim){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-ietf-llc-board-director-lim}

A director may serve no more than two consecutive terms. A director
cannot serve a third term until three years have passed since their
second consecutive term. An exception is if a Director role is occupied
by the IETF Chair ex officio, since that person\'s service is governed
instead by the term lengths established in
\[[RFC8713](#RFC8713){.xref}\], [Section
3.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8713#section-3.4){.relref}.[¶](#section-6.5-1){.pilcrow}

The term limits specified above apply to an individual, even if that
individual is appointed in different ways over time. For example, an
individual appointed to two terms by the ISOC Board of Trustees may not
immediately be appointed to a third term by the IETF NomCom. A Director
appointed by the IETF LLC itself may only serve for one term by that
appointment method, and any subsequent terms would have to be via other
methods; in any case, the term limits above apply to that
individual.[¶](#section-6.5-2){.pilcrow}

Lastly, partial terms of less than three years for the initial
appointments to the first full Board, for which some Directors will have
terms of one or two years, do not count against the term
limit.[¶](#section-6.5-3){.pilcrow}

The limit on consecutive terms supports the healthy regular introduction
of new ideas and energy into the Board and mitigates potential long-term
risk of ossification or conflict, without adversely impacting the
potential pool of director candidates over
time.[¶](#section-6.5-4){.pilcrow}

NomCom-appointed and IESG-appointed Directors may be removed with or
without cause. A vote in favor of removal must be no fewer than the

Meeting revenues are another important source of funding that supports
the IETF, coming mainly from the fees paid by IETF meeting participants.
The IETF Executive Director sets those meeting fees, in consultation

participants at future meetings is a key part of the annual budget

Sponsorships and donations are an essential component of the financial
support for the IETF. Within the general bounds noted in [Section
7.8](#fundraising-practices){.xref}, the IETF LLC is responsible for
fundraising activities in order to establish, maintain, and grow a
strong foundation of donation revenues. This can and does include both
direct financial contributions as well as in-kind contributions, such as
equipment, software licenses, and services.[¶](#section-7.6-1){.pilcrow}

Sponsorships and donations to the IETF LLC do not (and must not) convey
to sponsors and donors any special oversight or direct influence over
the IETF\'s technical work or other activities of the IETF or IETF LLC.
This helps ensure that no undue influence may be ascribed to those from
whom funds are raised, and so helps to maintain an open and
consensus-based IETF standards process.[¶](#section-7.6-2){.pilcrow}

To the extent that the IETF LLC needs to undertake any significant
special projects for the IETF, the IETF LLC may need to fundraise
distinctly for those special projects. As a result, the IETF LLC may
conduct fundraising to support the IETF in general as well as one or
more special fundraising efforts (which may also be accounted for
distinctly and be held in a separate bank account or investment, as
needed).[¶](#section-7.6-3){.pilcrow}

IETF LLC\'s funding and all revenues, in-kind contributions, and other

States tax law, the IETF LLC must send a written acknowledgment of
contributions to donors. The IETF LLC evaluates and facilitates state,
federal, and other applicable law and regulatory compliance for ISOC
and/or the LLC with respect to such fundraising activities. In addition,
the IETF LLC ensures that all fundraising activities are conducted in

fund, as noted in the \[[IETF-LLC-A](#IETF-LLC-A){.xref}\] or as
otherwise necessary.[¶](#section-7.9-1){.pilcrow}

As noted in [Section 4.3](#llc-responsibilities){.xref}, the IETF LLC is
responsible for managing the IETF\'s finances and budget. A key part of
this responsibility is establishing, maintaining, and successfully
meeting an annual budget. This is essential to the continued operation
and vibrancy of the IETF\'s technical activities and establishes trust
with ISOC, sponsors, and donors that funds are being appropriately
spent, and that financial oversight is being conducted properly. This is
also essential to the IETF LLC meeting applicable legal and tax
requirements and is a core part of the Board\'s fiduciary
responsibilities.[¶](#section-7.10-1){.pilcrow}

As explained in [Section 5.1](#staff-responsibilities){.xref}, the IETF
