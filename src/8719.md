## [1.](#section-1){.section-number .selfRef} [Introduction](#name-introduction){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-introduction}

The work of the IETF is primarily conducted on working group (WG)
mailing lists, while face-to-face WG meetings mainly provide a
high-bandwidth mechanism for working out unresolved issues. The IETF
currently strives to have a 1-1-1 meeting policy where the goal is to
distribute the meetings equally between North America, Europe, and Asia
(see \"Meeting Location Distribution\" (slides 14 and 15) of
\[[IETFMEET](#IETFMEET){.xref}\] for details). These are the locations
from which most of the IETF participants have come in the recent past.
This meeting rotation is mainly aimed at distributing the travel effort
for the existing IETF participants who physically attend meetings and
for distributing the timezone difficulty for those who participate
remotely. This policy has been neither defined precisely nor documented
in an IETF consensus document until now. This BCP RFC is meant to serve
as a consensus-backed statement of this
policy.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}
:::

::: {#section-2 .section}
## [2.](#section-2){.section-number .selfRef} [The 1-1-1-\* Meeting Policy](#name-the-1-1-1-meeting-policy){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-the-1-1-1-meeting-policy}

Given that the majority of the current meeting participants come from
North America, Europe, and Asia \[[CONT-DIST](#CONT-DIST){.xref}\], the
IETF policy is that the meetings should primarily be held in those
regions. That is, the meeting policy (let\'s call this the \"1-1-1\"
policy) is that meetings should rotate between North America, Europe,
and Asia. Note that the boundaries between those regions have been
purposefully left undefined. It is important to note that such rotation
and any effects to distributing travel pain should be considered from a
long-term perspective. While a potential cycle in an IETF year may be a
meeting in North America in March, a meeting in Europe in July, and a
meeting in Asia on November, the 1-1-1 policy does not imply such a
cycle, as long as the distribution to these regions over multiple years
is roughly equal. There are many reasons why meetings might be
distributed differently in a given year. Meeting locations in subsequent
years should seek to rebalance the distribution, if
possible.[¶](#section-2-1){.pilcrow}

While this meeting rotation caters to the current set of IETF
participants, it is important to recognize that due to the dynamic and
evolving nature of participation, there may be significant changes to
the regions that provide a major share of participants in the future.
Therefore, the 1-1-1-\* meeting policy is a slightly modified version of
the aforementioned 1-1-1 meeting policy that allows for additional
flexibility in the form of an exploratory meeting (denoted with an
\"\*\"). Exploratory meetings can be used to experiment with exceptional
meetings without extensively impacting the regular meetings. For
example, these exploratory meetings can include meetings in other
geographical regions, virtual meetings, and additional meetings beyond
the three regular meetings in a calendar
year.[¶](#section-2-2){.pilcrow}

The timing and frequency of future exploratory meetings will be based on
IETF consensus as determined by the IETF chair. Once a meeting proposal
is initiated, the IESG will make a decision in consultation with the
IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA)
\[[RFC8711](#RFC8711){.xref}\] to ensure that the proposal can be
realistically implemented. The final decision will be communicated back
to the community to ensure that there is adequate opportunity to
comment.[¶](#section-2-3){.pilcrow}

NOTE: There have not been a large number of meetings that would qualify
as exploratory meetings under the 1-1-1 policy (with IETF 95 in Buenos
Aires and IETF 47 in Adelaide being the exceptional instances). IETF 27
(Amsterdam) and IETF 54 (Yokohama) were earlier examples of exploratory
meetings that pioneered Europe and Asia as regular IETF
destinations.[¶](#section-2-4.1){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-3 .section}
## [3.](#section-3){.section-number .selfRef} [Implementation of the Policy](#name-implementation-of-the-polic){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-implementation-of-the-polic}

IASA should understand the policy written in this document to be the
aspiration of the IETF community. Similarly, any exploratory meeting
decisions will also be communicated to the IASA to be implemented. The
actual selection of the venue would be performed by the IASA following
the process described in
\[[RFC8718](#RFC8718){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

As mentioned in \[[RFC8718](#RFC8718){.xref}\], the IASA will also be
responsible for the following:[¶](#section-3-2){.pilcrow}

-   [assisting the community in the development of detailed meeting
    criteria that are feasible and implementable,
    and[¶](#section-3-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-3.1}
-   [providing sufficient transparency in a timely manner concerning
    planned meetings so that community feedback can be collected and
    acted upon.[¶](#section-3-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-3.2}

Given that the geographical location of the venue has a significant
influence on the venue selection process, it needs to be considered at
the same level as the other Important Criteria specified in [Section
3.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8718#section-3.2){.relref} of
\[[RFC8718](#RFC8718){.xref}\] (including potentially trading-off the
geographical region to meet other criteria and notifying the community
if the geographical region requirement cannot be
met).[¶](#section-3-4){.pilcrow}

## [4.](#section-4){.section-number .selfRef} [Procedure for Initiating Proposals for Exploratory Meetings](#name-procedure-for-initiating-pr){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-procedure-for-initiating-pr}

Someone who is interested in pursuing an exploratory venue proposes it
on the IETF discussion list or on a future discussion list expressly set
up and announced for this purpose. The community gets to comment on the
venue and offer their opinions. If the IETF chair determines that there
is community consensus to pursue the venue further, the venue will be
put up for discussion on the venue-selection mailing list
\<<https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/venue-selection>\>. This would
allow the interested party(ies) to refine their proposal based on
insightful feedback regarding the logistics of the venue from those
tasked with evaluating it. Once the venue selection process takes place,
the final decision will be communicated back to the community to ensure
that there is adequate opportunity to
comment.[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

## [5.](#section-5){.section-number .selfRef} [Re-evaluation and Changes to This Policy](#name-re-evaluation-and-changes-t){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-re-evaluation-and-changes-t}

Given the dynamic nature of participant distribution in the IETF, it is
expected that this policy will need to be periodically evaluated and
revised to ensure that the stated goals continue to be met. The criteria
that are to be met need to be agreed upon by the community prior to
initiating a revision of this document (e.g., try to mirror draft author
distribution over the preceding five years).[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}
