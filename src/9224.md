Querying and retrieving registration data from registries are defined in
the Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP)
\[[RFC7480](#RFC7480){.xref}\] \[[RFC7481](#RFC7481){.xref}\]
\[[RFC9082](#RFC9082){.xref}\] \[[RFC9083](#RFC9083){.xref}\]. These
documents do not specify where to send the queries. This document
specifies a method to find which server is authoritative to answer
queries for the requested scope.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

Top-Level Domains (TLDs), Autonomous System (AS) numbers, and network
blocks are delegated by IANA to Internet registries such as TLD
registries and Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) that then issue
further delegations and maintain information about them. Thus, the
bootstrap information needed by RDAP clients is best generated from data
and processes already maintained by IANA; the relevant registries
already exist at \[[ipv4reg](#ipv4reg){.xref}\],
\[[ipv6reg](#ipv6reg){.xref}\], \[[asreg](#asreg){.xref}\], and
\[[domainreg](#domainreg){.xref}\]. This document obsoletes
\[[RFC7484](#RFC7484){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

Per this document, IANA has created new registries based on a JSON
format specified in this document, herein named RDAP Bootstrap Service
Registries. These new registries are based on the existing entries of
the above-mentioned registries. An RDAP client fetches the RDAP
Bootstrap Service Registries, extracts the data, and then performs a
match with the query data to find the authoritative registration data
server and appropriate query base URL.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

The RDAP Bootstrap Service Registries, as specified in [Section
12](#ianaconsiderations){.xref} below, have been made available as JSON
\[[RFC8259](#RFC8259){.xref}\] objects, which can be retrieved via HTTP
from locations specified by IANA. The JSON object for each registry
contains a series of members containing metadata about the registry such
as a version identifier, a timestamp of the publication date of the
registry, and a description. Additionally, a \"services\" member
contains the registry items themselves, as an array. Each item of the
array contains a second-level array, with two elements, each of them
being a third-level array.[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

Each element of the Services Array is a second-level array with two
elements: in order, an Entry Array and a Service URL
Array.[¶](#section-3-2){.pilcrow}

The Entry Array contains all entries that have the same set of base RDAP
URLs. The Service URL Array contains the list of base RDAP URLs usable
for the entries found in the Entry Array. Elements within these two
arrays are not ordered in any way.[¶](#section-3-3){.pilcrow}

An example structure of the JSON output of an RDAP Bootstrap Service
Registry is illustrated:[¶](#section-3-4){.pilcrow}

The formal syntax is described in [Section
10](#abnf){.xref}.[¶](#section-3-6){.pilcrow}

The \"version\" corresponds to the format version of the registry. This
specification defines version \"1.0\".[¶](#section-3-7){.pilcrow}

The syntax of the \"publication\" value conforms to the Internet
date/time format \[[RFC3339](#RFC3339){.xref}\]. The value is the latest
update date of the registry by IANA.[¶](#section-3-8){.pilcrow}

The optional \"description\" string can contain a comment regarding the
content of the bootstrap object.[¶](#section-3-9){.pilcrow}

Per \[[RFC7258](#RFC7258){.xref}\], in each array of base RDAP URLs, the
secure versions of the transport protocol [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be preferred
and tried first. For example, if the base RDAP URLs array contains both
HTTPS and HTTP URLs, the bootstrap client [SHOULD]{.bcp14} try the HTTPS
version first.[¶](#section-3-10){.pilcrow}

Base RDAP URLs [MUST]{.bcp14} have a trailing \"/\" character because
they are concatenated to the various segments defined in
\[[RFC9082](#RFC9082){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3-11){.pilcrow}

JSON names [MUST]{.bcp14} follow the format recommendations of [Section
6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7480#section-6){.relref} of
\[[RFC7480](#RFC7480){.xref}\]. Any unrecognized JSON object properties
or values [MUST]{.bcp14} be ignored by
implementations.[¶](#section-3-12){.pilcrow}

Internationalized Domain Name labels used as entries or base RDAP URLs
in the registries defined in this document [MUST]{.bcp14} be only
represented using their A-label form as defined in
\[[RFC5890](#RFC5890){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3-13){.pilcrow}

All Domain Name labels used as entries or base RDAP URLs in the

[¶](#section-4-2){.pilcrow}
:::

The domain name\'s authoritative registration data service is found by
doing the label-wise longest match of the target domain name with the
domain values in the Entry Arrays in the IANA \"Bootstrap Service
Registry for Domain Name Space\". The match is done per label, from
right to left. If the longest match results in multiple entries, then
those entries are considered equivalent. The values contained in the
Service URL Array of the matching second-level array are the valid base
RDAP URLs as described in
\[[RFC9082](#RFC9082){.xref}\].[¶](#section-4-3){.pilcrow}

For example, a domain RDAP query for a.b.example.com matches the com
entry in one of the arrays of the registry. The base RDAP URL for this
query is then taken from the second element of the array, which is an
array of base RDAP URLs valid for this entry. The client chooses one of
the base URLs from this array; in this example, it chooses the only one
available, \"https://registry.example.com/myrdap/\". The segment
specified in \[[RFC9082](#RFC9082){.xref}\] is then appended to the base
URL to complete the query. The complete query is then
\"https://registry.example.com/myrdap/domain/a.b.example.com\".[¶](#section-4-4){.pilcrow}

If a domain RDAP query for a.b.example.com matches both com and
example.com entries in the registry, then the longest match applies and
the example.com entry is used by the client.[¶](#section-4-5){.pilcrow}

If the registry contains entries such as com and goodexample.com, then a
domain RDAP query for example.com only matches the com entry because
matching is done on a per-label basis.[¶](#section-4-6){.pilcrow}

The entry for the root of the domain name space is specified as
\"\".[¶](#section-4-7){.pilcrow}

This section discusses IPv4 and IPv6 address space and Autonomous System
numbers.[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

For IP address space, the authoritative registration data service is
found by doing a longest match of the target address with the values of
the arrays in the corresponding RDAP Bootstrap Service Registry for
Address Space. The longest match is done the same way as in packet
forwarding: the addresses are converted in binary form and then the
binary strings are compared to find the longest match up to the
specified prefix length. The values contained in the second element of
the array are the base RDAP URLs as described in
\[[RFC9082](#RFC9082){.xref}\]. The longest match method enables
covering prefixes of a larger address space pointing to one base RDAP
URL while more specific prefixes within the covering prefix are being
served by another base RDAP URL.[¶](#section-5-2){.pilcrow}

latter is chosen by the client because it is the longest match. The base
RDAP URL for this query is then taken from the second element of the
array, which is an array of base RDAP URLs valid for this entry. The
client chooses one of the base URLs from this array; in this example, it
chooses the only one available, \"https://example.org/\". The {resource}

For example, a query for \"2001:db8:1000::/48\" matches the
\"2001:db8::/34\" entry and the \"2001:db8:1000::/36\" entry in the
example registry above. The latter is chosen by the client because it is
the longest match. The base RDAP URL for this query is then taken from
the second element of the array, which is an array of base RDAP URLs
valid for this entry. The client chooses one of the base URLs from this
array; in this example, it chooses \"https://example.net/rdaprir2/\"
because it\'s the secure version of the protocol. The segment specified
in \[[RFC9082](#RFC9082){.xref}\] is then appended to the base URL to
complete the query. The complete query is therefore
\"https://example.net/rdaprir2/ip/2001:db8:1000::/48\". If the target
RDAP server does not answer, the client can then use another URL prefix
from the array.[¶](#section-5.2-3){.pilcrow}

For example, a query for AS 65411 matches the 64512-65534 entry in the
example registry above. The base RDAP URL for this query is then taken
from the second element of the array, which is an array of base RDAP
URLs valid for this entry. The client chooses one of the base URLs from
this array; in this example, it chooses
\"https://example.net/rdaprir2/\". The segment specified in
\[[RFC9082](#RFC9082){.xref}\] is then appended to the base URL to
complete the query. The complete query is, therefore,
\"https://example.net/rdaprir2/autnum/65411\". If the server does not
answer, the client can then use another URL prefix from the
array.[¶](#section-5.3-3){.pilcrow}

Entities (such as contacts, registrants, or registrars) can be queried
by handle as described in \[[RFC9082](#RFC9082){.xref}\]. Since there is
no global name space for entities, this document does not describe how
to find the authoritative RDAP server for entities. However, it is
possible that, if the entity identifier was received from a previous
query, the same RDAP server could be queried for that entity, or the
entity identifier itself is a fully qualified URL that can be queried.

## [8.](#section-8){.section-number .selfRef} [Deployment and Implementation Considerations](#name-deployment-and-implementati){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-deployment-and-implementati}

This method relies on the fact that RDAP clients are fetching the IANA
registries to then find the servers locally. Clients [SHOULD
NOT]{.bcp14} fetch the registry on every RDAP request. Clients
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} cache the registry, but use underlying protocol
signaling, such as the HTTP Expires header field
\[[RFC7234](#RFC7234){.xref}\], to identify when it is time to refresh
the cached registry.[¶](#section-8-1){.pilcrow}

Some authorities of registration data may work together on sharing their
information for a common service, including mutual redirection
\[[REDIRECT-RDAP](#I-D.ietf-weirds-redirects){.xref}\].[¶](#section-8-2){.pilcrow}

When a new object is allocated, such as a new AS range, a new TLD, or a
new IP address range, there is no guarantee that this new object will
have an entry in the corresponding bootstrap RDAP registry, since the
setup of the RDAP server for this new entry may become live and
registered later. Therefore, the clients should expect that even if an
object, such as TLD, IP address range, or AS range is allocated, the
existence of the entry in the corresponding bootstrap registry is not
guaranteed.[¶](#section-8-3){.pilcrow}

By providing a bootstrap method to find RDAP servers, this document
helps to ensure that the end users will get the RDAP data from an
authoritative source instead of from rogue sources. The method has the
same security properties as the RDAP protocols themselves. The transport
used to access the registries uses TLS
\[[RFC8446](#RFC8446){.xref}\].[¶](#section-11-1){.pilcrow}

Additional considerations on using RDAP are described in
\[[RFC7481](#RFC7481){.xref}\].[¶](#section-11-2){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-12 .section}
## [12.](#section-12){.section-number .selfRef} [IANA Considerations](#name-iana-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-iana-considerations}

IANA has created the RDAP Bootstrap Services Registries listed below and
made them available as JSON objects. The contents of these registries
are described in Sections [3](#struct){.xref},
[4](#domainrdapreg){.xref}, and [5](#iprdapreg){.xref}, with the formal
syntax specified in [Section 10](#abnf){.xref}. The registries
[MUST]{.bcp14} be accessible only through HTTPS (TLS
\[[RFC8446](#RFC8446){.xref}\]) transport.[¶](#section-12-1){.pilcrow}

The process for adding or updating entries in these registries differs
from the normal IANA registry processes: these registries are generated
from the data, processes, and policies maintained by IANA in their
allocation registries (\[[ipv4reg](#ipv4reg){.xref}\],
\[[ipv6reg](#ipv6reg){.xref}\], \[[asreg](#asreg){.xref}\], and
\[[domainreg](#domainreg){.xref}\]), with the addition of new RDAP
server information.[¶](#section-12-2){.pilcrow}

IANA updates RDAP Bootstrap Services Registries entries from the
allocation registries as those registries are
updated.[¶](#section-12-3){.pilcrow}

This document does not change any policies related to the allocation
registries; IANA has provided a mechanism for collecting the RDAP server
information.[¶](#section-12-4){.pilcrow}

IANA has created a new top-level category on the Protocol Registries
page: \<<https://www.iana.org/protocols>\>. The group is called
\"Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP)\". Each of the RDAP Bootstrap
Services Registries has been made available for on-demand download in
the JSON format by the general public, and that registry\'s URI is
listed directly on the Protocol Registries
page.[¶](#section-12-5){.pilcrow}

Other normal registries will be added to this group by other documents,
but the reason the URIs for these registries are clearly listed on the
main page is to make those URIs obvious to implementers \-- these are
registries that will be accessed by software, as well as by humans using
them for reference information.[¶](#section-12-6){.pilcrow}

Because these registries will be accessed by software, the download
demand for the RDAP Bootstrap Services Registries may be unusually high
compared to normal IANA registries. The technical infrastructure by
which registries are published has been put in place by IANA to support
the load. Since the publication of \[[RFC7484](#RFC7484){.xref}\], no
issues have been reported regarding the load or the
service.[¶](#section-12-7){.pilcrow}

As discussed in [Section 8](#deploy){.xref}, software that accesses
these registries will depend on the HTTP Expires header field to limit
their query rate. It is, therefore, important for that header field to
be properly set to provide timely information as the registries change,
while maintaining a reasonable load on the IANA
servers.[¶](#section-12-8){.pilcrow}

The HTTP Content-Type returned to clients accessing these JSON-formatted
registries [MUST]{.bcp14} be \"application/json\", as defined in
\[[RFC8259](#RFC8259){.xref}\].[¶](#section-12-9){.pilcrow}

Because of how information in the RDAP Bootstrap Services Registries is
grouped and formatted, the registry entries may not be sortable. It is,
therefore, not required or expected that the entries be ordered in any
way.[¶](#section-12-10){.pilcrow}
