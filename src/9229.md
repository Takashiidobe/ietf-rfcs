# IPv4 Routes with an IPv6 Next Hop in the Babel Routing Protocol {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

This document defines an extension to the Babel routing protocol that
allows announcing routes to an IPv4 prefix with an IPv6 next hop, which
makes it possible for IPv4 traffic to flow through interfaces that have
not been assigned an IPv4 address.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

## [1.](#section-1){.section-number .selfRef} [Introduction](#name-introduction){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-introduction}

The role of a routing protocol is to build a routing table, a data
structure that maps network prefixes in a given family (IPv4 or IPv6) to
next hops, which are (at least conceptually) pairs of an outgoing
interface and a neighbour\'s network address. For
example:[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-1-2 .alignLeft .art-text .artwork}
              destination                      next hop
          2001:db8:0:1::/64               eth0, fe80::1234:5678
          203.0.113.0/24                  eth0, 192.0.2.1

[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}
:::

When a packet is routed according to a given routing table entry, the
forwarding plane typically uses a neighbour discovery protocol (the
Neighbour Discovery (ND) protocol \[[RFC4861](#RFC4861){.xref}\] in the
case of IPv6 and the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
\[[RFC0826](#RFC0826){.xref}\] in the case of IPv4) to map the next-hop
address to a link-layer address (a \"Media Access Control (MAC)
address\"), which is then used to construct the link-layer frames that
encapsulate forwarded packets.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

It is apparent from the description above that there is no fundamental
reason why the destination prefix and the next-hop address should be in
the same address family: there is nothing preventing an IPv6 packet from
being routed through a next hop with an IPv4 address (in which case the
next hop\'s MAC address will be obtained using ARP) or, conversely, an
IPv4 packet from being routed through a next hop with an IPv6 address.
(In fact, it is even possible to store link-layer addresses directly in
the next-hop entry of the routing table, which is commonly done in
networks using the OSI protocol suite).[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

The case of routing IPv4 packets through an IPv6 next hop is
particularly interesting, since it makes it possible to build networks
that have no IPv4 addresses except at the edges and still provide IPv4
connectivity to edge hosts. In addition, since an IPv6 next hop can use
a link-local address that is autonomously configured, the use of such
routes enables a mode of operation where the network core has no
statically assigned IP addresses of either family, which significantly
reduces the amount of manual configuration required. (See also
\[[RFC7404](#RFC7404){.xref}\] for a discussion of the issues involved
with such an approach.)[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}

We call a route towards an IPv4 prefix that uses an IPv6 next hop a
\"v4-via-v6\" route. This document describes an extension that allows
the Babel routing protocol \[[RFC8966](#RFC8966){.xref}\] to announce
v4-via-v6 routes across interfaces that have no IPv4 addresses assigned
but are capable of forwarding IPv4 traffic. [Section 3](#icmp){.xref}
describes procedures that ensure that all routers can originate ICMPv4
packets, even if they have not been assigned any IPv4
addresses.[¶](#section-1-6){.pilcrow}

The extension described in this document is inspired by a previously
defined extension to BGP
\[[RFC5549](#RFC5549){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-7){.pilcrow}

## [2.](#section-2){.section-number .selfRef} [Protocol Operation](#name-protocol-operation){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-protocol-operation}

The Babel protocol fully supports dual-stack operation: all data that
represent a neighbour address or a network prefix are tagged by an
Address Encoding (AE), a small integer that identifies the address
family (IPv4 or IPv6) of the address of prefix and describes how it is
encoded. This extension defines a new AE, called \"v4-via-v6\", which
has the same format as the existing AE for IPv4 addresses (AE 1). This
new AE is only allowed in TLVs that carry network prefixes: TLVs that
carry an IPv6 neighbour address use one of the normal encodings for IPv6
addresses.[¶](#section-2-1){.pilcrow}

::: {#updates}

### [2.1.](#section-2.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Announcing v4-via-v6 Routes](#name-announcing-v4-via-v6-routes){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-announcing-v4-via-v6-routes}

A Babel node can use a v4-via-v6 announcement to announce an IPv4 route
over an interface that has no assigned IPv4 address. In order to do so,
it first establishes an IPv6 next-hop address in the usual manner
(either by sending the Babel packet over IPv6, or by including a Next
Hop TLV containing an IPv6 address and using AE 2 or 3); it then sends
an Update, with AE equal to 4 (v4-via-v6) containing the IPv4 prefix
being announced.[¶](#section-2.1-1){.pilcrow}

If the outgoing interface has been assigned an IPv4 address, then, in
the interest of maximising compatibility with existing routers, the
sender [SHOULD]{.bcp14} prefer an ordinary IPv4 announcement; even in
that case, however, it [MAY]{.bcp14} send a v4-via-v6 announcement. A
node [SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} send both ordinary IPv4 and v4-via-v6
announcements for the same prefix over a single interface (if the update
is sent to a multicast address) or to a single neighbour (if sent to a
unicast address), since doing that provides no benefit while doubling
the amount of routing traffic.[¶](#section-2.1-2){.pilcrow}

Updates with infinite metric are retractions: they indicate that a
previously announced route is no longer available. Retractions do not
require a next hop; therefore, there is no difference between v4-via-v6
retractions and ordinary retractions. A node [MAY]{.bcp14} send IPv4
retractions only, or it [MAY]{.bcp14} send v4-via-v6 retractions on
interfaces that have not been assigned an IPv4
address.[¶](#section-2.1-3){.pilcrow}

Upon reception of an Update TLV with AE equal to 4 (v4-via-v6) and
finite metric, a Babel node computes the IPv6 next hop, as described in
[Section
4.6.9](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8966#section-4.6.9){.relref} of
\[[RFC8966](#RFC8966){.xref}\]. If no IPv6 next hop exists, then the
Update [MUST]{.bcp14} be ignored. If an IPv6 next hop exists, then the
node [MAY]{.bcp14} acquire the route being announced, as described in
[Section
3.5.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8966#section-3.5.3){.relref} of
\[[RFC8966](#RFC8966){.xref}\]; the parameters of the route are as
follows:[¶](#section-2.2-1){.pilcrow}

-   [The prefix, plen, router-id, seqno, and metric [MUST]{.bcp14} be
    computed as for an IPv4 route, as described in [Section
    4.6.9](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8966#section-4.6.9){.relref}
    of
    \[[RFC8966](#RFC8966){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2.2-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.2-2.1}
-   [The next hop [MUST]{.bcp14} be computed as for an IPv6 route, as
    described in [Section
    4.6.9](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8966#section-4.6.9){.relref}
    of \[[RFC8966](#RFC8966){.xref}\]. It is taken from the last
    preceding Next Hop TLV with an AE field equal to 2 or 3; if no such
    entry exists and if the Update TLV has been sent in a Babel packet
    carried over IPv6, then the next hop is the network-layer source
    address of the
    packet.[¶](#section-2.2-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.2-2.2}

An Update TLV with a v4-via-v6 AE and metric equal to infinity is a
retraction: it announces that a previously available route is being
retracted. In that case, no next hop is necessary, and the retraction is
treated as described in [Section
4.6.9](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8966#section-4.6.9){.relref} of
\[[RFC8966](#RFC8966){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2.2-3){.pilcrow}

As usual, a node [MAY]{.bcp14} ignore the update, e.g., due to filtering
(see [Appendix
C](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8966#appendix-C){.relref} of
\[[RFC8966](#RFC8966){.xref}\]). If a node cannot install v4-via-v6
routes, e.g., due to hardware or software limitations, then routes to an
IPv4 prefix with an IPv6 next hop [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be
selected.[¶](#section-2.2-4){.pilcrow}

### [2.3.](#section-2.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Route and Seqno Requests](#name-route-and-seqno-requests){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-route-and-seqno-requests}

Route and seqno requests are used to request an update for a given
prefix. Since they are not related to a specific next hop, there is no
semantic difference between IPv4 and v4-via-v6 requests. Therefore, a
node [SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} send requests of either kind with the AE field
being set to 4 (v4-via-v6); instead, it [SHOULD]{.bcp14} request IPv4
updates by sending requests with the AE field being set to 1
(IPv4).[¶](#section-2.3-1){.pilcrow}

When receiving requests, AEs 1 (IPv4) and 4 (v4-via-v6) [MUST]{.bcp14}
be treated in the same manner: the receiver processes the request as
described in [Section
3.8](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8966#section-3.8){.relref} of
\[[RFC8966](#RFC8966){.xref}\]. If an Update is sent, then it
[MAY]{.bcp14} be an ordinary IPv4 announcement (AE = 1) or a v4-via-v6
announcement (AE = 4), as described in [Section 2.1](#updates){.xref},
irrespective of which AE was used in the
request.[¶](#section-2.3-2){.pilcrow}

When receiving a request with AE 0 (wildcard), the receiver
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} send a full route dump, as described in [Section
3.8.1.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8966#section-3.8.1.1){.relref}
of \[[RFC8966](#RFC8966){.xref}\]. Any IPv4 routes contained in the
route dump may use either AE 1 (IPv4) or AE 4 (v4-via-v6), as described
[Section 2.1](#updates){.xref}.[¶](#section-2.3-3){.pilcrow}

The only other TLVs defined by \[[RFC8966](#RFC8966){.xref}\] that carry
an AE field are Next Hop and IHU. Next Hop and IHU TLVs [MUST

## [3.](#section-3){.section-number .selfRef} [ICMPv4 and PMTU Discovery](#name-icmpv4-and-pmtu-discovery){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-icmpv4-and-pmtu-discovery}

The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMPv4, or simply ICMP)
\[[RFC0792](#RFC0792){.xref}\] is a protocol related to IPv4 that is
primarily used to carry diagnostic and debugging information. ICMPv4
packets may be originated by end hosts (e.g., the \"destination
unreachable, port unreachable\" ICMPv4 packet), but they may also be
originated by intermediate routers (e.g., most other kinds of
\"destination unreachable\" packets).[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

Some protocols deployed in the Internet rely on ICMPv4 packets sent by
intermediate routers. Most notably, Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD)
\[[RFC1191](#RFC1191){.xref}\] is an algorithm executed by end hosts to
discover the maximum packet size that a route is able to carry. While
there exist variants of PMTUD that are purely end-to-end
\[[RFC4821](#RFC4821){.xref}\], the variant most commonly deployed in
the Internet has a hard dependency on ICMPv4 packets originated by
intermediate routers: if intermediate routers are unable to send ICMPv4
packets, PMTUD may lead to persistent blackholing of IPv4
traffic.[¶](#section-3-2){.pilcrow}

Due to this kind of dependency, every Babel router that is able to
forward IPv4 traffic [MUST]{.bcp14} be able originate ICMPv4 traffic.
Since the extension described in this document enables routers to
forward IPv4 traffic received over an interface that has not been
assigned an IPv4 address, a router implementing this extension
[MUST]{.bcp14} be able to originate ICMPv4 packets even when the
outgoing interface has not been assigned an IPv4
address.[¶](#section-3-3){.pilcrow}

In such a situation, if a Babel router has an interface that has been
assigned an IPv4 address (other than a loopback address) or if an IPv4
address has been assigned to the router itself (to the \"loopback
interface\"), then that IPv4 address may be used as the source of
originated ICMPv4 packets. If no IPv4 address is available, a Babel
router could use the experimental mechanism described in Requirement
R-22 of [Section
4.8](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7600#section-4.8){.relref} of
\[[RFC7600](#RFC7600){.xref}\], which consists of using the dummy
address 192.0.0.8 as the source address of originated ICMPv4 packets.
Note, however, that using the same address on multiple routers may
hamper debugging and fault isolation, e.g., when using the
\"traceroute\" utility.[¶](#section-3-4){.pilcrow}

TLVs [MUST]{.bcp14} be constructed and decoded as described in [Section
4.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8966#section-4.6){.relref} of
\[[RFC8966](#RFC8966){.xref}\], and the network prefixes contained
within them [MUST]{.bcp14} be decoded as described in [Section

This protocol extension adds no new TLVs or
sub-TLVs.[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

This protocol extension uses a new AE. As discussed in [Appendix
D](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8966#appendix-D){.relref} of
\[[RFC8966](#RFC8966){.xref}\] and specified in the same document,
implementations that do not understand the present extension will
silently ignore the various TLVs that use this new AE. As a result,
incompatible versions will ignore v4-via-v6 routes. They will also
ignore requests with AE 4 (v4-via-v6), which, as stated in [Section
2.3](#requests){.xref}, are not recommended.[¶](#section-5-2){.pilcrow}

Using a new AE introduces a new compression state, which is used to
parse the network prefixes. As this compression state is separate from
the states of other AEs, it will not interfere with the compression
state of unextended nodes.[¶](#section-5-3){.pilcrow}

This extension reuses the next-hop state from AEs 2 and 3 (IPv6) but
makes no changes to the way in which it is updated. Therefore, it causes
no compatibility issues.[¶](#section-5-4){.pilcrow}

As mentioned in [Section 2.1](#updates){.xref}, ordinary IPv4
announcements are preferred to v4-via-v6 announcements when the outgoing
interface has an assigned IPv4 address; doing otherwise would prevent
routers that do not implement this extension from learning the route
being announced.[¶](#section-5-5){.pilcrow}

## [7.](#section-7){.section-number .selfRef} [Security Considerations](#name-security-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-security-considerations}

The extension defined in this document does not fundamentally change the
security properties of the Babel protocol. However, by allowing IPv4
routes to be propagated across routers that have not been assigned IPv4
addresses, it might invalidate the assumptions made by network
administrators, which could conceivably lead to security
issues.[¶](#section-7-1){.pilcrow}

For example, if an island of IPv4-only hosts is separated from the IPv4
Internet by routers that have not been assigned IPv4 addresses, a
network administrator might reasonably assume that the IPv4-only hosts
are unreachable from the IPv4 Internet. This assumption is broken if the
intermediary routers implement the extension described in this document,
which might expose the IPv4-only hosts to traffic from the IPv4
Internet. If this is undesirable, the flow of IPv4 traffic must be
restricted by the use of suitable filtering rules (see [Appendix
C](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8966#appendix-C){.relref} of
\[[RFC8966](#RFC8966){.xref}\]) together with matching packet filters in
the data plane.[¶](#section-7-2){.pilcrow}
