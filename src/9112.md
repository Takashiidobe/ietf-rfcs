The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a stateless application-level
request/response protocol that uses extensible semantics and
self-descriptive messages for flexible interaction with network-based
hypertext information systems. HTTP/1.1 is defined
by:[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

-   [\"HTTP Semantics\"

-   [\"HTTP Caching\"
    \[[CACHING](#CACHING){.xref}\][¶](#section-1-2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-2.3}

This document specifies how HTTP semantics are conveyed using the
HTTP/1.1 message syntax, framing, and connection management mechanisms.
Its goal is to define the complete set of requirements for HTTP/1.1
message parsers and message-forwarding
intermediaries.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

This document obsoletes the portions of [RFC 7230](#RFC7230){.xref}
related to HTTP/1.1 messaging and connection management, with the
changes being summarized in [Appendix
C.3](#changes.from.rfc.7230){.xref}. The other parts of [RFC
7230](#RFC7230){.xref} are obsoleted by \"HTTP Semantics\"
\[[HTTP](#HTTP){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

An HTTP/1.1 message consists of a start-line followed by a CRLF and a
sequence of octets in a format similar to the Internet Message Format
\[[RFC5322](#RFC5322){.xref}\]: zero or more header field lines
(collectively referred to as the \"headers\" or the \"header section\"),
an empty line indicating the end of the header section, and an optional
message body.[¶](#section-2.1-1){.pilcrow}

[¶](#section-2.1-2){.pilcrow}
:::

A message can be either a request from client to server or a response
from server to client. Syntactically, the two types of messages differ
only in the start-line, which is either a request-line (for requests) or
a status-line (for responses), and in the algorithm for determining the
length of the message body ([Section
6](#message.body){.xref}).[¶](#section-2.1-3){.pilcrow}

[¶](#section-2.1-4){.pilcrow}
:::

In theory, a client could receive requests and a server could receive
responses, distinguishing them by their different start-line formats. In
practice, servers are implemented to only expect a request (a response
is interpreted as an unknown or invalid request method), and clients are
implemented to only expect a response.[¶](#section-2.1-5){.pilcrow}

HTTP makes use of some protocol elements similar to the Multipurpose
Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) \[[RFC2045](#RFC2045){.xref}\]. See

::: {#section-2.2 .section}
### [2.2.](#section-2.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Message Parsing](#name-message-parsing){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-message-parsing}

The normal procedure for parsing an HTTP message is to read the
start-line into a structure, read each header field line into a hash
table by field name until the empty line, and then use the parsed data
to determine if a message body is expected. If a message body has been
indicated, then it is read as a stream until an amount of octets equal
to the message body length is read or the connection is
closed.[¶](#section-2.2-1){.pilcrow}

A recipient [MUST]{.bcp14} parse an HTTP message as a sequence of octets
in an encoding that is a superset of US-ASCII
\[[USASCII](#USASCII){.xref}\]. Parsing an HTTP message as a stream of
Unicode characters, without regard for the specific encoding, creates
security vulnerabilities due to the varying ways that string processing
libraries handle invalid multibyte character sequences that contain the
octet LF (%x0A). String-based parsers can only be safely used within
protocol elements after the element has been extracted from the message,
such as within a header field line value after message parsing has
delineated the individual field lines.[¶](#section-2.2-2){.pilcrow}

Although the line terminator for the start-line and fields is the
sequence CRLF, a recipient [MAY]{.bcp14} recognize a single LF as a line
terminator and ignore any preceding CR.[¶](#section-2.2-3){.pilcrow}

A sender [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} generate a bare CR (a CR character not
immediately followed by LF) within any protocol elements other than the
content. A recipient of such a bare CR [MUST]{.bcp14} consider that
element to be invalid or replace each bare CR with SP before processing
the element or forwarding the message.[¶](#section-2.2-4){.pilcrow}

Older HTTP/1.0 user agent implementations might send an extra CRLF after
a POST request as a workaround for some early server applications that
failed to read message body content that was not terminated by a
line-ending. An HTTP/1.1 user agent [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} preface or follow
a request with an extra CRLF. If terminating the request message body
with a line-ending is desired, then the user agent [MUST]{.bcp14} count
the terminating CRLF octets as part of the message body
length.[¶](#section-2.2-5){.pilcrow}

In the interest of robustness, a server that is expecting to receive and
parse a request-line [SHOULD]{.bcp14} ignore at least one empty line
(CRLF) received prior to the request-line.[¶](#section-2.2-6){.pilcrow}

A sender [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} send whitespace between the start-line and
the first header field.[¶](#section-2.2-7){.pilcrow}

A recipient that receives whitespace between the start-line and the
first header field [MUST]{.bcp14} either reject the message as invalid
or consume each whitespace-preceded line without further processing of
it (i.e., ignore the entire line, along with any subsequent lines
preceded by whitespace, until a properly formed header field is received
or the header section is terminated). Rejection or removal of invalid
whitespace-preceded lines is necessary to prevent their
misinterpretation by downstream recipients that might be vulnerable to
request smuggling ([Section 11.2](#request.smuggling){.xref}) or
response splitting ([Section 11.1](#response.splitting){.xref})
attacks.[¶](#section-2.2-8){.pilcrow}

When a server listening only for HTTP request messages, or processing
what appears from the start-line to be an HTTP request message, receives
a sequence of octets that does not match the HTTP-message grammar aside
from the robustness exceptions listed above, the server [SHOULD]{.bcp14}
respond with a 400 (Bad Request) response and close the
connection.[¶](#section-2.2-9){.pilcrow}

HTTP uses a \"\<major>.\<minor>\" numbering scheme to indicate versions
of the protocol. This specification defines version \"1.1\". [Section
2.5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-2.5){.relref} of
\[[HTTP](#HTTP){.xref}\] specifies the semantics of HTTP version
numbers.[¶](#section-2.3-1){.pilcrow}

The version of an HTTP/1.x message is indicated by an HTTP-version field
in the [start-line](#message.format){.xref}. HTTP-version is
case-sensitive.[¶](#section-2.3-2){.pilcrow}

[¶](#section-2.3-3){.pilcrow}
:::

When an HTTP/1.1 message is sent to an HTTP/1.0 recipient
\[[HTTP/1.0](#HTTP10){.xref}\] or a recipient whose version is unknown,
the HTTP/1.1 message is constructed such that it can be interpreted as a
valid HTTP/1.0 message if all of the newer features are ignored. This
specification places recipient-version requirements on some new features
so that a conformant sender will only use compatible features until it
has determined, through configuration or the receipt of a message, that
the recipient supports HTTP/1.1.[¶](#section-2.3-4){.pilcrow}

Intermediaries that process HTTP messages (i.e., all intermediaries
other than those acting as tunnels) [MUST]{.bcp14} send their own
HTTP-version in forwarded messages, unless it is purposefully downgraded
as a workaround for an upstream issue. In other words, an intermediary
is not allowed to blindly forward the
[start-line](#message.format){.xref} without ensuring that the protocol
version in that message matches a version to which that intermediary is
conformant for both the receiving and sending of messages. Forwarding an
HTTP message without rewriting the HTTP-version might result in
communication errors when downstream recipients use the message
sender\'s version to determine what features are safe to use for later
communication with that sender.[¶](#section-2.3-5){.pilcrow}

A server [MAY]{.bcp14} send an HTTP/1.0 response to an HTTP/1.1 request
if it is known or suspected that the client incorrectly implements the
HTTP specification and is incapable of correctly processing later
version responses, such as when a client fails to parse the version
number correctly or when an intermediary is known to blindly forward the
HTTP-version even when it doesn\'t conform to the given minor version of
the protocol. Such protocol downgrades [SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} be performed
unless triggered by specific client attributes, such as when one or more
of the request header fields (e.g., User-Agent) uniquely match the
values sent by a client known to be in
error.[¶](#section-2.3-6){.pilcrow}

Although the request-line grammar rule requires that each of the

[MAY]{.bcp14} instead parse on whitespace-delimited word boundaries and,
aside from the CRLF terminator, treat any form of whitespace as the SP
separator while ignoring preceding or trailing whitespace; such
whitespace includes one or more of the following octets: SP, HTAB, VT
(%x0B), FF (%x0C), or bare CR. However, lenient parsing can result in
request smuggling security vulnerabilities if there are multiple
recipients of the message and each has its own unique interpretation of
robustness (see [Section

The target URI is the [request-target](#request.target){.xref} when the
request-target is in [absolute-form](#absolute-form){.xref}. In that
case, a server will parse the URI into its generic components for
further evaluation.[¶](#section-3.3-1){.pilcrow}

context and various parts of the request message in order to identify
the target resource ([Section

-   [If the server\'s configuration provides for a fixed URI scheme, or
    a scheme is provided by a trusted outbound gateway, that scheme is
    used for the target URI. This is common in large-scale deployments
    because a gateway server will receive the client\'s connection
    context and replace that with their own connection to the inbound
    server. Otherwise, if the request is received over a secured
    connection, the target URI\'s scheme is \"https\"; if not, the
    scheme is
    \"http\".[¶](#section-3.3-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.3-3.1}
-   [If the request-target is in
    [authority-form](#authority-form){.xref}, the target URI\'s
    authority component is the request-target. Otherwise, the target
    URI\'s authority component is the field value of the Host header
    field. If there is no Host header field or if its field value is
    empty or invalid, the target URI\'s authority component is
    empty.[¶](#section-3.3-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.3-3.2}

If the target URI\'s authority component is empty and its URI scheme
requires a non-empty authority (as is the case for \"http\" and
\"https\"), the server can reject the request or determine whether a
configured default applies that is consistent with the incoming
connection\'s context. Context might include connection details like
address and port, what security has been applied, and locally defined
information specific to that server\'s configuration. An empty authority
is replaced with the configured default before further processing of the
request.[¶](#section-3.3-12){.pilcrow}

Supplying a default name for authority within the context of a secured
connection is inherently unsafe if there is any chance that the user
agent\'s intended authority might differ from the default. A server that
can uniquely identify an authority from the request context
[MAY]{.bcp14} use that identity as a default without this risk.
Alternatively, it might be better to redirect the request to a safe
resource that explains how to obtain a new
client.[¶](#section-3.3-13){.pilcrow}

Note that reconstructing the client\'s target URI is only half of the
process for identifying a target resource. The other half is determining
whether that target URI identifies a resource for which the server is
willing and able to send a response, as defined in [Section

Transfer-Encoding is analogous to the Content-Transfer-Encoding field of
MIME, which was designed to enable safe transport of binary data over a
7-bit transport service (\[[RFC2045](#RFC2045){.xref}\], [Section
6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2045#section-6){.relref}). However,
safe transport has a different focus for an 8bit-clean transfer
protocol. In HTTP\'s case, Transfer-Encoding is primarily intended to
accurately delimit dynamically generated content. It also serves to
distinguish encodings that are only applied in transit from the
encodings that are a characteristic of the selected
representation.[¶](#section-6.1-3){.pilcrow}

A recipient [MUST]{.bcp14} be able to parse the chunked transfer coding
([Section 7.1](#chunked.encoding){.xref}) because it plays a crucial
role in framing messages when the content size is not known in advance.
A sender [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} apply the chunked transfer coding more than
once to a message body (i.e., chunking an already chunked message is not
allowed). If any transfer coding other than chunked is applied to a
request\'s content, the sender [MUST]{.bcp14} apply chunked as the final
transfer coding to ensure that the message is properly framed. If any
transfer coding other than chunked is applied to a response\'s content,
the sender [MUST]{.bcp14} either apply chunked as the final transfer
coding or terminate the message by closing the
connection.[¶](#section-6.1-4){.pilcrow}

For example,[¶](#section-6.1-5){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-6.1-6}
``` {.lang-http-message .sourcecode}

indicates that the content has been compressed using the gzip coding and
then chunked using the chunked coding while forming the message
body.[¶](#section-6.1-7){.pilcrow}

Unlike Content-Encoding ([Section
8.4.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-8.4.1){.relref} of
\[[HTTP](#HTTP){.xref}\]), Transfer-Encoding is a property of the
message, not of the representation. Any recipient along the
request/response chain [MAY]{.bcp14} decode the received transfer
coding(s) or apply additional transfer coding(s) to the message body,
assuming that corresponding changes are made to the Transfer-Encoding
field value. Additional information about the encoding parameters can be
provided by other header fields not defined by this
specification.[¶](#section-6.1-8){.pilcrow}

Transfer-Encoding [MAY]{.bcp14} be sent in a response to a HEAD request
or in a 304 (Not Modified) response ([Section
15.4.5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-15.4.5){.relref}
of \[[HTTP](#HTTP){.xref}\]) to a GET request, neither of which includes
a message body, to indicate that the origin server would have applied a
transfer coding to the message body if the request had been an
unconditional GET. This indication is not required, however, because any
recipient on the response chain (including the origin server) can remove
transfer codings when they are not needed.[¶](#section-6.1-9){.pilcrow}

A server [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} send a Transfer-Encoding header field in any
response with a status code of 1xx (Informational) or 204 (No Content).
A server [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} send a Transfer-Encoding header field in any
2xx (Successful) response to a CONNECT request ([Section
9.3.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-9.3.6){.relref} of
\[[HTTP](#HTTP){.xref}\]).[¶](#section-6.1-10){.pilcrow}

A server that receives a request message with a transfer coding it does
not understand [SHOULD]{.bcp14} respond with 501 (Not
Implemented).[¶](#section-6.1-11){.pilcrow}

Transfer-Encoding was added in HTTP/1.1. It is generally assumed that
implementations advertising only HTTP/1.0 support will not understand
how to process transfer-encoded content, and that an HTTP/1.0 message
received with a Transfer-Encoding is likely to have been forwarded
without proper handling of the chunked transfer coding in
transit.[¶](#section-6.1-12){.pilcrow}

A client [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} send a request containing Transfer-Encoding
unless it knows the server will handle HTTP/1.1 requests (or later minor
revisions); such knowledge might be in the form of specific user
configuration or by remembering the version of a prior received
response. A server [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} send a response containing
Transfer-Encoding unless the corresponding request indicates HTTP/1.1
(or later minor revisions).[¶](#section-6.1-13){.pilcrow}

Early implementations of Transfer-Encoding would occasionally send both
a chunked transfer coding for message framing and an estimated
Content-Length header field for use by progress bars. This is why
Transfer-Encoding is defined as overriding Content-Length, as opposed to
them being mutually incompatible. Unfortunately, forwarding such a
message can lead to vulnerabilities regarding request smuggling
([Section 11.2](#request.smuggling){.xref}) or response splitting
([Section 11.1](#response.splitting){.xref}) attacks if any downstream
recipient fails to parse the message according to this specification,
particularly when a downstream recipient only implements
HTTP/1.0.[¶](#section-6.1-14){.pilcrow}

A server [MAY]{.bcp14} reject a request that contains both
Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding or process such a request in
accordance with the Transfer-Encoding alone. Regardless, the server
[MUST]{.bcp14} close the connection after responding to such a request
to avoid the potential attacks.[¶](#section-6.1-15){.pilcrow}

A server or client that receives an HTTP/1.0 message containing a
Transfer-Encoding header field [MUST]{.bcp14} treat the message as if
the framing is faulty, even if a Content-Length is present, and close
the connection after processing the message. The message sender might
have retained a portion of the message, in buffer, that could be
misinterpreted by further use of the

that sends a request containing a message body [SHOULD]{.bcp14} use a
valid [Content-Length](#body.content-length){.xref} header field if the
message body length is known in advance, rather than the chunked
transfer coding, since some existing services respond to chunked with a
411 (Length Required) status code even though they understand the
chunked transfer coding. This is typically because such services are
implemented via a gateway that requires a content length in advance of
being called, and the server is unable or unwilling to buffer the entire
request before processing.[¶](#section-6.3-6){.pilcrow}

A user agent that sends a request that contains a message body
[MUST]{.bcp14} send either a valid
[Content-Length](#body.content-length){.xref} header field or use the
chunked transfer coding. A client [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} use the chunked

configuration or by remembering the version of a prior received
response.[¶](#section-6.3-7){.pilcrow}

the case if the prior message\'s Content-Length value is incorrect. A

The chunk-size field is a string of hex digits indicating the size of

A recipient [MUST]{.bcp14} be able to parse and decode the chunked
transfer coding.[¶](#section-7.1-4){.pilcrow}

HTTP/1.1 does not define any means to limit the size of a chunked
response such that an intermediary can be assured of buffering the
entire response. Additionally, very large chunk sizes may cause
overflows or loss of precision if their values are not represented
accurately in a receiving implementation. Therefore, recipients
[MUST]{.bcp14} anticipate potentially large hexadecimal numerals and
prevent parsing errors due to integer conversion overflows or precision
loss due to integer representation.[¶](#section-7.1-5){.pilcrow}

The chunked coding is specific to each connection and is likely to be

HTTP messaging is independent of the underlying transport- or
session-layer connection protocol(s). HTTP only presumes a reliable
transport with in-order delivery of requests and the corresponding

structures onto the data units of an underlying transport protocol is

\[[HTTP](#HTTP){.xref}\], the specific connection protocols to be used
for an HTTP interaction are determined by client configuration and the
target URI. For example, the \"http\" URI scheme ([Section
4.2.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-4.2.1){.relref} of

with a default TCP port of 80, but the client might be configured to use
a proxy via some other connection, port, or
protocol.[¶](#section-9-2){.pilcrow}

HTTP implementations are expected to engage in connection management,
which includes maintaining the state of current connections,
establishing a new connection or reusing an existing connection,
processing messages received on a connection, detecting connection
failures, and closing each connection. Most clients maintain multiple
connections in parallel, including more than one connection per server
endpoint. Most servers are designed to maintain thousands of concurrent
connections, while controlling request queues to enable fair use and

HTTP/1.1 does not include a request identifier for associating a given
request message with its corresponding one or more response messages.
Hence, it relies on the order of response arrival to correspond exactly
to the order in which requests are made on the same connection. More
than one response message per request only occurs when one or more
informational responses (1xx; see [Section
15.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-15.2){.relref} of
\[[HTTP](#HTTP){.xref}\]) precede a final response to the same
request.[¶](#section-9.2-1){.pilcrow}

A client that has more than one outstanding request on a connection
[MUST]{.bcp14} maintain a list of outstanding requests in the order sent
and [MUST]{.bcp14} associate each received response message on that
connection to the first outstanding request that has not yet received a
final (non-1xx) response.[¶](#section-9.2-2){.pilcrow}

If a client receives data on a connection that doesn\'t have outstanding
requests, the client [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} consider that data to be a valid
response; the client [SHOULD]{.bcp14} close the connection, since
message delimitation is now ambiguous, unless the data consists only of
one or more CRLF (which can be discarded per [Section
2.2](#message.parsing){.xref}).[¶](#section-9.2-3){.pilcrow}

HTTP/1.1 defaults to the use of \"persistent connections\", allowing
multiple requests and responses to be carried over a single connection.
HTTP implementations [SHOULD]{.bcp14} support persistent
connections.[¶](#section-9.3-1){.pilcrow}

A recipient determines whether a connection is persistent or not based
on the protocol version and Connection header field ([Section

A client that does not support [persistent
connections](#persistent.connections){.xref} [MUST]{.bcp14} send the
\"[close](#persistent.tear-down){.xref}\" connection option in every
request message.[¶](#section-9.3-4){.pilcrow}

A server that does not support [persistent
connections](#persistent.connections){.xref} [MUST]{.bcp14} send the
\"[close](#persistent.tear-down){.xref}\" connection option in every
response message that does not have a 1xx (Informational) status
code.[¶](#section-9.3-5){.pilcrow}

A client [MAY]{.bcp14} send additional requests on a persistent
connection until it sends or receives a
\"[close](#persistent.tear-down){.xref}\" connection option or receives
an HTTP/1.0 response without a \"keep-alive\" connection
option.[¶](#section-9.3-6){.pilcrow}

In order to remain persistent, all messages on a connection need to have
a self-defined message length (i.e., one not defined by closure of the
connection), as described in [Section 6](#message.body){.xref}. A server
[MUST]{.bcp14} read the entire request message body or close the
connection after sending its response; otherwise, the remaining data on
a persistent connection would be misinterpreted as the next request.
Likewise, a client [MUST]{.bcp14} read the entire response message body
if it intends to reuse the same connection for a subsequent
request.[¶](#section-9.3-7){.pilcrow}

A proxy server [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} maintain a persistent connection with
an HTTP/1.0 client (see [Appendix
C.2.2](#compatibility.with.http.1.0.persistent.connections){.xref} for
information and discussion of the problems with the Keep-Alive header
field implemented by many HTTP/1.0

Connections can be closed at any time, with or without intention.
Implementations ought to anticipate the need to recover from
asynchronous close events. The conditions under which a client can
automatically retry a sequence of outstanding requests are defined in
[Section
9.2.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-9.2.2){.relref} of

A client that supports persistent connections [MAY]{.bcp14} \"pipeline\"
its requests (i.e., send multiple requests without waiting for each
response). A server [MAY]{.bcp14} process a sequence of pipelined
requests in parallel if they all have safe methods ([Section
9.2.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-9.2.1){.relref} of
\[[HTTP](#HTTP){.xref}\]), but it [MUST]{.bcp14} send the corresponding
responses in the same order that the requests were
received.[¶](#section-9.3.2-1){.pilcrow}

A client that pipelines requests [SHOULD]{.bcp14} retry unanswered
requests if the connection closes before it receives all of the
corresponding responses. When retrying pipelined requests after a failed
connection (a connection not explicitly closed by the server in its last
complete response), a client [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} pipeline immediately
after connection establishment, since the first remaining request in the
prior pipeline might have caused an error response that can be lost
again if multiple requests are sent on a prematurely closed connection
(see the TCP reset problem described in [Section
9.6](#persistent.tear-down){.xref}).[¶](#section-9.3.2-2){.pilcrow}

Idempotent methods ([Section
9.2.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-9.2.2){.relref} of
\[[HTTP](#HTTP){.xref}\]) are significant to pipelining because they can
be automatically retried after a connection failure. A user agent
[SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} pipeline requests after a non-idempotent method,
until the final response status code for that method has been received,
unless the user agent has a means to detect and recover from partial
failure conditions involving the pipelined
sequence.[¶](#section-9.3.2-3){.pilcrow}

An intermediary that receives pipelined requests [MAY]{.bcp14} pipeline
those requests when forwarding them inbound, since it can rely on the
outbound user agent(s) to determine what requests can be safely
pipelined. If the inbound connection fails before receiving a response,
the pipelining intermediary [MAY]{.bcp14} attempt to retry a sequence of
requests that have yet to receive a response if the requests all have
idempotent methods; otherwise, the pipelining intermediary
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} forward any received responses and then close the
corresponding outbound connection(s) so that the outbound user agent(s)
can recover accordingly.[¶](#section-9.3.2-4){.pilcrow}

### [9.4.](#section-9.4){.section-number .selfRef} [Concurrency](#name-concurrency){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-concurrency}

A client ought to limit the number of simultaneous open connections that
it maintains to a given server.[¶](#section-9.4-1){.pilcrow}

Previous revisions of HTTP gave a specific number of connections as a
ceiling, but this was found to be impractical for many applications. As
a result, this specification does not mandate a particular maximum
number of connections but, instead, encourages clients to be
conservative when opening multiple
connections.[¶](#section-9.4-2){.pilcrow}

Multiple connections are typically used to avoid the \"head-of-line
blocking\" problem, wherein a request that takes significant server-side
processing and/or transfers very large content would block subsequent
requests on the same connection. However, each connection consumes
server resources.[¶](#section-9.4-3){.pilcrow}

Furthermore, using multiple connections can cause undesirable side
effects in congested networks. Using larger numbers of connections can
also cause side effects in otherwise uncongested networks, because their
aggregate and initially synchronized sending behavior can cause
congestion that would not have been present if fewer parallel
connections had been used.[¶](#section-9.4-4){.pilcrow}

Note that a server might reject traffic that it deems abusive or
characteristic of a denial-of-service attack, such as an excessive
number of open connections from a single
client.[¶](#section-9.4-5){.pilcrow}

### [9.5.](#section-9.5){.section-number .selfRef} [Failures and Timeouts](#name-failures-and-timeouts){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-failures-and-timeouts}

Servers will usually have some timeout value beyond which they will no
longer maintain an inactive connection. Proxy servers might make this a
higher value since it is likely that the client will be making more
connections through the same proxy server. The use of persistent
connections places no requirements on the length (or existence) of this
timeout for either the client or the
server.[¶](#section-9.5-1){.pilcrow}

A client or server that wishes to time out [SHOULD]{.bcp14} issue a
graceful close on the connection. Implementations [SHOULD]{.bcp14}
constantly monitor open connections for a received closure signal and
respond to it as appropriate, since prompt closure of both sides of a
connection enables allocated system resources to be
reclaimed.[¶](#section-9.5-2){.pilcrow}

A client, server, or proxy [MAY]{.bcp14} close the transport connection
at any time. For example, a client might have started to send a new
request at the same time that the server has decided to close the
\"idle\" connection. From the server\'s point of view, the connection is
being closed while it was idle, but from the client\'s point of view, a
request is in progress.[¶](#section-9.5-3){.pilcrow}

A server [SHOULD]{.bcp14} sustain persistent connections, when possible,
and allow the underlying transport\'s flow-control mechanisms to resolve
temporary overloads rather than terminate connections with the
expectation that clients will retry. The latter technique can exacerbate
network congestion or server load.[¶](#section-9.5-4){.pilcrow}

A client sending a message body [SHOULD]{.bcp14} monitor the network
connection for an error response while it is transmitting the request.
If the client sees a response that indicates the server does not wish to
receive the message body and is closing the connection, the client
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} immediately cease transmitting the body and close its
side of the connection.[¶](#section-9.5-5){.pilcrow}

The \"close\" connection option is defined as a signal that the sender
will close this connection after completion of the response. A sender
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} send a Connection header field ([Section
7.6.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-7.6.1){.relref} of

::: {#field.close}

A client that sends a \"close\" connection option [MUST NOT]{.bcp14}
send further requests on that connection (after the one containing the
\"close\") and [MUST]{.bcp14} close the connection after reading the
final response message corresponding to this
request.[¶](#section-9.6-5){.pilcrow}

A server that receives a \"close\" connection option [MUST]{.bcp14}
initiate closure of the connection (see below) after it sends the final
response to the request that contained the \"close\" connection option.
The server [SHOULD]{.bcp14} send a \"close\" connection option in its
final response on that connection. The server [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} process
any further requests received on that
connection.[¶](#section-9.6-6){.pilcrow}

A server that sends a \"close\" connection option [MUST]{.bcp14}
initiate closure of the connection (see below) after it sends the
response containing the \"close\" connection option. The server [MUST
NOT]{.bcp14} process any further requests received on that
connection.[¶](#section-9.6-7){.pilcrow}

A client that receives a \"close\" connection option [MUST]{.bcp14}
cease sending requests on that connection and close the connection after
reading the response message containing the \"close\" connection option;
if additional pipelined requests had been sent on the connection, the
client [SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} assume that they will be processed by the
server.[¶](#section-9.6-8){.pilcrow}

If a server performs an immediate close of a TCP connection, there is a
significant risk that the client will not be able to read the last HTTP
response. If the server receives additional data from the client on a
fully closed connection, such as another request sent by the client
before receiving the server\'s response, the server\'s TCP stack will
send a reset packet to the client; unfortunately, the reset packet might
erase the client\'s unacknowledged input buffers before they can be read
and interpreted by the client\'s HTTP
parser.[¶](#section-9.6-9){.pilcrow}

To avoid the TCP reset problem, servers typically close a connection in
stages. First, the server performs a half-close by closing only the
write side of the read/write connection. The server then continues to
read from the connection until it receives a corresponding close by the
client, or until the server is reasonably certain that its own TCP stack
has received the client\'s acknowledgement of the packet(s) containing
the server\'s last response. Finally, the server fully closes the
connection.[¶](#section-9.6-10){.pilcrow}

It is unknown whether the reset problem is exclusive to TCP or might
also be found in other transport connection
protocols.[¶](#section-9.6-11){.pilcrow}

Note that a TCP connection that is half-closed by the client does not
delimit a request message, nor does it imply that the client is no
longer interested in a response. In general, transport signals cannot be
relied upon to signal edge cases, since HTTP/1.1 is independent of
transport.[¶](#section-9.6-12){.pilcrow}

### [9.7.](#section-9.7){.section-number .selfRef} [TLS Connection Initiation](#name-tls-connection-initiation){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-tls-connection-initiation}

Conceptually, HTTP/TLS is simply sending HTTP messages over a connection
secured via TLS \[[TLS13](#TLS13){.xref}\].[¶](#section-9.7-1){.pilcrow}

The HTTP client also acts as the TLS client. It initiates a connection
to the server on the appropriate port and sends the TLS ClientHello to
begin the TLS handshake. When the TLS handshake has finished, the client
may then initiate the first HTTP request. All HTTP data [MUST]{.bcp14}
be sent as TLS \"application data\" but is otherwise treated like a
normal connection for HTTP (including potential reuse as a persistent
connection).[¶](#section-9.7-2){.pilcrow}

### [9.8.](#section-9.8){.section-number .selfRef} [TLS Connection Closure](#name-tls-connection-closure){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-tls-connection-closure}

TLS uses an exchange of closure alerts prior to (non-error) connection
closure to provide secure connection closure; see [Section
6.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8446#section-6.1){.relref} of
\[[TLS13](#TLS13){.xref}\]. When a valid closure alert is received, an
implementation can be assured that no further data will be received on
that connection.[¶](#section-9.8-1){.pilcrow}

When an implementation knows that it has sent or received all the
message data that it cares about, typically by detecting HTTP message
boundaries, it might generate an \"incomplete close\" by sending a
closure alert and then closing the connection without waiting to receive
the corresponding closure alert from its
peer.[¶](#section-9.8-2){.pilcrow}

An incomplete close does not call into question the security of the data
already received, but it could indicate that subsequent data might have
been truncated. As TLS is not directly aware of HTTP message framing, it
is necessary to examine the HTTP data itself to determine whether
messages are complete. Handling of incomplete messages is defined in
[Section 8](#incomplete.messages){.xref}.[¶](#section-9.8-3){.pilcrow}

When encountering an incomplete close, a client [SHOULD]{.bcp14} treat
as completed all requests for which it has received
either[¶](#section-9.8-4){.pilcrow}

1.  [as much data as specified in the
    [Content-Length](#body.content-length){.xref} header field
    or[¶](#section-9.8-5.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-9.8-5.1}
2.  [the terminal zero-length chunk (when
    [Transfer-Encoding](#field.transfer-encoding){.xref} of chunked is
    used).[¶](#section-9.8-5.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-9.8-5.2}

A response that has neither chunked transfer coding nor Content-Length
is complete only if a valid closure alert has been received. Treating an
incomplete message as complete could expose implementations to
attack.[¶](#section-9.8-6){.pilcrow}

A client detecting an incomplete close [SHOULD]{.bcp14} recover
gracefully.[¶](#section-9.8-7){.pilcrow}

Clients [MUST]{.bcp14} send a closure alert before closing the
connection. Clients that do not expect to receive any more data
[MAY]{.bcp14} choose not to wait for the server\'s closure alert and
simply close the connection, thus generating an incomplete close on the
server side.[¶](#section-9.8-8){.pilcrow}

Servers [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be prepared to receive an incomplete close from
the client, since the client can often locate the end of server
data.[¶](#section-9.8-9){.pilcrow}

Servers [MUST]{.bcp14} attempt to initiate an exchange of closure alerts
with the client before closing the connection. Servers [MAY]{.bcp14}

## [11.](#section-11){.section-number .selfRef} [Security Considerations](#name-security-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-security-considerations}

This section is meant to inform developers, information providers, and
users about known security considerations relevant to HTTP message
syntax and parsing. Security considerations about HTTP semantics,
content, and routing are addressed in
\[[HTTP](#HTTP){.xref}\].[¶](#section-11-1){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-11.1 .section}
### [11.1.](#section-11.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Response Splitting](#name-response-splitting){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-response-splitting}

Response splitting (a.k.a. CRLF injection) is a common technique, used
in various attacks on Web usage, that exploits the line-based nature of
HTTP message framing and the ordered association of requests to
responses on persistent connections \[[Klein](#Klein){.xref}\]. This
technique can be particularly damaging when the requests pass through a
shared cache.[¶](#section-11.1-1){.pilcrow}

Response splitting exploits a vulnerability in servers (usually within
an application server) where an attacker can send encoded data within
some parameter of the request that is later decoded and echoed within
any of the response header fields of the response. If the decoded data
is crafted to look like the response has ended and a subsequent response
has begun, the response has been split, and the content within the
apparent second response is controlled by the attacker. The attacker can
then make any other request on the same persistent connection and trick
the recipients (including intermediaries) into believing that the second
half of the split is an authoritative answer to the second
request.[¶](#section-11.1-2){.pilcrow}

For example, a parameter within the request-target might be read by an
application server and reused within a redirect, resulting in the same
parameter being echoed in the Location header field of the response. If
the parameter is decoded by the application and not properly encoded
when placed in the response field, the attacker can send encoded CRLF
octets and other content that will make the application\'s single
response look like two or more responses.[¶](#section-11.1-3){.pilcrow}

A common defense against response splitting is to filter requests for
data that looks like encoded CR and LF (e.g., \"%0D\" and \"%0A\").
However, that assumes the application server is only performing URI
decoding rather than more obscure data transformations like charset
transcoding, XML entity translation, base64 decoding, sprintf
reformatting, etc. A more effective mitigation is to prevent anything
other than the server\'s core protocol libraries from sending a CR or LF
within the header section, which means restricting the output of header
fields to APIs that filter for bad octets and not allowing application
servers to write directly to the protocol
stream.[¶](#section-11.1-4){.pilcrow}

### [11.2.](#section-11.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Request Smuggling](#name-request-smuggling){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-request-smuggling}

Request smuggling (\[[Linhart](#Linhart){.xref}\]) is a technique that
exploits differences in protocol parsing among various recipients to
hide additional requests (which might otherwise be blocked or disabled
by policy) within an apparently harmless request. Like response
splitting, request smuggling can lead to a variety of attacks on HTTP
usage.[¶](#section-11.2-1){.pilcrow}

This specification has introduced new requirements on request parsing,
particularly with regard to message framing in [Section
6.3](#message.body.length){.xref}, to reduce the effectiveness of
request smuggling.[¶](#section-11.2-2){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-11.3 .section}
### [11.3.](#section-11.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Message Integrity](#name-message-integrity){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-message-integrity}

HTTP does not define a specific mechanism for ensuring message
integrity, instead relying on the error-detection ability of underlying
transport protocols and the use of length or chunk-delimited framing to
detect completeness. Historically, the lack of a single integrity
mechanism has been justified by the informal nature of most HTTP
communication. However, the prevalence of HTTP as an information access
mechanism has resulted in its increasing use within environments where
verification of message integrity is
crucial.[¶](#section-11.3-1){.pilcrow}

The mechanisms provided with the \"https\" scheme, such as authenticated
encryption, provide protection against modification of messages. Care is
needed, however, to ensure that connection closure cannot be used to
truncate messages (see [Section 9.8](#tls.connection.closure){.xref}).
User agents might refuse to accept incomplete messages or treat them
specially. For example, a browser being used to view medical history or
drug interaction information needs to indicate to the user when such
information is detected by the protocol to be incomplete, expired, or
corrupted during transfer. Such mechanisms might be selectively enabled
via user agent extensions or the presence of message integrity metadata
in a response.[¶](#section-11.3-2){.pilcrow}

The \"http\" scheme provides no protection against accidental or
malicious modification of messages.[¶](#section-11.3-3){.pilcrow}

Extensions to the protocol might be used to mitigate the risk of
unwanted modification of messages by intermediaries, even when the
\"https\" scheme is used. Integrity might be assured by using message
authentication codes or digital signatures that are selectively added to
messages via extensible metadata fields.[¶](#section-11.3-4){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-11.4 .section}
### [11.4.](#section-11.4){.section-number .selfRef} [Message Confidentiality](#name-message-confidentiality){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-message-confidentiality}

HTTP relies on underlying transport protocols to provide message
confidentiality when that is desired. HTTP has been specifically
designed to be independent of the transport protocol, such that it can
be used over many forms of encrypted connection, with the selection of
such transports being identified by the choice of URI scheme or within
user agent configuration.[¶](#section-11.4-1){.pilcrow}

The \"https\" scheme can be used to identify resources that require a
confidential connection, as described in [Section
4.2.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-4.2.2){.relref} of

## [Appendix B.](#appendix-B){.section-number .selfRef} [Differences between HTTP and MIME](#name-differences-between-http-an){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-differences-between-http-an}

HTTP/1.1 uses many of the constructs defined for the Internet Message
Format \[[RFC5322](#RFC5322){.xref}\] and Multipurpose Internet Mail
Extensions (MIME) \[[RFC2045](#RFC2045){.xref}\] to allow a message body
to be transmitted in an open variety of representations and with
extensible fields. However, some of these constructs have been
reinterpreted to better fit the needs of interactive communication,
leading to some differences in how MIME constructs are used within HTTP.
These differences were carefully chosen to optimize performance over
binary connections, allow greater freedom in the use of new media types,
ease date comparisons, and accommodate common
implementations.[¶](#appendix-B-1){.pilcrow}

This appendix describes specific areas where HTTP differs from MIME.
Proxies and gateways to and from strict MIME environments need to be
aware of these differences and provide the appropriate conversions where
necessary.[¶](#appendix-B-2){.pilcrow}

[]{#iref-header-fields-mime-version- .iref}
[]{#iref-mime-version-header-field-8 .iref}

HTTP is not a MIME-compliant protocol. However, messages can include a
single MIME-Version header field to indicate what version of the MIME
protocol was used to construct the message. Use of the MIME-Version
header field indicates that the message is in full conformance with the
MIME protocol (as defined in \[[RFC2045](#RFC2045){.xref}\]). Senders
are responsible for ensuring full conformance (where possible) when
exporting HTTP messages to strict MIME
environments.[¶](#appendix-B.1-1){.pilcrow}

### [B.2.](#appendix-B.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Conversion to Canonical Form](#name-conversion-to-canonical-for){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-conversion-to-canonical-for}

MIME requires that an Internet mail body part be converted to canonical
form prior to being transferred, as described in [Section
4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2049#section-4){.relref} of
\[[RFC2049](#RFC2049){.xref}\], and that content with a type of \"text\"
represents line breaks as CRLF, forbidding the use of CR or LF outside
of line break sequences \[[RFC2046](#RFC2046){.xref}\]. In contrast,
HTTP does not care whether CRLF, bare CR, or bare LF are used to
indicate a line break within content.[¶](#appendix-B.2-1){.pilcrow}

A proxy or gateway from HTTP to a strict MIME environment ought to
translate all line breaks within text media types to the RFC 2049
canonical form of CRLF. Note, however, this might be complicated by the
presence of a Content-Encoding and by the fact that HTTP allows the use
of some charsets that do not use octets 13 and 10 to represent CR and
LF, respectively.[¶](#appendix-B.2-2){.pilcrow}

Conversion will break any cryptographic checksums applied to the
original content unless the original content is already in canonical
form. Therefore, the canonical form is recommended for any content that
uses such checksums in HTTP.[¶](#appendix-B.2-3){.pilcrow}

### [B.3.](#appendix-B.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Conversion of Date Formats](#name-conversion-of-date-formats){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-conversion-of-date-formats}

HTTP/1.1 uses a restricted set of date formats ([Section
5.6.7](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-5.6.7){.relref} of
\[[HTTP](#HTTP){.xref}\]) to simplify the process of date comparison.
Proxies and gateways from other protocols ought to ensure that any Date
header field present in a message conforms to one of the HTTP/1.1
formats and rewrite the date if necessary.[¶](#appendix-B.3-1){.pilcrow}

### [B.4.](#appendix-B.4){.section-number .selfRef} [Conversion of Content-Encoding](#name-conversion-of-content-encod){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-conversion-of-content-encod}

MIME does not include any concept equivalent to HTTP\'s Content-Encoding
header field. Since this acts as a modifier on the media type, proxies
and gateways from HTTP to MIME-compliant protocols ought to either
change the value of the Content-Type header field or decode the
representation before forwarding the message. (Some experimental
applications of Content-Type for Internet mail have used a media-type
parameter of \";conversions=\<content-coding>\" to perform a function
equivalent to Content-Encoding. However, this parameter is not part of
the MIME standards.)[¶](#appendix-B.4-1){.pilcrow}

[]{#iref-content-transfer-encoding-h .iref}

HTTP does not use the Content-Transfer-Encoding field of MIME. Proxies
and gateways from MIME-compliant protocols to HTTP need to remove any
Content-Transfer-Encoding prior to delivering the response message to an
HTTP client.[¶](#appendix-B.5-1){.pilcrow}

Proxies and gateways from HTTP to MIME-compliant protocols are
responsible for ensuring that the message is in the correct format and
encoding for safe transport on that protocol, where \"safe transport\"
is defined by the limitations of the protocol being used. Such a proxy
or gateway ought to transform and label the data with an appropriate
Content-Transfer-Encoding if doing so will improve the likelihood of
safe transport over the destination
protocol.[¶](#appendix-B.5-2){.pilcrow}

HTTP implementations that share code with MHTML
\[[RFC2557](#RFC2557){.xref}\] implementations need to be aware of MIME
line length limitations. Since HTTP does not have this limitation, HTTP
does not fold long lines. MHTML messages being transported by HTTP
follow all conventions of MHTML, including line length limitations and
folding, canonicalization, etc., since HTTP transfers message-bodies
without modification and, aside from the \"multipart/byteranges\" type
([Section
14.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-14.6){.relref} of

### [C.1.](#appendix-C.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Changes from HTTP/0.9](#name-changes-from-http-09){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-changes-from-http-09}

Since HTTP/0.9 did not support header fields in a request, there is no
mechanism for it to support name-based virtual hosts (selection of
resource by inspection of the Host header field). Any server that
implements name-based virtual hosts ought to disable support for
HTTP/0.9. Most requests that appear to be HTTP/0.9 are, in fact, badly
constructed HTTP/1.x requests caused by a client failing to properly
encode the request-target.[¶](#appendix-C.1-1){.pilcrow}

#### [C.2.1.](#appendix-C.2.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Multihomed Web Servers](#name-multihomed-web-servers){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-multihomed-web-servers}

The requirements that clients and servers support the Host header field
([Section
7.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-7.2){.relref} of
\[[HTTP](#HTTP){.xref}\]), report an error if it is missing from an
HTTP/1.1 request, and accept absolute URIs ([Section
3.2](#request.target){.xref}) are among the most important changes
defined by HTTP/1.1.[¶](#appendix-C.2.1-1){.pilcrow}

Older HTTP/1.0 clients assumed a one-to-one relationship of IP addresses
and servers; there was no established mechanism for distinguishing the
intended server of a request other than the IP address to which that
request was directed. The Host header field was introduced during the
development of HTTP/1.1 and, though it was quickly implemented by most
HTTP/1.0 browsers, additional requirements were placed on all HTTP/1.1
requests in order to ensure complete adoption. At the time of this
writing, most HTTP-based services are dependent upon the Host header
field for targeting requests.[¶](#appendix-C.2.1-2){.pilcrow}
:::

::: {#compatibility.with.http.1.0.persistent.connections}
::: {#appendix-C.2.2 .section}
#### [C.2.2.](#appendix-C.2.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Keep-Alive Connections](#name-keep-alive-connections){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-keep-alive-connections}

In HTTP/1.0, each connection is established by the client prior to the
request and closed by the server after sending the response. However,
some implementations implement the explicitly negotiated
(\"Keep-Alive\") version of persistent connections described in [Section
19.7.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2068#section-19.7.1){.relref}
of \[[RFC2068](#RFC2068){.xref}\].[¶](#appendix-C.2.2-1){.pilcrow}

Some clients and servers might wish to be compatible with these previous
approaches to persistent connections, by explicitly negotiating for them
with a \"Connection: keep-alive\" request header field. However, some
experimental implementations of HTTP/1.0 persistent connections are
faulty; for example, if an HTTP/1.0 proxy server doesn\'t understand
Connection, it will erroneously forward that header field to the next
inbound server, which would result in a hung
connection.[¶](#appendix-C.2.2-2){.pilcrow}

One attempted solution was the introduction of a Proxy-Connection header
field, targeted specifically at proxies. In practice, this was also
unworkable, because proxies are often deployed in multiple layers,
bringing about the same problem discussed
above.[¶](#appendix-C.2.2-3){.pilcrow}

As a result, clients are encouraged not to send the Proxy-Connection
header field in any requests.[¶](#appendix-C.2.2-4){.pilcrow}

Clients are also encouraged to consider the use of \"Connection:
keep-alive\" in requests carefully; while they can enable persistent
connections with HTTP/1.0 servers, clients using them will need to
monitor the connection for \"hung\" requests (which indicate that the
client ought to stop sending the header field), and this mechanism ought
not be used by clients at all when a proxy is being
used.[¶](#appendix-C.2.2-5){.pilcrow}

#### [C.2.3.](#appendix-C.2.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Introduction of Transfer-Encoding](#name-introduction-of-transfer-en){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-introduction-of-transfer-en}

HTTP/1.1 introduces the
[Transfer-Encoding](#field.transfer-encoding){.xref} header field
([Section 6.1](#field.transfer-encoding){.xref}). Transfer codings need
to be decoded prior to forwarding an HTTP message over a MIME-compliant
protocol.[¶](#appendix-C.2.3-1){.pilcrow}

Most of the sections introducing HTTP\'s design goals, history,
architecture, conformance criteria, protocol versioning, URIs, message
routing, and header fields have been moved to \[[HTTP](#HTTP){.xref}\].
This document has been reduced to just the messaging syntax and
connection management requirements specific to
HTTP/1.1.[¶](#appendix-C.3-1){.pilcrow}

Bare CRs have been prohibited outside of content. ([Section
2.2](#message.parsing){.xref})[¶](#appendix-C.3-2){.pilcrow}

The ABNF definition of [authority-form](#authority-form){.xref} has
changed from the more general authority component of a URI (in which
port is optional) to the specific host:port format that is required by
CONNECT. ([Section
3.2.3](#authority-form){.xref})[¶](#appendix-C.3-3){.pilcrow}

Recipients are required to avoid smuggling/splitting attacks when
processing an ambiguous message framing. ([Section
6.1](#field.transfer-encoding){.xref})[¶](#appendix-C.3-4){.pilcrow}

In the ABNF for chunked extensions, (bad) whitespace around \";\" and
\"=\" has been reintroduced. Whitespace was removed in
\[[RFC7230](#RFC7230){.xref}\], but that change was found to break
existing implementations. ([Section
7.1.1](#chunked.extension){.xref})[¶](#appendix-C.3-5){.pilcrow}

Trailer field semantics now transcend the specifics of chunked transfer
coding. The decoding algorithm for chunked ([Section
7.1.3](#decoding.chunked){.xref}) has been updated to encourage
storage/forwarding of trailer fields separately from the header section,
to only allow merging into the header section if the recipient knows the
corresponding field definition permits and defines how to merge, and
otherwise to discard the trailer fields instead of merging. The trailer
part is now called the trailer section to be more consistent with the
header section and more distinct from a body part. ([Section
7.1.2](#chunked.trailer.section){.xref})[¶](#appendix-C.3-6){.pilcrow}

Transfer coding parameters called \"q\" are disallowed in order to avoid
conflicts with the use of ranks in the TE header field. ([Section
7.3](#transfer.coding.registry){.xref})[¶](#appendix-C.3-7){.pilcrow}
