# RFC 8784 {#rfcnum}

# Mixing Preshared Keys in the Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2) for Post-quantum Security {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

The possibility of quantum computers poses a serious challenge to
cryptographic algorithms deployed widely today. The Internet Key
Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2) is one example of a cryptosystem
that could be broken; someone storing VPN communications today could
decrypt them at a later time when a quantum computer is available. It is
anticipated that IKEv2 will be extended to support quantum-secure key
exchange algorithms; however, that is not likely to happen in the near
term. To address this problem before then, this document describes an
extension of IKEv2 to allow it to be resistant to a quantum computer by
using preshared keys.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

Recent achievements in developing quantum computers demonstrate that it
is probably feasible to build one that is cryptographically significant.
If such a computer is implemented, many of the cryptographic algorithms
and protocols currently in use would be insecure. A quantum computer
would be able to solve Diffie-Hellman (DH) and Elliptic Curve
Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) problems in polynomial time
\[[C2PQ](#I-D.hoffman-c2pq){.xref}\], and this would imply that the
security of existing IKEv2 \[[RFC7296](#RFC7296){.xref}\] systems would
be compromised. IKEv1 \[[RFC2409](#RFC2409){.xref}\], when used with
strong preshared keys, is not vulnerable to quantum attacks because
those keys are one of the inputs to the key derivation function. If the
preshared key has sufficient entropy and the Pseudorandom Function
(PRF), encryption, and authentication transforms are quantum secure,
then the resulting system is believed to be quantum secure \-- that is,
secure against classical attackers of today or future attackers with a
quantum computer.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

This document describes a way to extend IKEv2 to have a similar
property; assuming that the two end systems share a long secret key,
then the resulting exchange is quantum secure. By bringing post-quantum
security to IKEv2, this document removes the need to use an obsolete
version of IKE in order to achieve that security
goal.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

The general idea is that we add an additional secret that is shared
between the initiator and the responder; this secret is in addition to
the authentication method that is already provided within IKEv2. We stir
this secret into the SK_d value, which is used to generate the key
material (KEYMAT) for the Child Security Associations (SAs) and the
SKEYSEED for the IKE SAs created as a result of the initial IKE SA
rekey. This secret provides quantum resistance to the IPsec SAs and any
subsequent IKE SAs. We also stir the secret into the SK_pi and SK_pr
values; this allows both sides to detect a secret mismatch
cleanly.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

It was considered important to minimize the changes to IKEv2. The
existing mechanisms to perform authentication and key exchange remain in
place (that is, we continue to perform (EC)DH and potentially PKI
authentication if configured). This document does not replace the
authentication checks that the protocol does; instead, they are
strengthened by using an additional secret
key.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

## [2.](#section-2){.section-number .selfRef} [Assumptions](#name-assumptions){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-assumptions}

We assume that each IKE peer has a list of Post-quantum Preshared Keys
(PPKs) along with their identifiers (PPK_ID), and any potential IKE
initiator selects which PPK to use with any specific responder. In
addition, implementations have a configurable flag that determines
whether this PPK is mandatory. This PPK is independent of the preshared
key (if any) that the IKEv2 protocol uses to perform authentication
(because the preshared key in IKEv2 is not used for any key derivation
and thus doesn\'t protect against quantum computers). The PPK-specific
configuration that is assumed to be on each node consists of the
following tuple:[¶](#section-2-1){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-2-2 .artwork .art-text .alignLeft}
    Peer, PPK, PPK_ID, mandatory_or_not

[¶](#section-2-2){.pilcrow}
:::

We assume the reader is familiar with the payload notation defined in
[Section
1.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7296#section-1.2){.relref} of
\[[RFC7296](#RFC7296){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2-3){.pilcrow}

## [3.](#section-3){.section-number .selfRef} [Exchanges](#name-exchanges){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-exchanges}

If the initiator is configured to use a PPK with the responder (whether
or not the use of the PPK is mandatory), then it [MUST]{.bcp14} include
a notification USE_PPK in the IKE_SA_INIT request message as
follows:[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-3-2 .artwork .art-text .alignLeft}
    Initiator                       Responder
    ------------------------------------------------------------------
    HDR, SAi1, KEi, Ni, N(USE_PPK)  --->

[¶](#section-3-2){.pilcrow}
:::

N(USE_PPK) is a status notification payload with the type 16435; it has
a protocol ID of 0, no Security Parameter Index (SPI), and no
notification data associated with it.[¶](#section-3-3){.pilcrow}

If the initiator needs to resend this initial message with a COOKIE
notification, then the resend would include the USE_PPK notification if
the original message did (see [Section
2.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7296#section-2.6){.relref} of
\[[RFC7296](#RFC7296){.xref}\]).[¶](#section-3-4){.pilcrow}

If the responder does not support this specification or does not have
any PPK configured, then it ignores the received notification (as
defined in \[[RFC7296](#RFC7296){.xref}\] for unknown status
notifications) and continues with the IKEv2 protocol as normal.
Otherwise, the responder replies with the IKE_SA_INIT message, including
a USE_PPK notification in the response:[¶](#section-3-5){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-3-6 .artwork .art-text .alignLeft}
    Initiator                       Responder
    ------------------------------------------------------------------
                    <--- HDR, SAr1, KEr, Nr, [CERTREQ,] N(USE_PPK)

[¶](#section-3-6){.pilcrow}
:::

When the initiator receives this reply, it checks whether the responder
included the USE_PPK notification. If the responder did not include the
USE_PPK notification and the flag mandatory_or_not indicates that using
PPKs is mandatory for communication with this responder, then the
initiator [MUST]{.bcp14} abort the exchange. This situation may happen
in case of misconfiguration, i.e., when the initiator believes it has a
mandatory-to-use PPK for the responder and the responder either doesn\'t
support PPKs at all or doesn\'t have any PPK configured for the
initiator. See [Section 6](#Security){.xref} for discussion of the
possible impacts of this situation.[¶](#section-3-7){.pilcrow}

If the responder did not include the USE_PPK notification and using a
PPK for this particular responder is optional, then the initiator
continues with the IKEv2 protocol as normal, without using
PPKs.[¶](#section-3-8){.pilcrow}

If the responder did include the USE_PPK notification, then the
initiator selects a PPK, along with its identifier PPK_ID. Then, it
computes this modification of the standard IKEv2 key derivation from
[Section
2.14](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7296#section-2.14){.relref} of
\[[RFC7296](#RFC7296){.xref}\]:[¶](#section-3-9){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-3-10}
``` {.sourcecode .lang-pseudocode}
 SKEYSEED = prf(Ni | Nr, g^ir)
 {SK_d' | SK_ai | SK_ar | SK_ei | SK_er | SK_pi' | SK_pr'}
                 = prf+ (SKEYSEED, Ni | Nr | SPIi | SPIr)

 SK_d  = prf+ (PPK, SK_d')
 SK_pi = prf+ (PPK, SK_pi')
 SK_pr = prf+ (PPK, SK_pr')
```

[¶](#section-3-10){.pilcrow}
:::

That is, we use the standard IKEv2 key derivation process, except that
the three resulting subkeys SK_d, SK_pi, and SK_pr (marked with primes
in the formula above) are then run through the prf+ again, this time
using the PPK as the key. The result is the unprimed versions of these
keys, which are then used as inputs to subsequent steps of the IKEv2
exchange.[¶](#section-3-11){.pilcrow}

Using a prf+ construction ensures that it is always possible to get the
resulting keys of the same size as the initial ones, even if the
underlying PRF has an output size different from its key size. Note that
at the time of this writing, all PRFs defined for use in IKEv2 (see the
\"Transform Type 2 - Pseudorandom Function Transform IDs\" subregistry
\[[IANA-IKEV2](#IANA-IKEV2){.xref}\]) have an output size equal to the
(preferred) key size. For such PRFs, only the first iteration of prf+ is
needed:[¶](#section-3-12){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-3-13}
``` {.sourcecode .lang-pseudocode}
 SK_d  = prf (PPK, SK_d'  | 0x01)
 SK_pi = prf (PPK, SK_pi' | 0x01)
 SK_pr = prf (PPK, SK_pr' | 0x01)
```

[¶](#section-3-13){.pilcrow}
:::

Note that the PPK is used in SK_d, SK_pi, and SK_pr calculations only
during the initial IKE SA setup. It [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be used when
these subkeys are calculated as result of IKE SA rekey, resumption, or
other similar operations.[¶](#section-3-14){.pilcrow}

The initiator then sends the IKE_AUTH request message, including the
PPK_ID value as follows:[¶](#section-3-15){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-3-16 .artwork .art-text .alignLeft}
    Initiator                       Responder
    ------------------------------------------------------------------
    HDR, SK {IDi, [CERT,] [CERTREQ,]
        [IDr,] AUTH, SAi2,
        TSi, TSr, N(PPK_IDENTITY, PPK_ID), [N(NO_PPK_AUTH)]}  --->

[¶](#section-3-16){.pilcrow}
:::

PPK_IDENTITY is a status notification with the type 16436; it has a
protocol ID of 0, no SPI, and notification data that consists of the
identifier PPK_ID.[¶](#section-3-17){.pilcrow}

A situation may happen when the responder has some PPKs but doesn\'t
have a PPK with the PPK_ID received from the initiator. In this case,
the responder cannot continue with the PPK (in particular, it cannot
authenticate the initiator), but the responder could be able to continue
with the normal IKEv2 protocol if the initiator provided its
authentication data computed as in the normal IKEv2 without using PPKs.
For this purpose, if using PPKs for communication with this responder is
optional for the initiator (based on the mandatory_or_not flag), then
the initiator [MUST]{.bcp14} include a NO_PPK_AUTH notification in the
above message. This notification informs the responder that PPKs are
optional and allows for authenticating the initiator without using
PPKs.[¶](#section-3-18){.pilcrow}

NO_PPK_AUTH is a status notification with the type 16437; it has a
protocol ID of 0 and no SPI. The Notification Data field contains the
initiator\'s authentication data computed using SK_pi\', which has been
computed without using PPKs. This is the same data that would normally
be placed in the Authentication Data field of an AUTH payload. Since the
Auth Method field is not present in the notification, the authentication
method used for computing the authentication data [MUST]{.bcp14} be the
same as the method indicated in the AUTH payload. Note that if the
initiator decides to include the NO_PPK_AUTH notification, the initiator
needs to perform authentication data computation twice, which may
consume computation power (e.g., if digital signatures are
involved).[¶](#section-3-19){.pilcrow}

When the responder receives this encrypted exchange, it first computes
the values:[¶](#section-3-20){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-3-21}
``` {.sourcecode .lang-pseudocode}
 SKEYSEED = prf(Ni | Nr, g^ir)
 {SK_d' | SK_ai | SK_ar | SK_ei | SK_er | SK_pi' | SK_pr'}
                 = prf+ (SKEYSEED, Ni | Nr | SPIi | SPIr)
```

[¶](#section-3-21){.pilcrow}
:::

The responder then uses the SK_ei/SK_ai values to decrypt/check the
message and then scans through the payloads for the PPK_ID attached to
the PPK_IDENTITY notification. If no PPK_IDENTITY notification is found
and the peers successfully exchanged USE_PPK notifications in the
IKE_SA_INIT exchange, then the responder [MUST]{.bcp14} send back an
AUTHENTICATION_FAILED notification and then fail the
negotiation.[¶](#section-3-22){.pilcrow}

If the PPK_IDENTITY notification contains a PPK_ID that is not known to
the responder or is not configured for use for the identity from the IDi
payload, then the responder checks whether using PPKs for this initiator
is mandatory and whether the initiator included a NO_PPK_AUTH
notification in the message. If using PPKs is mandatory or no
NO_PPK_AUTH notification is found, then the responder [MUST]{.bcp14}
send back an AUTHENTICATION_FAILED notification and then fail the
negotiation. Otherwise (when a PPK is optional and the initiator
included a NO_PPK_AUTH notification), the responder [MAY]{.bcp14}
continue the regular IKEv2 protocol, except that it uses the data from
the NO_PPK_AUTH notification as the authentication data (which usually
resides in the AUTH payload) for the purpose of the initiator
authentication. Note that the authentication method is still indicated
in the AUTH payload.[¶](#section-3-23){.pilcrow}

[Table 1](#table1){.xref} summarizes the above logic for the
responder:[¶](#section-3-24){.pilcrow}

:::

When the initiator receives the response, it checks for the presence of
the PPK_IDENTITY notification. If it receives one, it marks the SA as
using the configured PPK to generate SK_d, SK_pi, and SK_pr (as shown
above); the content of the received PPK_IDENTITY (if any) [MUST]{.bcp14}
be ignored. If the initiator does not receive the PPK_IDENTITY, it
[MUST]{.bcp14} either fail the IKE SA negotiation sending the
AUTHENTICATION_FAILED notification in the INFORMATIONAL exchange (if the
PPK was configured as mandatory) or continue without using the PPK (if
the PPK was not configured as mandatory and the initiator included the
NO_PPK_AUTH notification in the request).[¶](#section-3-30){.pilcrow}

If the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) is used in the IKE_AUTH
exchange, then the initiator doesn\'t include the AUTH payload in the
first request message; however, the responder sends back the AUTH
payload in the first reply. The peers then exchange AUTH payloads after
EAP is successfully completed. As a result, the responder sends the AUTH
payload twice \-- in the first and last IKE_AUTH reply message \-- while
the initiator sends the AUTH payload only in the last IKE_AUTH request.
See more details about EAP authentication in IKEv2 in [Section
2.16](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7296#section-2.16){.relref} of
\[[RFC7296](#RFC7296){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3-31){.pilcrow}

The general rule for using a PPK in the IKE_AUTH exchange, which covers
the EAP authentication case too, is that the initiator includes a
PPK_IDENTITY (and optionally a NO_PPK_AUTH) notification in the request
message containing the AUTH payload. Therefore, in case of EAP, the
responder always computes the AUTH payload in the first IKE_AUTH reply
message without using a PPK (by means of SK_pr\'), since PPK_ID is not
yet known to the responder. Once the IKE_AUTH request message containing
the PPK_IDENTITY notification is received, the responder follows the
rules described above for the non-EAP authentication
case.[¶](#section-3-32){.pilcrow}

Note that the diagram above shows both the cases when the responder uses
a PPK and when it chooses not to use it (provided the initiator has
included the NO_PPK_AUTH notification); thus, the responder\'s
PPK_IDENTITY notification is marked as optional. Also, note that the

## [4.](#section-4){.section-number .selfRef} [Upgrade Procedure](#name-upgrade-procedure){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-upgrade-procedure}

This algorithm was designed so that someone can introduce PPKs into an
existing IKE network without causing network
disruption.[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

In the initial phase of the network upgrade, the network administrator
would visit each IKE node and configure:[¶](#section-4-2){.pilcrow}

-   [The set of PPKs (and corresponding PPK_IDs) that this node would
    need to know.[¶](#section-4-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-4-3.1}
-   [The PPK that will be used for each peer that this node would
    initiate to.[¶](#section-4-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-4-3.2}
-   [The value \"false\" for the mandatory_or_not flag for each peer
    that this node would initiate to (thus indicating that the use of
    PPKs is not
    mandatory).[¶](#section-4-3.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-4-3.3}

With this configuration, the node will continue to operate with nodes
that have not yet been upgraded. This is due to the USE_PPK notification
and the NO_PPK_AUTH notification; if the initiator has not been
upgraded, it will not send the USE_PPK notification (and so the
responder will know that the peers will not use a PPK). If the responder
has not been upgraded, it will not send the USE_PPK notification (and so
the initiator will know to not use a PPK). If both peers have been
upgraded but the responder isn\'t yet configured with the PPK for the
initiator, then the responder could continue with the standard IKEv2
protocol if the initiator sent a NO_PPK_AUTH notification. If both the
responder and initiator have been upgraded and properly configured, they
will both realize it, and the Child SAs will be quantum
secure.[¶](#section-4-4){.pilcrow}

As an optional second step, after all nodes have been upgraded, the
administrator should then go back through the nodes and mark the use of
a PPK as mandatory. This will not affect the strength against a passive
attacker, but it would mean that an active attacker with a quantum
computer (which is sufficiently fast to be able to break the (EC)DH in
real time) would not be able to perform a downgrade
attack.[¶](#section-4-5){.pilcrow}

### [5.1.](#section-5.1){.section-number .selfRef} [PPK_ID Format](#name-ppk_id-format){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-ppk_id-format}

This standard requires that both the initiator and the responder have a
secret PPK value, with the responder selecting the PPK based on the
PPK_ID that the initiator sends. In this standard, both the initiator
and the responder are configured with fixed PPK and PPK_ID values and
perform the lookup based on the PPK_ID value. It is anticipated that
later specifications will extend this technique to allow dynamically
changing PPK values. To facilitate such an extension, we specify that
the PPK_ID the initiator sends will have its first octet be the PPK_ID
type value. This document defines two values for the PPK_ID
type:[¶](#section-5.1-1){.pilcrow}

-   [PPK_ID_OPAQUE (1) - For this type, the format of the PPK_ID (and
    the PPK itself) is not specified by this document; it is assumed to
    be mutually intelligible by both the initiator and the responder.
    This PPK_ID type is intended for those implementations that choose
    not to disclose the type of PPK to active
    attackers.[¶](#section-5.1-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.1-2.1}
-   [PPK_ID_FIXED (2) - In this case, the format of the PPK_ID and the
    PPK are fixed octet strings; the remaining bytes of the PPK_ID are a
    configured value. We assume that there is a fixed mapping between
    PPK_ID and PPK, which is configured locally to both the initiator
    and the responder. The responder can use the PPK_ID to look up the
    corresponding PPK value. Not all implementations are able to
    configure arbitrary octet strings; to improve the potential
    interoperability, it is recommended that, in the PPK_ID_FIXED case,
    both the PPK and the PPK_ID strings be limited to the base64
    character set

This document doesn\'t explicitly require that the PPK be unique for
each pair of peers. If this is the case, then this solution provides
full peer authentication, but it also means that each host must have as
many independent PPKs as peers it is going to communicate with. As the
number of peers grows, the PPKs will not
scale.[¶](#section-5.2.2-1){.pilcrow}

It is possible to use a single PPK for a group of users. Since each peer
uses classical public key cryptography in addition to a PPK for key
exchange and authentication, members of the group can neither
impersonate each other nor read each other\'s traffic unless they use
quantum computers to break public key operations. However, group members
can record any traffic they have access to that comes from other group
members and decrypt it later, when they get access to a quantum
computer.[¶](#section-5.2.2-2){.pilcrow}

In addition, the fact that the PPK is known to a (potentially large)
group of users makes it more susceptible to theft. When an attacker
equipped with a quantum computer gets access to a group PPK, all
communications inside the group are
revealed.[¶](#section-5.2.2-3){.pilcrow}

For these reasons, using a group PPK is [NOT
RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14}.[¶](#section-5.2.2-4){.pilcrow}

#### [5.2.3.](#section-5.2.3){.section-number .selfRef} [PPK-Only Authentication](#name-ppk-only-authentication){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-ppk-only-authentication}

If quantum computers become a reality, classical public key cryptography
will provide little security, so administrators may find it attractive
not to use it at all for authentication. This will reduce the number of
credentials they need to maintain because they only need to maintain PPK
credentials. Combining group PPK and PPK-only authentication is [NOT
RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14} since, in this case, any member of the group can
impersonate any other member, even without the help of quantum
computers.[¶](#section-5.2.3-1){.pilcrow}

PPK-only authentication can be achieved in IKEv2 if the NULL
Authentication method \[[RFC7619](#RFC7619){.xref}\] is employed.
Without PPK, the NULL Authentication method provides no authentication
of the peers; however, since a PPK is stirred into the SK_pi and the
SK_pr, the peers become authenticated if a PPK is in use. Using PPKs
[MUST]{.bcp14} be mandatory for the peers if they advertise support for
PPKs in IKE_SA_INIT and use NULL Authentication. Additionally, since the
peers are authenticated via PPKs, the ID Type in the IDi/IDr payloads
[SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} be ID_NULL, despite using the NULL Authentication
method.[¶](#section-5.2.3-2){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-6 .section}
## [6.](#section-6){.section-number .selfRef} [Security Considerations](#name-security-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-security-considerations}

A critical consideration is how to ensure the randomness of this
post-quantum preshared key. Quantum computers are able to perform
Grover\'s algorithm \[[GROVER](#GROVER){.xref}\]; that effectively
halves the size of a symmetric key. In addition, an adversary
impersonating the server, even with a conventional computer, can perform
a dictionary search over plausible post-quantum preshared key values.
The strongest practice is to ensure that any post-quantum preshared key
contains at least 256 bits of entropy; this will provide 128 bits of
post-quantum security, while providing security against conventional
dictionary attacks. That provides the security equivalent to Category 5
as defined in the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Call for Proposals
\[[NISTPQCFP](#NISTPQCFP){.xref}\]. Deriving a post-quantum preshared
key from a password, name, or other low-entropy source is not secure
because of these known attacks.[¶](#section-6-1){.pilcrow}

With this protocol, the computed SK_d is a function of the PPK. Assuming
that the PPK has sufficient entropy (for example, at least 2^256^
possible values), even if an attacker was able to recover the rest of
the inputs to the PRF function, it would be infeasible to use Grover\'s
algorithm with a quantum computer to recover the SK_d value. Similarly,
all keys that are a function of SK_d, which include all Child SA keys
and all keys for subsequent IKE SAs (created when the initial IKE SA is
rekeyed), are also quantum secure (assuming that the PPK was of high
enough entropy and that all the subkeys are sufficiently
long).[¶](#section-6-2){.pilcrow}

An attacker with a quantum computer that can decrypt the initial IKE SA
has access to all the information exchanged over it, such as identities
of the peers, configuration parameters, and all negotiated IPsec SA
information (including traffic selectors), with the exception of the
cryptographic keys used by the IPsec SAs, which are protected by the
PPK.[¶](#section-6-3){.pilcrow}

Deployments that treat this information as sensitive or that send other
sensitive data (like cryptographic keys) over IKE SAs [MUST]{.bcp14}
rekey the IKE SA before the sensitive information is sent to ensure this
information is protected by the PPK. It is possible to create a
childless IKE SA as specified in \[[RFC6023](#RFC6023){.xref}\]. This
prevents Child SA configuration information from being transmitted in
the original IKE SA that is not protected by a PPK. Some information
related to IKE SA that is sent in the IKE_AUTH exchange, such as peer
identities, feature notifications, vendor IDs, etc., cannot be hidden
from the attack described above, even if the additional IKE SA rekey is
performed.[¶](#section-6-4){.pilcrow}

In addition, the policy [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be set to negotiate only
quantum-secure symmetric algorithms; while this RFC doesn\'t claim to
give advice as to what algorithms are secure (as that may change based
on future cryptographical results), below is a list of defined IKEv2 and
IPsec algorithms that should not be used, as they are known to provide
less than 128 bits of post-quantum security:[¶](#section-6-5){.pilcrow}

-   [Any IKEv2 encryption algorithm, PRF, or integrity algorithm with a
    key size less than 256
    bits.[¶](#section-6-6.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-6-6.1}
-   [Any ESP transform with a key size less than 256
    bits.[¶](#section-6-6.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-6-6.2}
-   [PRF_AES128_XCBC and PRF_AES128_CBC: even though they can use as
    input a key of arbitrary size, such input keys are converted into a
    128-bit key for internal
    use.[¶](#section-6-6.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-6-6.3}

[Section 3](#Exchanges){.xref} requires the initiator to abort the
initial exchange if using PPKs is mandatory for it but the responder
does not include the USE_PPK notification in the response. In this
situation, when the initiator aborts the negotiation, it leaves a
half-open IKE SA on the responder (because IKE_SA_INIT completes
successfully from the responder\'s point of view). This half-open SA
will eventually expire and be deleted, but if the initiator continues
its attempts to create IKE SA with a high enough rate, then the
responder may consider it a denial-of-service (DoS) attack and take
protective measures (see \[[RFC8019](#RFC8019){.xref}\] for more
details). In this situation, it is [RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14} that the
initiator cache the negative result of the negotiation and not attempt
to create it again for some time. This period of time may vary, but it
is believed that waiting for at least few minutes will not cause the
responder to treat it as a DoS attack. Note that this situation would
most likely be a result of misconfiguration, and some reconfiguration of
the peers would probably be needed.[¶](#section-6-7){.pilcrow}

If using PPKs is optional for both peers and they authenticate
themselves using digital signatures, then an attacker in between,
equipped with a quantum computer capable of breaking public key
operations in real time, is able to mount a downgrade attack by removing
the USE_PPK notification from the IKE_SA_INIT and forging digital
signatures in the subsequent exchange. If using PPKs is mandatory for at
least one of the peers or if a preshared key mode is used for
authentication, then the attack will be detected and the SA won\'t be
created.[¶](#section-6-8){.pilcrow}

If using PPKs is mandatory for the initiator, then an attacker able to
eavesdrop and inject packets into the network can prevent creation of an
IKE SA by mounting the following attack. The attacker intercepts the
initial request containing the USE_PPK notification and injects a forged
response containing no USE_PPK. If the attacker manages to inject this
packet before the responder sends a genuine response, then the initiator
would abort the exchange. To thwart this kind of attack, it is
[RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14} that, if using PPKs is mandatory for the initiator
and the received response doesn\'t contain the USE_PPK notification, the
initiator not abort the exchange immediately. Instead, it waits for more
response messages, retransmitting the request as if no responses were
received at all, until either the received message contains the USE_PPK
notification or the exchange times out (see [Section
2.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7296#section-2.4){.relref} of
\[[RFC7296](#RFC7296){.xref}\] for more details about retransmission
timers in IKEv2). If none of the received responses contains USE_PPK,
then the exchange is aborted.[¶](#section-6-9){.pilcrow}

If using a PPK is optional for both peers, then in case of
misconfiguration (e.g., mismatched PPK_ID), the IKE SA will be created
without protection against quantum computers. It is advised that if a
PPK was configured but was not used for a particular IKE SA, then
implementations [SHOULD]{.bcp14} audit this
event.[¶](#section-6-10){.pilcrow}

## [Appendix A.](#section-appendix.a){.section-number .selfRef} [Discussion and Rationale](#name-discussion-and-rationale){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-discussion-and-rationale}

The primary goal of this document is to augment the IKEv2 protocol to
provide protection against quantum computers without requiring novel
cryptographic algorithms. The idea behind this document is that while a
quantum computer can easily reconstruct the shared secret of an (EC)DH
exchange, it cannot as easily recover a secret from a symmetric
exchange. This document makes the SK_d (and thus also the IPsec KEYMAT
and any subsequent IKE SA\'s SKEYSEED) depend on both the symmetric PPK
and the Diffie-Hellman exchange. If we assume that the attacker knows
everything except the PPK during the key exchange and there are 2^n^
plausible PPKs, then a quantum computer (using Grover\'s algorithm)
would take O(2^n/2^) time to recover the PPK. So, even if the (EC)DH can
be trivially solved, the attacker still can\'t recover any key material
(except for the SK_ei, SK_er, SK_ai, and SK_ar values for the initial
IKE exchange) unless they can find the PPK, which is too difficult if
the PPK has enough entropy (for example, 256 bits). Note that we do
allow an attacker with a quantum computer to rederive the keying
material for the initial IKE SA; this was a compromise to allow the
responder to select the correct PPK
quickly.[¶](#section-appendix.a-1){.pilcrow}

Another goal of this protocol is to minimize the number of changes
within the IKEv2 protocol, in particular, within the cryptography of
IKEv2. By limiting our changes to notifications and only adjusting the
SK_d, SK_pi, and SK_pr, it is hoped that this would be implementable,
even on systems that perform most of the IKEv2 processing in
hardware.[¶](#section-appendix.a-2){.pilcrow}

A third goal is to be friendly to incremental deployment in operational
networks for which we might not want to have a global shared key or for
which quantum-secure IKEv2 is rolled out incrementally. This is why we
specifically try to allow the PPK to be dependent on the peer and why we
allow the PPK to be configured as
optional.[¶](#section-appendix.a-3){.pilcrow}

A fourth goal is to avoid violating any of the security properties
provided by IKEv2.[¶](#section-appendix.a-4){.pilcrow}
