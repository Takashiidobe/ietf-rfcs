# RFC 8715 {#rfcnum}

# IETF Administrative Support Activity 2.0: Update to the Process for Selection of Trustees for the IETF Trust {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

This document captures the rationale for the changes introduced in RFC
8714, \"Update to the Process for Selection of Trustees for the IETF
Trust\".[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

At the time RFC 8714 was published, the changes to the IETF
Administrative Support Activity, Version 2.0 (IASA 2.0) had an impact on
the IETF Trust because members of the IETF Administrative Oversight
Committee (IAOC), which was being phased out, had served as Trustees of
the IETF Trust. This document provides background on the past IETF Trust
arrangements, explains the effect of the rules in the founding documents
during the transition to the new arrangement, and provides a rationale
for the update.[¶](#section-abstract-2){.pilcrow}

This document captures the rationale for the changes introduced in
\[[RFC8714](#RFC8714){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

At the time \[[RFC8714](#RFC8714){.xref}\] was published, the changes to
the IETF Administrative Support Activity, Version 2.0 (IASA 2.0) had an
impact on the IETF Trust \[[RFC4071](#RFC4071){.xref}\]
\[[RFC4371](#RFC4371){.xref}\] \[[RFC8711](#RFC8711){.xref}\]. This is
because members of the IETF Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC),
which was being phased out, had served as Trustees of the IETF Trust. A
minimal change regarding the selection of the Trustees is implemented by
\[[RFC8714](#RFC8714){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

This companion memo provides some background on the details of the past
IETF Trust arrangements, explains the effect of the rules in the
founding documents during the transition to the new arrangement, and
provides a rationale for the update.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

::: {#background}
::: {#section-2 .section}
## [2.](#section-2){.section-number .selfRef} [Background](#name-background){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-background}

The purpose of the IETF Trust is to acquire, hold, maintain, and license
certain existing and future intellectual property and other property
used in connection with the administration of the IETF
\[[RFC8714](#RFC8714){.xref}\]. The intellectual property is, for
instance, rights that the IETF contributors grant for text in RFCs and
Internet-Drafts. The IETF Trust also manages trademarks such as \"IETF\"
and domain names such as \"ietf.org\". The IETF Trust is also serving
the broader Internet community by holding domains and trademarks
associated with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)
\[[RFC7979](#RFC7979){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2-1){.pilcrow}

The IETF Trust is a legal entity, registered in the Commonwealth of
Virginia \[[Trust-FD](#Trust-FD){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2-2){.pilcrow}

Previously, the members of the IAOC also served as ex officio Trustees
of the IETF Trust. The founding documents specify persons eligible to
become Trustees as having to be then-current members of the IAOC
\[[Trust-FD](#Trust-FD){.xref}\]. The documents also specify that if for
any reason there are fewer than three individuals serving as Trustees,
then the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG), or the IESG\'s
successor as the leadership of the IETF, shall appoint one or more
individuals to serve in a temporary capacity as Trustee(s) until
eligible persons can be found.[¶](#section-2-3){.pilcrow}

In the previous system, there were eight voting members of the IAOC. Two
were named by the IETF Nominating Committee (NomCom), one by the
Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG), one by the Internet
Architecture Board (IAB), and one by the Internet Society (ISOC) Board
of Trustees. There were three ex officio members via their roles as IETF
Chair, ISOC CEO, and IAB Chair. In addition, the IETF Administrative
Director (IAD) was a non-voting IAOC member who also served as one of
the Trustees.[¶](#section-2-4){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-3 .section}
## [3.](#section-3){.section-number .selfRef} [General Approach](#name-general-approach){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-general-approach}

There were two basic approaches to resolving the issue with the Trustees
once the IAOC ceased to exist. One approach would be to merge all IETF
Trust functions in the new IASA structure and under the new legal
entity. However, this memo advocates a second approach where the IETF
Trust is kept independent.[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

The rationale for advocating the second approach is, in part, to
minimize changes to the IETF Trust while the IETF\'s administrative
structure is undergoing major change. In addition, the IETF Trust and
other administrative IETF processes are quite different. While very
important, the IETF Trust is a low-activity entity where changes are
minimal and gradual, and there are no pressing
issues.[¶](#section-3-2){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-4 .section}
## [4.](#section-4){.section-number .selfRef} [Changing the Way Trustees Are Selected](#name-changing-the-way-trustees-a){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-changing-the-way-trustees-a}

When the Trustees were serving on both the IETF Trust and the IAOC, many
of the requirements for naming a particular group of people were driven
by the IAOC\'s requirements. For the IETF Trust in the new model, some
of those arrangements were rethought, both in terms of the number and
source of the Trustees, as well as the desired qualifications and length
of terms.[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

Several options were possible, of course. A newly designed selection
process could have been devised, but in this document we argue for
limited change based largely on the fact that a) the IETF Trust
arrangements worked generally well, b) the expected time commitment is
expected to be modest, and c) the assets need very careful
management.[¶](#section-4-2){.pilcrow}

As a result, a smaller group of Trustees appeared
sufficient.[¶](#section-4-3){.pilcrow}

In addition, the terms set for the Trustees selected from the IETF
community could be longer than the two-year period typical of other IETF
bodies.[¶](#section-4-4){.pilcrow}

One could have continued the practice of having the chairs and CEOs from
the IETF, IAB, and Internet Society be Trustees as well, but this may
not be necessary. In general, the tasks of the IETF Trust are well
defined, and while there is a need for coordination, it does not need to
be at the level of chairs or CEOs.[¶](#section-4-5){.pilcrow}

Given all this, one approach was to have Trustees appointed by the
NomCom, the IESG, and the ISOC Board of Trustees. (One might also have
considered the IETF Administration LLC legal entity instead of the
Internet Society for this role, but the Internet Society is perhaps more
suitable for the role given their focus on the broad use of the IETF
Trust assets and not merely administrative
aspects.)[¶](#section-4-6){.pilcrow}

If the same principles used for previous appointments continued to be
used, then appointments performed by the NomCom would need to be
confirmed by another entity. This could be, for instance, either the
IESG or the IAB. The IESG had previously been the confirming body for
the IAOC, so it has been retained in that role for the
Trustees.[¶](#section-4-7){.pilcrow}

## [5.](#section-5){.section-number .selfRef} [Transition](#name-transition){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-transition}

When the new entity for the IETF Administration LLC was set up, the IAOC
was expected to be discontinued soon thereafter. Fortunately, there was
no pressing need to change all the components of the IAOC and its
dependent organizations at the same time. As discussed in [Section
2](#background){.xref}, the IESG holds the ability to continue to name
Trustees. Once the updated procedures were in place, the IETF Trust had
its management nominated in the usual manner, and the IESG\'s exception
process was no longer needed.[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}
