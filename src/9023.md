Deterministic Networking (DetNet) is a service that can be offered by a
network to DetNet flows. DetNet provides these flows extremely low
packet-loss rates and assured maximum end-to-end delivery latency.
General background and concepts of DetNet can be found in the DetNet
Architecture \[[RFC8655](#RFC8655){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC8939](#RFC8939){.xref}\] specifies the DetNet data plane operation
for IP hosts and routers that provide DetNet service to IP-encapsulated
data. This document focuses on the scenario where DetNet IP nodes are
interconnected by a Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN)
sub-network.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

The DetNet Architecture decomposes the DetNet-related data plane
functions into two sub-layers: a service sub-layer and a forwarding
sub-layer. The service sub-layer is used to provide DetNet service
protection and reordering. The forwarding sub-layer is used to provide
congestion protection (low loss, assured latency, and limited
reordering). As described in \[[RFC8939](#RFC8939){.xref}\], no
DetNet-specific headers are added to support DetNet IP flows. So, only
the forwarding sub-layer functions can be supported inside the DetNet IP
domain. Service protection can be provided on a per-sub-network basis as
shown here for the IEEE 802.1 TSN sub-network
scenario.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC8939](#RFC8939){.xref}\] describes how IP is used by DetNet nodes,
i.e., hosts and routers, to identify DetNet flows and provide a DetNet
service. From a data plane perspective, an end-to-end IP model is
followed. DetNet uses flow identification based on a \"6-tuple\", where
\"6-tuple\" refers to information carried in IP- and higher-layer
protocol headers as defined in
\[[RFC8939](#RFC8939){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

DetNet flow aggregation may be enabled via the use of wildcards, masks,
prefixes, and ranges. IP tunnels may also be used to support flow
aggregation. In these cases, it is expected that DetNet-aware
intermediate nodes will provide DetNet service assurance on the
aggregate through resource allocation and congestion control
mechanisms.[¶](#section-3-2){.pilcrow}

Congestion protection, latency control, and the resource allocation
(queuing, policing, and shaping) are supported using the underlying link
/ sub-net-specific mechanisms. Service protections (packet-replication
and packet-elimination functions) are not provided at the IP DetNet
layer end to end due to the lack of unified end-to-end sequencing
information that would be available for intermediate nodes. However,
such service protection can be provided per underlying L2 link and per
sub-network.[¶](#section-3-3){.pilcrow}

DetNet routers ensure that DetNet service requirements are met per hop
by allocating local resources, by both receiving and transmitting, and
by mapping the service requirements of each flow to appropriate
sub-network mechanisms. Such mappings are sub-network technology
specific. DetNet nodes interconnected by a TSN sub-network are the
primary focus of this document. The mapping of DetNet IP flows to TSN
Streams and TSN protection mechanisms are covered in [Section
4](#mapping-tsn){.xref}.[¶](#section-3-4){.pilcrow}

This section covers how DetNet IP flows operate over an IEEE 802.1 TSN
sub-network. [Figure 1](#fig_ip_detnet_to_tsn){.xref} illustrates such a
scenario where two IP (DetNet) nodes are interconnected by a TSN
sub-network. Dotted lines around the Service components of the IP
(DetNet) nodes indicate that they are DetNet service aware but do not
perform any DetNet service sub-layer function. Node-1 is single homed
and Node-2 is dual homed to the TSN sub-network, and they are treated as
Talker or Listener inside the TSN sub-network. Note that from the TSN
perspective, dual-homed characteristics of Talker or Listener nodes are
transparent to the IP Layer.[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

:::

At the time of this writing, the Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) Task
Group of the IEEE 802.1 Working Group have defined (and are defining) a
number of amendments to \[[IEEE8021Q](#IEEE8021Q){.xref}\] that provide
zero congestion loss and bounded latency in bridged networks.
Furthermore, \[[IEEE8021CB](#IEEE8021CB){.xref}\] defines frame
replication and elimination functions for reliability that should prove
both compatible with and useful to DetNet networks. All these functions
have to identify flows that require TSN
treatment.[¶](#section-4-3){.pilcrow}

TSN capabilities of the TSN sub-network are made available for IP
(DetNet) flows via the protocol interworking function described in Annex
C.5 of \[[IEEE8021CB](#IEEE8021CB){.xref}\]. For example, applied on the
TSN edge port it can convert an ingress unicast IP (DetNet) flow to use
a specific L2 multicast destination Media Access Control (MAC) address
and a VLAN in order to forward the packet through a specific path inside
the bridged network. A similar interworking function pair at the other
end of the TSN sub-network would restore the packet to its original L2
destination MAC address and VLAN.[¶](#section-4-4){.pilcrow}

Placement of TSN functions depends on the TSN capabilities of nodes. IP
(DetNet) nodes may or may not support TSN functions. For a given TSN
Stream (i.e., a mapped DetNet flow), an IP (DetNet) node is treated as a
Talker or a Listener inside the TSN
sub-network.[¶](#section-4-5){.pilcrow}

### [4.1.](#section-4.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Functions for DetNet Flow to TSN Stream Mapping](#name-functions-for-detnet-flow-t){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-functions-for-detnet-flow-t}

Mapping of a DetNet IP flow to a TSN Stream is provided via the
combination of a passive and an active Stream identification function
that operate at the frame level (Layer 2). The passive Stream
identification function is used to catch the 6-tuple of a DetNet IP
flow, and the active Stream identification function is used to modify
the Ethernet header according to the ID of the mapped TSN
Stream.[¶](#section-4.1-1){.pilcrow}

Clause 6.7 of \[[IEEE8021CB](#IEEE8021CB){.xref}\] defines an IP Stream
identification function that can be used as a passive function for IP
DetNet flows using UDP or TCP. Clause 6.8 of
\[[IEEEP8021CBdb](#IEEEP8021CBdb){.xref}\] defines a Mask-and-Match
Stream identification function that can be used as a passive function
for any IP DetNet flows.[¶](#section-4.1-2){.pilcrow}

Clause 6.6 of \[[IEEE8021CB](#IEEE8021CB){.xref}\] defines an Active
Destination MAC and VLAN Stream identification function that can replace
some Ethernet header fields: (1) the destination MAC address, (2) the
VLAN-ID, and (3) priority parameters with alternate values. Replacement
is provided for the frame passed down the stack from the upper layers or
up the stack from the lower layers.[¶](#section-4.1-3){.pilcrow}

Active Destination MAC and VLAN Stream identification can be used within
a Talker to set flow identity or within a Listener to recover the
original addressing information. It can be used also in a TSN bridge
that is providing translation as a proxy service for an End
System.[¶](#section-4.1-4){.pilcrow}

This section covers the required behavior of a TSN-aware DetNet node
using a TSN sub-network. The implementation of TSN packet-processing
functions must be compliant with the relevant IEEE 802.1
standards.[¶](#section-4.2-1){.pilcrow}

From the TSN sub-network perspective, DetNet IP nodes are treated as a
Talker or Listener that may be (1) TSN unaware or (2) TSN
aware.[¶](#section-4.2-2){.pilcrow}

In cases of TSN-unaware IP DetNet nodes, the TSN relay nodes within the
TSN sub-network must modify the Ethernet encapsulation of the DetNet IP
flow (e.g., MAC translation, VLAN-ID setting, sequence number addition,
etc.) to allow proper TSN-specific handling inside the sub-network.
There are no requirements defined for TSN-unaware IP DetNet nodes in
this document.[¶](#section-4.2-3){.pilcrow}

IP (DetNet) nodes being TSN aware can be treated as a combination of a
TSN-unaware Talker/Listener and a TSN relay, as shown in [Figure
2](#fig_ip_with_tsn){.xref}. In such cases, the IP (DetNet) node must
provide the TSN sub-network-specific Ethernet encapsulation over the
link(s) towards the sub-network.[¶](#section-4.2-4){.pilcrow}

    \[[IEEEP8021CBcv](#IEEEP8021CBcv){.xref}\].[¶](#section-5-3.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-5-3.3}

This information must be provisioned per DetNet
flow.[¶](#section-5-4){.pilcrow}

Mappings between DetNet and TSN management and control planes are out of
scope of this document. Some of the challenges are highlighted
below.[¶](#section-5-5){.pilcrow}

TSN-aware IP DetNet nodes are members of both the DetNet domain and the
TSN sub-network. Within the TSN sub-network, the TSN-aware IP (DetNet)
node has a TSN-aware Talker/Listener role, so TSN-specific management
and control plane functionalities must be implemented. There are many
similarities in the management plane techniques used in DetNet and TSN,
but that is not the case for the control plane protocols. For example,
RSVP-TE and the Multiple Stream Registration Protocol (MSRP) of IEEE
802.1 behave differently. Therefore, management and control plane design
is an important aspect of scenarios where mapping between DetNet and TSN
is required.[¶](#section-5-6){.pilcrow}

In order to use a TSN sub-network between DetNet nodes, DetNet-specific
information must be converted to TSN sub-network-specific information.
DetNet flow ID and flow-related parameters/requirements must be
converted to a TSN Stream ID and stream-related parameters/requirements.
Note that, as the TSN sub-network is just a portion of the end-to-end
DetNet path (i.e., single hop from an IP perspective), some parameters
(e.g., delay) may differ significantly. Other parameters (like
bandwidth) also may have to be tuned due to the L2 encapsulation used
within the TSN sub-network.[¶](#section-5-7){.pilcrow}

In some cases, it may be challenging to determine some TSN
Stream-related information. For example, on a TSN-aware IP (DetNet) node
that acts as a Talker, it is quite obvious which DetNet node is the
Listener of the mapped TSN Stream (i.e., the IP next-hop). However, it
may not be trivial to locate the point/interface where that Listener is
connected to the TSN sub-network. Such attributes may require
interaction between control and management plane functions and between
DetNet and TSN domains.[¶](#section-5-8){.pilcrow}

Mapping between DetNet flow identifiers and TSN Stream identifiers, if
not provided explicitly, can be done by a TSN-aware IP (DetNet) node
locally based on information provided for configuration of the TSN
Stream identification functions (IP Stream identification,
Mask-and-Match Stream identification, and the active Stream
identification function).[¶](#section-5-9){.pilcrow}

Triggering the setup/modification of a TSN Stream in the TSN sub-network
is an example where management and/or control plane interactions are
required between the DetNet and TSN sub-network. TSN-unaware IP (DetNet)
nodes make such a triggering even more complicated, as they are fully
unaware of the sub-network and run
independently.[¶](#section-5-10){.pilcrow}

Configuration of TSN-specific functions (e.g., FRER) inside the TSN
sub-network is a TSN-domain-specific decision and may not be visible in
the DetNet domain.[¶](#section-5-11){.pilcrow}

## [6.](#section-6){.section-number .selfRef} [Security Considerations](#name-security-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-security-considerations}

Security considerations for DetNet are described in detail in
\[[DETNET-SECURITY](#I-D.ietf-detnet-security){.xref}\]. General
security considerations are described in \[[RFC8655](#RFC8655){.xref}\].
Considerations specific to the DetNet IP data plane are summarized in
\[[RFC8939](#RFC8939){.xref}\]. This section discusses security
considerations that are specific to the DetNet IP-over-TSN sub-network
scenario.[¶](#section-6-1){.pilcrow}

The sub-network between DetNet nodes needs to be subject to appropriate
confidentiality. Additionally, knowledge of what DetNet/TSN services are
provided by a sub-network may supply information that can be used in a
variety of security attacks. The ability to modify information exchanges
between connected DetNet nodes may result in bogus operations.
Therefore, it is important that the interface between DetNet nodes and
the TSN sub-network are subject to authorization, authentication, and
encryption.[¶](#section-6-2){.pilcrow}

The TSN sub-network operates at Layer 2, so various security mechanisms
defined by IEEE can be used to secure the connection between the DetNet
nodes (e.g., encryption may be provided using MACsec
