# QUIC: A UDP-Based Multiplexed and Secure Transport {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

This document defines the core of the QUIC transport protocol. QUIC
provides applications with flow-controlled streams for structured
communication, low-latency connection establishment, and network path
migration. QUIC includes security measures that ensure confidentiality,
integrity, and availability in a range of deployment circumstances.
Accompanying documents describe the integration of TLS for key
negotiation, loss detection, and an exemplary congestion control
algorithm.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

QUIC is a secure general-purpose transport protocol. This document
defines version 1 of QUIC, which conforms to the version-independent
properties of QUIC defined in
\[[QUIC-INVARIANTS](#QUIC-INVARIANTS){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

QUIC is a connection-oriented protocol that creates a stateful
interaction between a client and server.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

The QUIC handshake combines negotiation of cryptographic and transport
parameters. QUIC integrates the TLS handshake
\[[TLS13](#TLS13){.xref}\], although using a customized framing for
protecting packets. The integration of TLS and QUIC is described in more
detail in \[[QUIC-TLS](#QUIC-TLS){.xref}\]. The handshake is structured
to permit the exchange of application data as soon as possible. This
includes an option for clients to send data immediately (0-RTT), which
requires some form of prior communication or configuration to
enable.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

Endpoints communicate in QUIC by exchanging QUIC packets. Most packets
contain frames, which carry control information and application data
between endpoints. QUIC authenticates the entirety of each packet and
encrypts as much of each packet as is practical. QUIC packets are
carried in UDP datagrams \[[UDP](#UDP){.xref}\] to better facilitate
deployment in existing systems and networks.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

Application protocols exchange information over a QUIC connection via
streams, which are ordered sequences of bytes. Two types of streams can
be created: bidirectional streams, which allow both endpoints to send
data; and unidirectional streams, which allow a single endpoint to send
data. A credit-based scheme is used to limit stream creation and to
bound the amount of data that can be sent.[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}

QUIC provides the necessary feedback to implement reliable delivery and
congestion control. An algorithm for detecting and recovering from loss
of data is described in [Section
6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9002#section-6){.relref} of
\[[QUIC-RECOVERY](#QUIC-RECOVERY){.xref}\]. QUIC depends on congestion
control to avoid network congestion. An exemplary congestion control
algorithm is described in [Section
7](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9002#section-7){.relref} of
\[[QUIC-RECOVERY](#QUIC-RECOVERY){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-6){.pilcrow}

QUIC connections are not strictly bound to a single network path.
Connection migration uses connection identifiers to allow connections to
transfer to a new network path. Only clients are able to migrate in this
version of QUIC. This design also allows connections to continue after
changes in network topology or address mappings, such as might be caused
by NAT rebinding.[¶](#section-1-7){.pilcrow}

Once established, multiple options are provided for connection
termination. Applications can manage a graceful shutdown, endpoints can
negotiate a timeout period, errors can cause immediate connection
teardown, and a stateless mechanism provides for termination of
connections after one endpoint has lost
state.[¶](#section-1-8){.pilcrow}

When a single-bit field is referenced in prose, the position of that
field can be clarified by using the value of the byte that carries the
field with the field\'s value set. For example, the value 0x80 could be

Streams in QUIC provide a lightweight, ordered byte-stream abstraction
to an application. Streams can be unidirectional or
bidirectional.[¶](#section-2-1){.pilcrow}

Streams can be created by sending data. Other processes associated with
stream management \-- ending, canceling, and managing flow control \--
are all designed to impose minimal overheads. For instance, a single
STREAM frame ([Section 19.8](#frame-stream){.xref}) can open, carry data
for, and close a stream. Streams can also be long-lived and can last the
entire duration of a connection.[¶](#section-2-2){.pilcrow}

Streams can be created by either endpoint, can concurrently send data
interleaved with other streams, and can be canceled. QUIC does not
provide any means of ensuring ordering between bytes on different
streams.[¶](#section-2-3){.pilcrow}

QUIC allows for an arbitrary number of streams to operate concurrently
and for an arbitrary amount of data to be sent on any stream, subject to
flow control constraints and stream limits; see [Section
4](#flow-control){.xref}.[¶](#section-2-4){.pilcrow}

### [2.1.](#section-2.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Stream Types and Identifiers](#name-stream-types-and-identifier){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-stream-types-and-identifier}

Streams can be unidirectional or bidirectional. Unidirectional streams
carry data in one direction: from the initiator of the stream to its
peer. Bidirectional streams allow for data to be sent in both
directions.[¶](#section-2.1-1){.pilcrow}

Streams are identified within a connection by a numeric value, referred
to as the stream ID. A stream ID is a 62-bit integer (0 to 2^62^-1) that
is unique for all streams on a connection. Stream IDs are encoded as
variable-length integers; see [Section 16](#integer-encoding){.xref}. A
QUIC endpoint [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} reuse a stream ID within a
connection.[¶](#section-2.1-2){.pilcrow}

The least significant bit (0x01) of the stream ID identifies the
initiator of the stream. Client-initiated streams have even-numbered
stream IDs (with the bit set to 0), and server-initiated streams have
odd-numbered stream IDs (with the bit set to
1).[¶](#section-2.1-3){.pilcrow}

The second least significant bit (0x02) of the stream ID distinguishes
between bidirectional streams (with the bit set to 0) and unidirectional
streams (with the bit set to 1).[¶](#section-2.1-4){.pilcrow}

The two least significant bits from a stream ID therefore identify a
stream as one of four types, as summarized in [Table
1](#stream-id-types){.xref}.[¶](#section-2.1-5){.pilcrow}

The stream space for each type begins at the minimum value (0x00 through
0x03, respectively); successive streams of each type are created with
numerically increasing stream IDs. A stream ID that is used out of order
results in all streams of that type with lower-numbered stream IDs also
being opened.[¶](#section-2.1-7){.pilcrow}

STREAM frames ([Section 19.8](#frame-stream){.xref}) encapsulate data
sent by an application. An endpoint uses the Stream ID and Offset fields
in STREAM frames to place data in order.[¶](#section-2.2-1){.pilcrow}

Endpoints [MUST]{.bcp14} be able to deliver stream data to an
application as an ordered byte stream. Delivering an ordered byte stream
requires that an endpoint buffer any data that is received out of order,
up to the advertised flow control limit.[¶](#section-2.2-2){.pilcrow}

QUIC makes no specific allowances for delivery of stream data out of
order. However, implementations [MAY]{.bcp14} choose to offer the
ability to deliver data out of order to a receiving
application.[¶](#section-2.2-3){.pilcrow}

An endpoint could receive data for a stream at the same stream offset
multiple times. Data that has already been received can be discarded.
The data at a given offset [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} change if it is sent
multiple times; an endpoint [MAY]{.bcp14} treat receipt of different
data at the same offset within a stream as a connection error of type
PROTOCOL_VIOLATION.[¶](#section-2.2-4){.pilcrow}

Streams are an ordered byte-stream abstraction with no other structure
visible to QUIC. STREAM frame boundaries are not expected to be
preserved when data is transmitted, retransmitted after packet loss, or
delivered to the application at a receiver.[¶](#section-2.2-5){.pilcrow}

An endpoint [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} send data on any stream without ensuring
that it is within the flow control limits set by its peer. Flow control
is described in detail in [Section

An application protocol can also request to be informed of state changes

## [3.](#section-3){.section-number .selfRef} [Stream States](#name-stream-states){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-stream-states}

This section describes streams in terms of their send or receive
components. Two state machines are described: one for the streams on
which an endpoint transmits data ([Section
3.1](#stream-send-states){.xref}) and another for streams on which an
endpoint receives data ([Section
3.2](#stream-recv-states){.xref}).[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

Unidirectional streams use either the sending or receiving state
machine, depending on the stream type and endpoint role. Bidirectional
streams use both state machines at both endpoints. For the most part,
the use of these state machines is the same whether the stream is
unidirectional or bidirectional. The conditions for opening a stream are
slightly more complex for a bidirectional stream because the opening of
either the send or receive side causes the stream to open in both
directions.[¶](#section-3-2){.pilcrow}

The state machines shown in this section are largely informative. This
document uses stream states to describe rules for when and how different
types of frames can be sent and the reactions that are expected when
different types of frames are received. Though these state machines are
intended to be useful in implementing QUIC, these states are not
intended to constrain implementations. An implementation can define a
different state machine as long as its behavior is consistent with an
implementation that implements these states.[¶](#section-3-3){.pilcrow}

Note: In some cases, a single event or action can cause a transition
through multiple states. For instance, sending STREAM with a FIN bit set
can cause two state transitions for a sending stream: from the \"Ready\"
state to the \"Send\" state, and from the \"Send\" state to the \"Data
Sent\" state.[¶](#section-3-4.1){.pilcrow}

:::

The sending part of a stream that the endpoint initiates (types 0 and 2
for clients, 1 and 3 for servers) is opened by the application. The
\"Ready\" state represents a newly created stream that is able to accept
data from the application. Stream data might be buffered in this state
in preparation for sending.[¶](#section-3.1-3){.pilcrow}

Sending the first STREAM or STREAM_DATA_BLOCKED frame causes a sending
part of a stream to enter the \"Send\" state. An implementation might
choose to defer allocating a stream ID to a stream until it sends the
first STREAM frame and enters this state, which can allow for better
stream prioritization.[¶](#section-3.1-4){.pilcrow}

The sending part of a bidirectional stream initiated by a peer (type 0
for a server, type 1 for a client) starts in the \"Ready\" state when
the receiving part is created.[¶](#section-3.1-5){.pilcrow}

In the \"Send\" state, an endpoint transmits \-- and retransmits as
necessary \-- stream data in STREAM frames. The endpoint respects the
flow control limits set by its peer and continues to accept and process
MAX_STREAM_DATA frames. An endpoint in the \"Send\" state generates
STREAM_DATA_BLOCKED frames if it is blocked from sending by stream flow
control limits ([Section
4.1](#data-flow-control){.xref}).[¶](#section-3.1-6){.pilcrow}

After the application indicates that all stream data has been sent and a
STREAM frame containing the FIN bit is sent, the sending part of the
stream enters the \"Data Sent\" state. From this state, the endpoint
only retransmits stream data as necessary. The endpoint does not need to
check flow control limits or send STREAM_DATA_BLOCKED frames for a
stream in this state. MAX_STREAM_DATA frames might be received until the
peer receives the final stream offset. The endpoint can safely ignore
any MAX_STREAM_DATA frames it receives from its peer for a stream in
this state.[¶](#section-3.1-7){.pilcrow}

Once all stream data has been successfully acknowledged, the sending
part of the stream enters the \"Data Recvd\" state, which is a terminal
state.[¶](#section-3.1-8){.pilcrow}

From any state that is one of \"Ready\", \"Send\", or \"Data Sent\", an
application can signal that it wishes to abandon transmission of stream
data. Alternatively, an endpoint might receive a STOP_SENDING frame from
its peer. In either case, the endpoint sends a RESET_STREAM frame, which
causes the stream to enter the \"Reset Sent\"
state.[¶](#section-3.1-9){.pilcrow}

An endpoint [MAY]{.bcp14} send a RESET_STREAM as the first frame that
mentions a stream; this causes the sending part of that stream to open
and then immediately transition to the \"Reset Sent\"
state.[¶](#section-3.1-10){.pilcrow}

Once a packet containing a RESET_STREAM has been acknowledged, the

[Figure 3](#figure-3){.selfRef}: [States for Receiving Parts of
Streams](#name-states-for-receiving-parts-){.selfRef}
:::

The receiving part of a stream initiated by a peer (types 1 and 3 for a
client, or 0 and 2 for a server) is created when the first STREAM,
STREAM_DATA_BLOCKED, or RESET_STREAM frame is received for that stream.
For bidirectional streams initiated by a peer, receipt of a
MAX_STREAM_DATA or STOP_SENDING frame for the sending part of the stream
also creates the receiving part. The initial state for the receiving
part of a stream is \"Recv\".[¶](#section-3.2-3){.pilcrow}

For a bidirectional stream, the receiving part enters the \"Recv\" state
when the sending part initiated by the endpoint (type 0 for a client,
type 1 for a server) enters the \"Ready\"
state.[¶](#section-3.2-4){.pilcrow}

An endpoint opens a bidirectional stream when a MAX_STREAM_DATA or
STOP_SENDING frame is received from the peer for that stream. Receiving
a MAX_STREAM_DATA frame for an unopened stream indicates that the remote
peer has opened the stream and is providing flow control credit.
Receiving a STOP_SENDING frame for an unopened stream indicates that the
remote peer no longer wishes to receive data on this stream. Either
frame might arrive before a STREAM or STREAM_DATA_BLOCKED frame if
packets are lost or reordered.[¶](#section-3.2-5){.pilcrow}

Before a stream is created, all streams of the same type with
lower-numbered stream IDs [MUST]{.bcp14} be created. This ensures that
the creation order for streams is consistent on both
endpoints.[¶](#section-3.2-6){.pilcrow}

In the \"Recv\" state, the endpoint receives STREAM and
STREAM_DATA_BLOCKED frames. Incoming data is buffered and can be
reassembled into the correct order for delivery to the application. As
data is consumed by the application and buffer space becomes available,
the endpoint sends MAX_STREAM_DATA frames to allow the peer to send more
data.[¶](#section-3.2-7){.pilcrow}

When a STREAM frame with a FIN bit is received, the final size of the
stream is known; see [Section 4.5](#final-size){.xref}. The receiving
part of the stream then enters the \"Size Known\" state. In this state,
the endpoint no longer needs to send MAX_STREAM_DATA frames; it only
receives any retransmissions of stream
data.[¶](#section-3.2-8){.pilcrow}

Once all data for the stream has been received, the receiving part
enters the \"Data Recvd\" state. This might happen as a result of
receiving the same STREAM frame that causes the transition to \"Size
Known\". After all data has been received, any STREAM or
STREAM_DATA_BLOCKED frames for the stream can be
discarded.[¶](#section-3.2-9){.pilcrow}

The \"Data Recvd\" state persists until stream data has been delivered
to the application. Once stream data has been delivered, the stream
enters the \"Data Read\" state, which is a terminal
state.[¶](#section-3.2-10){.pilcrow}

Receiving a RESET_STREAM frame in the \"Recv\" or \"Size Known\" state
causes the stream to enter the \"Reset Recvd\" state. This might cause
the delivery of stream data to the application to be
interrupted.[¶](#section-3.2-11){.pilcrow}

It is possible that all stream data has already been received when a
RESET_STREAM is received (that is, in the \"Data Recvd\" state).
Similarly, it is possible for remaining stream data to arrive after
receiving a RESET_STREAM frame (the \"Reset Recvd\" state). An
implementation is free to manage this situation as it
chooses.[¶](#section-3.2-12){.pilcrow}

Sending a RESET_STREAM means that an endpoint cannot guarantee delivery
of stream data; however, there is no requirement that stream data not be
delivered if a RESET_STREAM is received. An implementation [MAY]{.bcp14}
interrupt delivery of stream data, discard any data that was not
consumed, and signal the receipt of the RESET_STREAM. A RESET_STREAM
signal might be suppressed or withheld if stream data is completely
received and is buffered to be read by the application. If the
RESET_STREAM is suppressed, the receiving part of the stream remains in
\"Data Recvd\".[¶](#section-3.2-13){.pilcrow}

Once the application receives the signal indicating that the stream was
reset, the receiving part of the stream transitions to the \"Reset
Read\" state, which is a terminal state.[¶](#section-3.2-14){.pilcrow}

19.13](#frame-stream-data-blocked){.xref}), and RESET_STREAM ([Section

A sender [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} send any of these frames from a terminal
state (\"Data Recvd\" or \"Reset Recvd\"). A sender [MUST NOT]{.bcp14}
send a STREAM or STREAM_DATA_BLOCKED frame for a stream in the \"Reset
Sent\" state or any terminal state \-- that is, after sending a
RESET_STREAM frame. A receiver could receive any of these three frames
in any state, due to the possibility of delayed delivery of packets
carrying them.[¶](#section-3.3-2){.pilcrow}

The receiver of a stream sends MAX_STREAM_DATA frames ([Section

receiver [MAY]{.bcp14} send a STOP_SENDING frame in any state where it

\"Reset Recvd\" or \"Reset Read\". However, there is little value in
sending a STOP_SENDING frame in the \"Data Recvd\" state, as all stream
data has been received. A sender could receive either of these two types
of frames in any state as a result of delayed delivery of
packets.[¶](#section-3.3-4){.pilcrow}

A bidirectional stream is composed of sending and receiving parts.
Implementations can represent states of the bidirectional stream as
composites of sending and receiving stream states. The simplest model
presents the stream as \"open\" when either sending or receiving parts
are in a non-terminal state and \"closed\" when both sending and
receiving streams are in terminal states.[¶](#section-3.4-1){.pilcrow}

[Table 2](#stream-bidi-mapping){.xref} shows a more complex mapping of
bidirectional stream states that loosely correspond to the stream states

If an application is no longer interested in the data it is receiving on
a stream, it can abort reading the stream and specify an application
error code.[¶](#section-3.5-1){.pilcrow}

If the stream is in the \"Recv\" or \"Size Known\" state, the transport
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} signal this by sending a STOP_SENDING frame to prompt
closure of the stream in the opposite direction. This typically
indicates that the receiving application is no longer reading data it
receives from the stream, but it is not a guarantee that incoming data
will be ignored.[¶](#section-3.5-2){.pilcrow}

STREAM frames received after sending a STOP_SENDING frame are still
counted toward connection and stream flow control, even though these
frames can be discarded upon receipt.[¶](#section-3.5-3){.pilcrow}

A STOP_SENDING frame requests that the receiving endpoint send a
RESET_STREAM frame. An endpoint that receives a STOP_SENDING frame
[MUST]{.bcp14} send a RESET_STREAM frame if the stream is in the
\"Ready\" or \"Send\" state. If the stream is in the \"Data Sent\"
state, the endpoint [MAY]{.bcp14} defer sending the RESET_STREAM frame
until the packets containing outstanding data are acknowledged or
declared lost. If any outstanding data is declared lost, the endpoint
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} send a RESET_STREAM frame instead of retransmitting the
data.[¶](#section-3.5-4){.pilcrow}

An endpoint [SHOULD]{.bcp14} copy the error code from the STOP_SENDING
frame to the RESET_STREAM frame it sends, but it can use any application
error code. An endpoint that sends a STOP_SENDING frame [MAY]{.bcp14}
ignore the error code in any RESET_STREAM frames subsequently received
for that stream.[¶](#section-3.5-5){.pilcrow}

STOP_SENDING [SHOULD]{.bcp14} only be sent for a stream that has not
been reset by the peer. STOP_SENDING is most useful for streams in the
\"Recv\" or \"Size Known\" state.[¶](#section-3.5-6){.pilcrow}

An endpoint is expected to send another STOP_SENDING frame if a packet
containing a previous STOP_SENDING is lost. However, once either all
stream data or a RESET_STREAM frame has been received for the stream \--
that is, the stream is in any state other than \"Recv\" or \"Size
Known\" \-- sending a STOP_SENDING frame is
unnecessary.[¶](#section-3.5-7){.pilcrow}

An endpoint that wishes to terminate both directions of a bidirectional
stream can terminate one direction by sending a RESET_STREAM frame, and
it can encourage prompt termination in the opposite direction by sending
a STOP_SENDING frame.[¶](#section-3.5-8){.pilcrow}

## [4.](#section-4){.section-number .selfRef} [Flow Control](#name-flow-control){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-flow-control}

Receivers need to limit the amount of data that they are required to
buffer, in order to prevent a fast sender from overwhelming them or a
malicious sender from consuming a large amount of memory. To enable a
receiver to limit memory commitments for a connection, streams are flow
controlled both individually and across a connection as a whole. A QUIC
receiver controls the maximum amount of data the sender can send on a
stream as well as across all streams at any time, as described in
Sections [4.1](#data-flow-control){.xref} and
[4.2](#fc-credit){.xref}.[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

Similarly, to limit concurrency within a connection, a QUIC endpoint
controls the maximum cumulative number of streams that its peer can
initiate, as described in [Section
4.6](#controlling-concurrency){.xref}.[¶](#section-4-2){.pilcrow}

Data sent in CRYPTO frames is not flow controlled in the same way as
stream data. QUIC relies on the cryptographic protocol implementation to
avoid excessive buffering of data; see \[[QUIC-TLS](#QUIC-TLS){.xref}\].
To avoid excessive buffering at multiple layers, QUIC implementations
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} provide an interface for the cryptographic protocol
implementation to communicate its buffering
limits.[¶](#section-4-3){.pilcrow}

### [4.1.](#section-4.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Data Flow Control](#name-data-flow-control){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-data-flow-control}

QUIC employs a limit-based flow control scheme where a receiver
advertises the limit of total bytes it is prepared to receive on a given
stream or for the entire connection. This leads to two levels of data
flow control in QUIC:[¶](#section-4.1-1){.pilcrow}

-   [Stream flow control, which prevents a single stream from consuming
    the entire receive buffer for a connection by limiting the amount of
    data that can be sent on each
    stream.[¶](#section-4.1-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.1-2.1}
-   [Connection flow control, which prevents senders from exceeding a
    receiver\'s buffer capacity for the connection by limiting the total
    bytes of stream data sent in STREAM frames on all
    streams.[¶](#section-4.1-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.1-2.2}

Senders [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} send data in excess of either
limit.[¶](#section-4.1-3){.pilcrow}

A receiver sets initial limits for all streams through transport
parameters during the handshake ([Section
7.4](#transport-parameters){.xref}). Subsequently, a receiver sends
MAX_STREAM_DATA frames ([Section 19.10](#frame-max-stream-data){.xref})
or MAX_DATA frames ([Section 19.9](#frame-max-data){.xref}) to the
sender to advertise larger limits.[¶](#section-4.1-4){.pilcrow}

A receiver can advertise a larger limit for a stream by sending a
MAX_STREAM_DATA frame with the corresponding stream ID. A
MAX_STREAM_DATA frame indicates the maximum absolute byte offset of a
stream. A receiver could determine the flow control offset to be
advertised based on the current offset of data consumed on that
stream.[¶](#section-4.1-5){.pilcrow}

A receiver can advertise a larger limit for a connection by sending a
MAX_DATA frame, which indicates the maximum of the sum of the absolute
byte offsets of all streams. A receiver maintains a cumulative sum of
bytes received on all streams, which is used to check for violations of
the advertised connection or stream data limits. A receiver could
determine the maximum data limit to be advertised based on the sum of
bytes consumed on all streams.[¶](#section-4.1-6){.pilcrow}

Once a receiver advertises a limit for the connection or a stream, it is
not an error to advertise a smaller limit, but the smaller limit has no
effect.[¶](#section-4.1-7){.pilcrow}

A receiver [MUST]{.bcp14} close the connection with an error of type
FLOW_CONTROL_ERROR if the sender violates the advertised connection or
stream data limits; see [Section 11](#error-handling){.xref} for details
on error handling.[¶](#section-4.1-8){.pilcrow}

A sender [MUST]{.bcp14} ignore any MAX_STREAM_DATA or MAX_DATA frames
that do not increase flow control limits.[¶](#section-4.1-9){.pilcrow}

If a sender has sent data up to the limit, it will be unable to send new
data and is considered blocked. A sender [SHOULD]{.bcp14} send a
STREAM_DATA_BLOCKED or DATA_BLOCKED frame to indicate to the receiver
that it has data to write but is blocked by flow control limits. If a
sender is blocked for a period longer than the idle timeout ([Section
10.1](#idle-timeout){.xref}), the receiver might close the connection
even when the sender has data that is available for transmission. To
keep the connection from closing, a sender that is flow control limited
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} periodically send a STREAM_DATA_BLOCKED or DATA_BLOCKED
frame when it has no ack-eliciting packets in
flight.[¶](#section-4.1-10){.pilcrow}

### [4.2.](#section-4.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Increasing Flow Control Limits](#name-increasing-flow-control-lim){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-increasing-flow-control-lim}

Implementations decide when and how much credit to advertise in
MAX_STREAM_DATA and MAX_DATA frames, but this section offers a few
considerations.[¶](#section-4.2-1){.pilcrow}

To avoid blocking a sender, a receiver [MAY]{.bcp14} send a
MAX_STREAM_DATA or MAX_DATA frame multiple times within a round trip or
send it early enough to allow time for loss of the frame and subsequent
recovery.[¶](#section-4.2-2){.pilcrow}

Control frames contribute to connection overhead. Therefore, frequently
sending MAX_STREAM_DATA and MAX_DATA frames with small changes is
undesirable. On the other hand, if updates are less frequent, larger
increments to limits are necessary to avoid blocking a sender, requiring
larger resource commitments at the receiver. There is a trade-off
between resource commitment and overhead when determining how large a
limit is advertised.[¶](#section-4.2-3){.pilcrow}

A receiver can use an autotuning mechanism to tune the frequency and
amount of advertised additional credit based on a round-trip time
estimate and the rate at which the receiving application consumes data,
similar to common TCP implementations. As an optimization, an endpoint
could send frames related to flow control only when there are other
frames to send, ensuring that flow control does not cause extra packets
to be sent.[¶](#section-4.2-4){.pilcrow}

A blocked sender is not required to send STREAM_DATA_BLOCKED or
DATA_BLOCKED frames. Therefore, a receiver [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} wait for a
STREAM_DATA_BLOCKED or DATA_BLOCKED frame before sending a
MAX_STREAM_DATA or MAX_DATA frame; doing so could result in the sender
being blocked for the rest of the connection. Even if the sender sends
these frames, waiting for them will result in the sender being blocked
for at least an entire round trip.[¶](#section-4.2-5){.pilcrow}

When a sender receives credit after being blocked, it might be able to
send a large amount of data in response, resulting in short-term
congestion; see [Section
7.7](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9002#section-7.7){.relref} of

control credit that is greater than the peer\'s bandwidth-delay product
on this connection, its receive throughput will be limited by flow
control.[¶](#section-4.3-1){.pilcrow}

space.[¶](#section-4.3-2){.pilcrow}

Sending timely updates of flow control limits can improve performance.

that has been consumed on every stream, to be able to account for all
bytes for connection-level flow control.[¶](#section-4.4-1){.pilcrow}

On receipt of a RESET_STREAM frame, an endpoint will tear down state for
the matching stream and ignore further data arriving on that
stream.[¶](#section-4.4-2){.pilcrow}

RESET_STREAM terminates one direction of a stream abruptly. For a
bidirectional stream, RESET_STREAM has no effect on data flow in the
opposite direction. Both endpoints [MUST]{.bcp14} maintain flow control
state for the stream in the unterminated direction until that direction
enters a terminal state.[¶](#section-4.4-3){.pilcrow}

### [4.5.](#section-4.5){.section-number .selfRef} [Stream Final Size](#name-stream-final-size){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-stream-final-size}

The final size is the amount of flow control credit that is consumed by
a stream. Assuming that every contiguous byte on the stream was sent
once, the final size is the number of bytes sent. More generally, this
is one higher than the offset of the byte with the largest offset sent
on the stream, or zero if no bytes were
sent.[¶](#section-4.5-1){.pilcrow}

A sender always communicates the final size of a stream to the receiver
reliably, no matter how the stream is terminated. The final size is the
sum of the Offset and Length fields of a STREAM frame with a FIN flag,
noting that these fields might be implicit. Alternatively, the Final
Size field of a RESET_STREAM frame carries this value. This guarantees
that both endpoints agree on how much flow control credit was consumed
by the sender on that stream.[¶](#section-4.5-2){.pilcrow}

An endpoint will know the final size for a stream when the receiving
part of the stream enters the \"Size Known\" or \"Reset Recvd\" state
([Section 3](#stream-states){.xref}). The receiver [MUST]{.bcp14} use
the final size of the stream to account for all bytes sent on the stream
in its connection-level flow controller.[¶](#section-4.5-3){.pilcrow}

An endpoint [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} send data on a stream at or beyond the
final size.[¶](#section-4.5-4){.pilcrow}

Once a final size for a stream is known, it cannot change. If a
RESET_STREAM or STREAM frame is received indicating a change in the
final size for the stream, an endpoint [SHOULD]{.bcp14} respond with an
error of type FINAL_SIZE_ERROR; see [Section 11](#error-handling){.xref}
for details on error handling. A receiver [SHOULD]{.bcp14} treat receipt
of data at or beyond the final size as an error of type
FINAL_SIZE_ERROR, even after a stream is closed. Generating these errors
is not mandatory, because requiring that an endpoint generate these
errors also means that the endpoint needs to maintain the final size
state for closed streams, which could mean a significant state
commitment.[¶](#section-4.5-5){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-4.6 .section}
### [4.6.](#section-4.6){.section-number .selfRef} [Controlling Concurrency](#name-controlling-concurrency){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-controlling-concurrency}

An endpoint limits the cumulative number of incoming streams a peer can
open. Only streams with a stream ID less than
`(max_streams * 4 + first_stream_id_of_type)` can be opened; see [Table
1](#stream-id-types){.xref}. Initial limits are set in the transport
parameters; see [Section 18.2](#transport-parameter-definitions){.xref}.
Subsequent limits are advertised using MAX_STREAMS frames; see [Section
19.11](#frame-max-streams){.xref}. Separate limits apply to
unidirectional and bidirectional streams.[¶](#section-4.6-1){.pilcrow}

If a max_streams transport parameter or a MAX_STREAMS frame is received
with a value greater than 2^60^, this would allow a maximum stream ID
that cannot be expressed as a variable-length integer; see [Section
16](#integer-encoding){.xref}. If either is received, the connection
[MUST]{.bcp14} be closed immediately with a connection error of type
TRANSPORT_PARAMETER_ERROR if the offending value was received in a
transport parameter or of type FRAME_ENCODING_ERROR if it was received
in a frame; see [Section
10.2](#immediate-close){.xref}.[¶](#section-4.6-2){.pilcrow}

Endpoints [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} exceed the limit set by their peer. An
endpoint that receives a frame with a stream ID exceeding the limit it
has sent [MUST]{.bcp14} treat this as a connection error of type
STREAM_LIMIT_ERROR; see [Section 11](#error-handling){.xref} for details
on error handling.[¶](#section-4.6-3){.pilcrow}

Once a receiver advertises a stream limit using the MAX_STREAMS frame,
advertising a smaller limit has no effect. MAX_STREAMS frames that do
not increase the stream limit [MUST]{.bcp14} be
ignored.[¶](#section-4.6-4){.pilcrow}

As with stream and connection flow control, this document leaves
implementations to decide when and how many streams should be advertised
to a peer via MAX_STREAMS. Implementations might choose to increase
limits as streams are closed, to keep the number of streams available to
peers roughly consistent.[¶](#section-4.6-5){.pilcrow}

An endpoint that is unable to open a new stream due to the peer\'s
limits [SHOULD]{.bcp14} send a STREAMS_BLOCKED frame ([Section
19.14](#frame-streams-blocked){.xref}). This signal is considered useful
for debugging. An endpoint [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} wait to receive this
signal before advertising additional credit, since doing so will mean
that the peer will be blocked for at least an entire round trip, and
potentially indefinitely if the peer chooses not to send STREAMS_BLOCKED
frames.[¶](#section-4.6-6){.pilcrow}

A QUIC connection is shared state between a client and a
server.[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

Each connection starts with a handshake phase, during which the two
endpoints establish a shared secret using the cryptographic handshake
protocol \[[QUIC-TLS](#QUIC-TLS){.xref}\] and negotiate the application
protocol. The handshake ([Section 7](#handshake){.xref}) confirms that
both endpoints are willing to communicate ([Section
8.1](#validate-handshake){.xref}) and establishes parameters for the
connection ([Section
7.4](#transport-parameters){.xref}).[¶](#section-5-2){.pilcrow}

An application protocol can use the connection during the handshake
phase with some limitations. 0-RTT allows application data to be sent by
a client before receiving a response from the server. However, 0-RTT
provides no protection against replay attacks; see [Section
9.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9001#section-9.2){.relref} of
\[[QUIC-TLS](#QUIC-TLS){.xref}\]. A server can also send application
data to a client before it receives the final cryptographic handshake
messages that allow it to confirm the identity and liveness of the
client. These capabilities allow an application protocol to offer the
option of trading some security guarantees for reduced
latency.[¶](#section-5-3){.pilcrow}

The use of connection IDs ([Section 5.1](#connection-id){.xref}) allows
connections to migrate to a new network path, both as a direct choice of
an endpoint and when forced by a change in a middlebox. [Section
9](#migration){.xref} describes mitigations for the security and privacy
issues associated with migration.[¶](#section-5-4){.pilcrow}

For connections that are no longer needed or desired, there are several
ways for a client and server to terminate a connection, as described in
[Section 10](#termination){.xref}.[¶](#section-5-5){.pilcrow}

::: {#connection-id}
::: {#section-5.1 .section}
### [5.1.](#section-5.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Connection ID](#name-connection-id){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-connection-id}

Each connection possesses a set of connection identifiers, or connection
IDs, each of which can identify the connection. Connection IDs are
independently selected by endpoints; each endpoint selects the
connection IDs that its peer uses.[¶](#section-5.1-1){.pilcrow}

The primary function of a connection ID is to ensure that changes in
addressing at lower protocol layers (UDP, IP) do not cause packets for a
QUIC connection to be delivered to the wrong endpoint. Each endpoint
selects connection IDs using an implementation-specific (and perhaps
deployment-specific) method that will allow packets with that connection
ID to be routed back to the endpoint and to be identified by the
endpoint upon receipt.[¶](#section-5.1-2){.pilcrow}

Multiple connection IDs are used so that endpoints can send packets that
cannot be identified by an observer as being for the same connection
without cooperation from an endpoint; see [Section
9.5](#migration-linkability){.xref}.[¶](#section-5.1-3){.pilcrow}

Connection IDs [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} contain any information that can be
used by an external observer (that is, one that does not cooperate with
the issuer) to correlate them with other connection IDs for the same
connection. As a trivial example, this means the same connection ID
[MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be issued more than once on the same
connection.[¶](#section-5.1-4){.pilcrow}

Packets with long headers include Source Connection ID and Destination
Connection ID fields. These fields are used to set the connection IDs
for new connections; see [Section
7.2](#negotiating-connection-ids){.xref} for
details.[¶](#section-5.1-5){.pilcrow}

Packets with short headers ([Section 17.3](#short-header){.xref}) only
include the Destination Connection ID and omit the explicit length. The
length of the Destination Connection ID field is expected to be known to
endpoints. Endpoints using a load balancer that routes based on
connection ID could agree with the load balancer on a fixed length for
connection IDs or agree on an encoding scheme. A fixed portion could
encode an explicit length, which allows the entire connection ID to vary
in length and still be used by the load
balancer.[¶](#section-5.1-6){.pilcrow}

A Version Negotiation ([Section 17.2.1](#packet-version){.xref}) packet
echoes the connection IDs selected by the client, both to ensure correct
routing toward the client and to demonstrate that the packet is in
response to a packet sent by the client.[¶](#section-5.1-7){.pilcrow}

A zero-length connection ID can be used when a connection ID is not
needed to route to the correct endpoint. However, multiplexing
connections on the same local IP address and port while using
zero-length connection IDs will cause failures in the presence of peer
connection migration, NAT rebinding, and client port reuse. An endpoint
[MUST NOT]{.bcp14} use the same IP address and port for multiple
concurrent connections with zero-length connection IDs, unless it is
certain that those protocol features are not in
use.[¶](#section-5.1-8){.pilcrow}

When an endpoint uses a non-zero-length connection ID, it needs to
ensure that the peer has a supply of connection IDs from which to choose
for packets sent to the endpoint. These connection IDs are supplied by
the endpoint using the NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame ([Section
19.15](#frame-new-connection-id){.xref}).[¶](#section-5.1-9){.pilcrow}

::: {#issue-cid}

#### [5.1.1.](#section-5.1.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Issuing Connection IDs](#name-issuing-connection-ids){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-issuing-connection-ids}

Each connection ID has an associated sequence number to assist in
detecting when NEW_CONNECTION_ID or RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frames refer to
the same value. The initial connection ID issued by an endpoint is sent
in the Source Connection ID field of the long packet header ([Section
17.2](#long-header){.xref}) during the handshake. The sequence number of
the initial connection ID is 0. If the preferred_address transport
parameter is sent, the sequence number of the supplied connection ID is
1.[¶](#section-5.1.1-1){.pilcrow}

Additional connection IDs are communicated to the peer using
NEW_CONNECTION_ID frames ([Section
19.15](#frame-new-connection-id){.xref}). The sequence number on each
newly issued connection ID [MUST]{.bcp14} increase by 1. The connection
ID that a client selects for the first Destination Connection ID field
it sends and any connection ID provided by a Retry packet are not
assigned sequence numbers.[¶](#section-5.1.1-2){.pilcrow}

When an endpoint issues a connection ID, it [MUST]{.bcp14} accept
packets that carry this connection ID for the duration of the connection
or until its peer invalidates the connection ID via a
RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frame ([Section
19.16](#frame-retire-connection-id){.xref}). Connection IDs that are
issued and not retired are considered active; any active connection ID
is valid for use with the current connection at any time, in any packet
type. This includes the connection ID issued by the server via the
preferred_address transport parameter.[¶](#section-5.1.1-3){.pilcrow}

An endpoint [SHOULD]{.bcp14} ensure that its peer has a sufficient
number of available and unused connection IDs. Endpoints advertise the
number of active connection IDs they are willing to maintain using the
active_connection_id_limit transport parameter. An endpoint [MUST
NOT]{.bcp14} provide more connection IDs than the peer\'s limit. An
endpoint [MAY]{.bcp14} send connection IDs that temporarily exceed a
peer\'s limit if the NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame also requires the
retirement of any excess, by including a sufficiently large value in the
Retire Prior To field.[¶](#section-5.1.1-4){.pilcrow}

A NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame might cause an endpoint to add some active
connection IDs and retire others based on the value of the Retire Prior
To field. After processing a NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame and adding and
retiring active connection IDs, if the number of active connection IDs
exceeds the value advertised in its active_connection_id_limit transport
parameter, an endpoint [MUST]{.bcp14} close the connection with an error
of type CONNECTION_ID_LIMIT_ERROR.[¶](#section-5.1.1-5){.pilcrow}

An endpoint [SHOULD]{.bcp14} supply a new connection ID when the peer
retires a connection ID. If an endpoint provided fewer connection IDs
than the peer\'s active_connection_id_limit, it [MAY]{.bcp14} supply a
new connection ID when it receives a packet with a previously unused
connection ID. An endpoint [MAY]{.bcp14} limit the total number of
connection IDs issued for each connection to avoid the risk of running
out of connection IDs; see [Section 10.3.2](#reset-token){.xref}. An
endpoint [MAY]{.bcp14} also limit the issuance of connection IDs to
reduce the amount of per-path state it maintains, such as path
validation status, as its peer might interact with it over as many paths
as there are issued connection IDs.[¶](#section-5.1.1-6){.pilcrow}

An endpoint that initiates migration and requires non-zero-length
connection IDs [SHOULD]{.bcp14} ensure that the pool of connection IDs
available to its peer allows the peer to use a new connection ID on
migration, as the peer will be unable to respond if the pool is
exhausted.[¶](#section-5.1.1-7){.pilcrow}

An endpoint that selects a zero-length connection ID during the
handshake cannot issue a new connection ID. A zero-length Destination
Connection ID field is used in all packets sent toward such an endpoint
over any network path.[¶](#section-5.1.1-8){.pilcrow}

An endpoint can change the connection ID it uses for a peer to another
available one at any time during the connection. An endpoint consumes
connection IDs in response to a migrating peer; see [Section
9.5](#migration-linkability){.xref} for more
details.[¶](#section-5.1.2-1){.pilcrow}

An endpoint maintains a set of connection IDs received from its peer,
any of which it can use when sending packets. When the endpoint wishes
to remove a connection ID from use, it sends a RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID
frame to its peer. Sending a RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frame indicates that
the connection ID will not be used again and requests that the peer
replace it with a new connection ID using a NEW_CONNECTION_ID
frame.[¶](#section-5.1.2-2){.pilcrow}

As discussed in [Section 9.5](#migration-linkability){.xref}, endpoints
limit the use of a connection ID to packets sent from a single local
address to a single destination address. Endpoints [SHOULD]{.bcp14}
retire connection IDs when they are no longer actively using either the
local or destination address for which the connection ID was
used.[¶](#section-5.1.2-3){.pilcrow}

An endpoint might need to stop accepting previously issued connection
IDs in certain circumstances. Such an endpoint can cause its peer to
retire connection IDs by sending a NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame with an
increased Retire Prior To field. The endpoint [SHOULD]{.bcp14} continue
to accept the previously issued connection IDs until they are retired by
the peer. If the endpoint can no longer process the indicated connection
IDs, it [MAY]{.bcp14} close the
connection.[¶](#section-5.1.2-4){.pilcrow}

Upon receipt of an increased Retire Prior To field, the peer
[MUST]{.bcp14} stop using the corresponding connection IDs and retire
them with RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frames before adding the newly provided
connection ID to the set of active connection IDs. This ordering allows
an endpoint to replace all active connection IDs without the possibility
of a peer having no available connection IDs and without exceeding the
limit the peer sets in the active_connection_id_limit transport
parameter; see [Section 18.2](#transport-parameter-definitions){.xref}.
Failure to cease using the connection IDs when requested can result in
connection failures, as the issuing endpoint might be unable to continue
using the connection IDs with the active
connection.[¶](#section-5.1.2-5){.pilcrow}

An endpoint [SHOULD]{.bcp14} limit the number of connection IDs it has
retired locally for which RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frames have not yet been
acknowledged. An endpoint [SHOULD]{.bcp14} allow for sending and
tracking a number of RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frames of at least twice the
value of the active_connection_id_limit transport parameter. An endpoint
[MUST NOT]{.bcp14} forget a connection ID without retiring it, though it
[MAY]{.bcp14} choose to treat having connection IDs in need of
retirement that exceed this limit as a connection error of type
CONNECTION_ID_LIMIT_ERROR.[¶](#section-5.1.2-6){.pilcrow}

Endpoints [SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} issue updates of the Retire Prior To
field before receiving RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frames that retire all
connection IDs indicated by the previous Retire Prior To
value.[¶](#section-5.1.2-7){.pilcrow}

### [5.2.](#section-5.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Matching Packets to Connections](#name-matching-packets-to-connect){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-matching-packets-to-connect}

Incoming packets are classified on receipt. Packets can either be
associated with an existing connection or \-- for servers \--
potentially create a new connection.[¶](#section-5.2-1){.pilcrow}

Endpoints try to associate a packet with an existing connection. If the
packet has a non-zero-length Destination Connection ID corresponding to
an existing connection, QUIC processes that packet accordingly. Note
that more than one connection ID can be associated with a connection;
see [Section 5.1](#connection-id){.xref}.[¶](#section-5.2-2){.pilcrow}

If the Destination Connection ID is zero length and the addressing
information in the packet matches the addressing information the
endpoint uses to identify a connection with a zero-length connection ID,
QUIC processes the packet as part of that connection. An endpoint can
use just destination IP and port or both source and destination
addresses for identification, though this makes connections fragile as
described in [Section
5.1](#connection-id){.xref}.[¶](#section-5.2-3){.pilcrow}

Endpoints can send a Stateless Reset ([Section
10.3](#stateless-reset){.xref}) for any packets that cannot be
attributed to an existing connection. A Stateless Reset allows a peer to
more quickly identify when a connection becomes
unusable.[¶](#section-5.2-4){.pilcrow}

Packets that are matched to an existing connection are discarded if the
packets are inconsistent with the state of that connection. For example,
packets are discarded if they indicate a different protocol version than
that of the connection or if the removal of packet protection is
unsuccessful once the expected keys are
available.[¶](#section-5.2-5){.pilcrow}

Invalid packets that lack strong integrity protection, such as Initial,
Retry, or Version Negotiation, [MAY]{.bcp14} be discarded. An endpoint
[MUST]{.bcp14} generate a connection error if processing the contents of
these packets prior to discovering an error, or fully revert any changes
made during that processing.[¶](#section-5.2-6){.pilcrow}

#### [5.2.1.](#section-5.2.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Client Packet Handling](#name-client-packet-handling){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-client-packet-handling}

Valid packets sent to clients always include a Destination Connection ID
that matches a value the client selects. Clients that choose to receive
zero-length connection IDs can use the local address and port to
identify a connection. Packets that do not match an existing connection
\-- based on Destination Connection ID or, if this value is zero length,
local IP address and port \-- are
discarded.[¶](#section-5.2.1-1){.pilcrow}

Due to packet reordering or loss, a client might receive packets for a
connection that are encrypted with a key it has not yet computed. The
client [MAY]{.bcp14} drop these packets, or it [MAY]{.bcp14} buffer them
in anticipation of later packets that allow it to compute the
key.[¶](#section-5.2.1-2){.pilcrow}

If a client receives a packet that uses a different version than it
initially selected, it [MUST]{.bcp14} discard that
packet.[¶](#section-5.2.1-3){.pilcrow}

If a server receives a packet that indicates an unsupported version and
if the packet is large enough to initiate a new connection for any
supported version, the server [SHOULD]{.bcp14} send a Version
Negotiation packet as described in [Section 6.1](#send-vn){.xref}. A
server [MAY]{.bcp14} limit the number of packets to which it responds
with a Version Negotiation packet. Servers [MUST]{.bcp14} drop smaller
packets that specify unsupported
versions.[¶](#section-5.2.2-1){.pilcrow}

The first packet for an unsupported version can use different semantics
and encodings for any version-specific field. In particular, different
packet protection keys might be used for different versions. Servers
that do not support a particular version are unlikely to be able to
decrypt the payload of the packet or properly interpret the result.
Servers [SHOULD]{.bcp14} respond with a Version Negotiation packet,
provided that the datagram is sufficiently
long.[¶](#section-5.2.2-2){.pilcrow}

Packets with a supported version, or no Version field, are matched to a
connection using the connection ID or \-- for packets with zero-length
connection IDs \-- the local address and port. These packets are
processed using the selected connection; otherwise, the server continues
as described below.[¶](#section-5.2.2-3){.pilcrow}

If the packet is an Initial packet fully conforming with the
specification, the server proceeds with the handshake ([Section
7](#handshake){.xref}). This commits the server to the version that the
client selected.[¶](#section-5.2.2-4){.pilcrow}

If a server refuses to accept a new connection, it [SHOULD]{.bcp14} send
an Initial packet containing a CONNECTION_CLOSE frame with error code
CONNECTION_REFUSED.[¶](#section-5.2.2-5){.pilcrow}

If the packet is a 0-RTT packet, the server [MAY]{.bcp14} buffer a
limited number of these packets in anticipation of a late-arriving
Initial packet. Clients are not able to send Handshake packets prior to
receiving a server response, so servers [SHOULD]{.bcp14} ignore any such
packets.[¶](#section-5.2.2-6){.pilcrow}

Servers [MUST]{.bcp14} drop incoming packets under all other
circumstances.[¶](#section-5.2.2-7){.pilcrow}

A server deployment could load-balance among servers using only source
and destination IP addresses and ports. Changes to the client\'s IP
address or port could result in packets being forwarded to the wrong
server. Such a server deployment could use one of the following methods
for connection continuity when a client\'s address
changes.[¶](#section-5.2.3-1){.pilcrow}

-   [Servers could use an out-of-band mechanism to forward packets to
    the correct server based on connection
    ID.[¶](#section-5.2.3-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.2.3-2.1}
-   [If servers can use a dedicated server IP address or port, other
    than the one that the client initially connects to, they could use
    the preferred_address transport parameter to request that clients
    move connections to that dedicated address. Note that clients could
    choose not to use the preferred
    address.[¶](#section-5.2.3-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.2.3-2.2}

A server in a deployment that does not implement a solution to maintain
connection continuity when the client address changes [SHOULD]{.bcp14}
indicate that migration is not supported by using the
disable_active_migration transport parameter. The
disable_active_migration transport parameter does not prohibit
connection migration after a client has acted on a preferred_address
transport parameter.[¶](#section-5.2.3-3){.pilcrow}

Server deployments that use this simple form of load balancing
[MUST]{.bcp14} avoid the creation of a stateless reset oracle; see

provides an interface that includes the operations described in this

protocol might provide only those operations that are used by that

## [6.](#section-6){.section-number .selfRef} [Version Negotiation](#name-version-negotiation){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-version-negotiation}

Version negotiation allows a server to indicate that it does not support
the version the client used. A server sends a Version Negotiation packet
in response to each packet that might initiate a new connection; see
[Section 5.2](#packet-handling){.xref} for
details.[¶](#section-6-1){.pilcrow}

The size of the first packet sent by a client will determine whether a
server sends a Version Negotiation packet. Clients that support multiple
QUIC versions [SHOULD]{.bcp14} ensure that the first UDP datagram they
send is sized to the largest of the minimum datagram sizes from all
versions they support, using PADDING frames ([Section
19.1](#frame-padding){.xref}) as necessary. This ensures that the server
responds if there is a mutually supported version. A server might not
send a Version Negotiation packet if the datagram it receives is smaller
than the minimum size specified in a different version; see [Section
14.1](#initial-size){.xref}.[¶](#section-6-2){.pilcrow}

### [6.1.](#section-6.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Sending Version Negotiation Packets](#name-sending-version-negotiation){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-sending-version-negotiation}

If the version selected by the client is not acceptable to the server,
the server responds with a Version Negotiation packet; see [Section
17.2.1](#packet-version){.xref}. This includes a list of versions that
the server will accept. An endpoint [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} send a Version
Negotiation packet in response to receiving a Version Negotiation
packet.[¶](#section-6.1-1){.pilcrow}

This system allows a server to process packets with unsupported versions
without retaining state. Though either the Initial packet or the Version
Negotiation packet that is sent in response could be lost, the client
will send new packets until it successfully receives a response or it
abandons the connection attempt.[¶](#section-6.1-2){.pilcrow}

A server [MAY]{.bcp14} limit the number of Version Negotiation packets
it sends. For instance, a server that is able to recognize packets as
0-RTT might choose not to send Version Negotiation packets in response
to 0-RTT packets with the expectation that it will eventually receive an
Initial packet.[¶](#section-6.1-3){.pilcrow}

Version Negotiation packets are designed to allow for functionality to
be defined in the future that allows QUIC to negotiate the version of
QUIC to use for a connection. Future Standards Track specifications
might change how implementations that support multiple versions of QUIC
react to Version Negotiation packets received in response to an attempt
to establish a connection using this
version.[¶](#section-6.2-1){.pilcrow}

A client that supports only this version of QUIC [MUST]{.bcp14} abandon
the current connection attempt if it receives a Version Negotiation
packet, with the following two exceptions. A client [MUST]{.bcp14}
discard any Version Negotiation packet if it has received and
successfully processed any other packet, including an earlier Version
Negotiation packet. A client [MUST]{.bcp14} discard a Version
Negotiation packet that lists the QUIC version selected by the
client.[¶](#section-6.2-2){.pilcrow}

How to perform version negotiation is left as future work defined by
future Standards Track specifications. In particular, that future work

QUIC relies on a combined cryptographic and transport handshake to
minimize connection establishment latency. QUIC uses the CRYPTO frame
([Section 19.6](#frame-crypto){.xref}) to transmit the cryptographic
handshake. The version of QUIC defined in this document is identified as
0x00000001 and uses TLS as described in
\[[QUIC-TLS](#QUIC-TLS){.xref}\]; a different QUIC version could
indicate that a different cryptographic handshake protocol is in
use.[¶](#section-7-1){.pilcrow}

QUIC provides reliable, ordered delivery of the cryptographic handshake
data. QUIC packet protection is used to encrypt as much of the handshake
protocol as possible. The cryptographic handshake [MUST]{.bcp14} provide
the following properties:[¶](#section-7-2){.pilcrow}

Details of how TLS is integrated with QUIC are provided in

An extension of this exchange to support client address validation is
shown in [Section
8.1.2](#validate-retry){.xref}.[¶](#section-7.1-1){.pilcrow}

Once any address validation exchanges are complete, the cryptographic
handshake is used to agree on cryptographic keys. The cryptographic
handshake is carried in Initial ([Section

17.2.4](#packet-handshake){.xref}) packets.[¶](#section-7.1-2){.pilcrow}

[Figure 5](#tls-1rtt-handshake){.xref} provides an overview of the 1-RTT
handshake. Each line shows a QUIC packet with the packet type and packet
number shown first, followed by the frames that are typically contained
in those packets. For instance, the first packet is of type Initial,
with packet number 0, and contains a CRYPTO frame carrying the
ClientHello.[¶](#section-7.1-3){.pilcrow}

Multiple QUIC packets \-- even of different packet types \-- can be
coalesced into a single UDP datagram; see [Section
12.2](#packet-coalesce){.xref}. As a result, this handshake could
consist of as few as four UDP datagrams, or any number more (subject to
limits inherent to the protocol, such as congestion control and
anti-amplification). For instance, the server\'s first flight contains
Initial packets, Handshake packets, and \"0.5-RTT data\" in 1-RTT
packets.[¶](#section-7.1-4){.pilcrow}

### [7.2.](#section-7.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Negotiating Connection IDs](#name-negotiating-connection-ids){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-negotiating-connection-ids}

A connection ID is used to ensure consistent routing of packets, as
described in [Section 5.1](#connection-id){.xref}. The long header
contains two connection IDs: the Destination Connection ID is chosen by
the recipient of the packet and is used to provide consistent routing;
the Source Connection ID is used to set the Destination Connection ID
used by the peer.[¶](#section-7.2-1){.pilcrow}

During the handshake, packets with the long header ([Section
17.2](#long-header){.xref}) are used to establish the connection IDs
used by both endpoints. Each endpoint uses the Source Connection ID
field to specify the connection ID that is used in the Destination
Connection ID field of packets being sent to them. After processing the
first Initial packet, each endpoint sets the Destination Connection ID
field in subsequent packets it sends to the value of the Source
Connection ID field that it received.[¶](#section-7.2-2){.pilcrow}

When an Initial packet is sent by a client that has not previously
received an Initial or Retry packet from the server, the client
populates the Destination Connection ID field with an unpredictable
value. This Destination Connection ID [MUST]{.bcp14} be at least 8 bytes
in length. Until a packet is received from the server, the client
[MUST]{.bcp14} use the same Destination Connection ID value on all
packets in this connection.[¶](#section-7.2-3){.pilcrow}

The Destination Connection ID field from the first Initial packet sent
by a client is used to determine packet protection keys for Initial
packets. These keys change after receiving a Retry packet; see [Section
5.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9001#section-5.2){.relref} of
\[[QUIC-TLS](#QUIC-TLS){.xref}\].[¶](#section-7.2-4){.pilcrow}

The client populates the Source Connection ID field with a value of its
choosing and sets the Source Connection ID Length field to indicate the
length.[¶](#section-7.2-5){.pilcrow}

0-RTT packets in the first flight use the same Destination Connection ID
and Source Connection ID values as the client\'s first Initial
packet.[¶](#section-7.2-6){.pilcrow}

Upon first receiving an Initial or Retry packet from the server, the
client uses the Source Connection ID supplied by the server as the
Destination Connection ID for subsequent packets, including any 0-RTT
packets. This means that a client might have to change the connection ID
it sets in the Destination Connection ID field twice during connection
establishment: once in response to a Retry packet and once in response
to an Initial packet from the server. Once a client has received a valid
Initial packet from the server, it [MUST]{.bcp14} discard any subsequent
packet it receives on that connection with a different Source Connection
ID.[¶](#section-7.2-7){.pilcrow}

A client [MUST]{.bcp14} change the Destination Connection ID it uses for
sending packets in response to only the first received Initial or Retry
packet. A server [MUST]{.bcp14} set the Destination Connection ID it
uses for sending packets based on the first received Initial packet. Any
further changes to the Destination Connection ID are only permitted if
the values are taken from NEW_CONNECTION_ID frames; if subsequent
Initial packets include a different Source Connection ID, they
[MUST]{.bcp14} be discarded. This avoids unpredictable outcomes that
might otherwise result from stateless processing of multiple Initial
packets with different Source Connection
IDs.[¶](#section-7.2-8){.pilcrow}

The Destination Connection ID that an endpoint sends can change over the
lifetime of a connection, especially in response to connection migration
([Section 9](#migration){.xref}); see [Section 5.1.1](#issue-cid){.xref}
for details.[¶](#section-7.2-9){.pilcrow}

### [7.3.](#section-7.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Authenticating Connection IDs](#name-authenticating-connection-i){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-authenticating-connection-i}

The choice each endpoint makes about connection IDs during the handshake
is authenticated by including all values in transport parameters; see
[Section 7.4](#transport-parameters){.xref}. This ensures that all
connection IDs used for the handshake are also authenticated by the
cryptographic handshake.[¶](#section-7.3-1){.pilcrow}

Each endpoint includes the value of the Source Connection ID field from
the first Initial packet it sent in the initial_source_connection_id
transport parameter; see [Section
18.2](#transport-parameter-definitions){.xref}. A server includes the
Destination Connection ID field from the first Initial packet it
received from the client in the original_destination_connection_id
transport parameter; if the server sent a Retry packet, this refers to
the first Initial packet received before sending the Retry packet. If it
sends a Retry packet, a server also includes the Source Connection ID
field from the Retry packet in the retry_source_connection_id transport
parameter.[¶](#section-7.3-2){.pilcrow}

The values provided by a peer for these transport parameters
[MUST]{.bcp14} match the values that an endpoint used in the Destination
and Source Connection ID fields of Initial packets that it sent (and
received, for servers). Endpoints [MUST]{.bcp14} validate that received
transport parameters match received connection ID values. Including
connection ID values in transport parameters and verifying them ensures
that an attacker cannot influence the choice of connection ID for a
successful connection by injecting packets carrying attacker-chosen
connection IDs during the handshake.[¶](#section-7.3-3){.pilcrow}

An endpoint [MUST]{.bcp14} treat the absence of the
initial_source_connection_id transport parameter from either endpoint or
the absence of the original_destination_connection_id transport
parameter from the server as a connection error of type
TRANSPORT_PARAMETER_ERROR.[¶](#section-7.3-4){.pilcrow}

An endpoint [MUST]{.bcp14} treat the following as a connection error of
type TRANSPORT_PARAMETER_ERROR or
PROTOCOL_VIOLATION:[¶](#section-7.3-5){.pilcrow}

-   [absence of the retry_source_connection_id transport parameter from

    parameters and the value sent in the corresponding Destination or

value.[¶](#section-7.3-7){.pilcrow}

During connection establishment, both endpoints make authenticated
declarations of their transport parameters. Endpoints are required to
comply with the restrictions that each parameter defines; the
description of each parameter includes rules for its
handling.[¶](#section-7.4-1){.pilcrow}

Transport parameters are declarations that are made unilaterally by each
endpoint. Each endpoint can choose values for transport parameters
independent of the values chosen by its
peer.[¶](#section-7.4-2){.pilcrow}

The encoding of the transport parameters is detailed in [Section
18](#transport-parameter-encoding){.xref}.[¶](#section-7.4-3){.pilcrow}

QUIC includes the encoded transport parameters in the cryptographic
handshake. Once the handshake completes, the transport parameters
declared by the peer are available. Each endpoint validates the values
provided by its peer.[¶](#section-7.4-4){.pilcrow}

Definitions for each of the defined transport parameters are included in
[Section
18.2](#transport-parameter-definitions){.xref}.[¶](#section-7.4-5){.pilcrow}

An endpoint [MUST]{.bcp14} treat receipt of a transport parameter with
an invalid value as a connection error of type
TRANSPORT_PARAMETER_ERROR.[¶](#section-7.4-6){.pilcrow}

An endpoint [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} send a parameter more than once in a
given transport parameters extension. An endpoint [SHOULD]{.bcp14} treat
receipt of duplicate transport parameters as a connection error of type
TRANSPORT_PARAMETER_ERROR.[¶](#section-7.4-7){.pilcrow}

Endpoints use transport parameters to authenticate the negotiation of
connection IDs during the handshake; see [Section
7.3](#cid-auth){.xref}.[¶](#section-7.4-8){.pilcrow}

ALPN (see \[[ALPN](#ALPN){.xref}\]) allows clients to offer multiple
application protocols during connection establishment. The transport
parameters that a client includes during the handshake apply to all
application protocols that the client offers. Application protocols can
recommend values for transport parameters, such as the initial flow
control limits. However, application protocols that set constraints on
values for transport parameters could make it impossible for a client to
offer multiple application protocols if these constraints
conflict.[¶](#section-7.4-9){.pilcrow}

Using 0-RTT depends on both client and server using protocol parameters
that were negotiated from a previous connection. To enable 0-RTT,
endpoints store the values of the server transport parameters with any
session tickets it receives on the connection. Endpoints also store any
information required by the application protocol or cryptographic
handshake; see [Section
4.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9001#section-4.6){.relref} of
\[[QUIC-TLS](#QUIC-TLS){.xref}\]. The values of stored transport
parameters are used when attempting 0-RTT using the session
tickets.[¶](#section-7.4.1-1){.pilcrow}

Remembered transport parameters apply to the new connection until the
handshake completes and the client starts sending 1-RTT packets. Once
the handshake completes, the client uses the transport parameters
established in the handshake. Not all transport parameters are
remembered, as some do not apply to future connections or they have no
effect on the use of 0-RTT.[¶](#section-7.4.1-2){.pilcrow}

The definition of a new transport parameter ([Section
7.4.2](#new-transport-parameters){.xref}) [MUST]{.bcp14} specify whether
storing the transport parameter for 0-RTT is mandatory, optional, or
prohibited. A client need not store a transport parameter it cannot
process.[¶](#section-7.4.1-3){.pilcrow}

A client [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} use remembered values for the following
parameters: ack_delay_exponent, max_ack_delay,
initial_source_connection_id, original_destination_connection_id,
preferred_address, retry_source_connection_id, and
stateless_reset_token. The client [MUST]{.bcp14} use the server\'s new
values in the handshake instead; if the server does not provide new
values, the default values are used.[¶](#section-7.4.1-4){.pilcrow}

A client that attempts to send 0-RTT data [MUST]{.bcp14} remember all
other transport parameters used by the server that it is able to
process. The server can remember these transport parameters or can store
an integrity-protected copy of the values in the ticket and recover the
information when accepting 0-RTT data. A server uses the transport
parameters in determining whether to accept 0-RTT
data.[¶](#section-7.4.1-5){.pilcrow}

If 0-RTT data is accepted by the server, the server [MUST NOT]{.bcp14}
reduce any limits or alter any values that might be violated by the
client with its 0-RTT data. In particular, a server that accepts 0-RTT
data [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} set values for the following parameters
([Section 18.2](#transport-parameter-definitions){.xref}) that are
smaller than the remembered values of the
parameters.[¶](#section-7.4.1-6){.pilcrow}

Omitting or setting a zero value for certain transport parameters can
result in 0-RTT data being enabled but not usable. The applicable subset
of transport parameters that permit the sending of application data
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} be set to non-zero values for 0-RTT. This includes
initial_max_data and either (1) initial_max_streams_bidi and
initial_max_stream_data_bidi_remote or (2) initial_max_streams_uni and
initial_max_stream_data_uni.[¶](#section-7.4.1-8){.pilcrow}

A server might provide larger initial stream flow control limits for
streams than the remembered values that a client applies when sending
0-RTT. Once the handshake completes, the client updates the flow control
limits on all sending streams using the updated values of
initial_max_stream_data_bidi_remote and
initial_max_stream_data_uni.[¶](#section-7.4.1-9){.pilcrow}

A server [MAY]{.bcp14} store and recover the previously sent values of
the max_idle_timeout, max_udp_payload_size, and disable_active_migration
parameters and reject 0-RTT if it selects smaller values. Lowering the
values of these parameters while also accepting 0-RTT data could degrade
the performance of the connection. Specifically, lowering the
max_udp_payload_size could result in dropped packets, leading to worse
performance compared to rejecting 0-RTT data
outright.[¶](#section-7.4.1-10){.pilcrow}

A server [MUST]{.bcp14} reject 0-RTT data if the restored values for
transport parameters cannot be
supported.[¶](#section-7.4.1-11){.pilcrow}

When sending frames in 0-RTT packets, a client [MUST]{.bcp14} only use
remembered transport parameters; importantly, it [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} use
updated values that it learns from the server\'s updated transport
parameters or from frames received in 1-RTT packets. Updated values of
transport parameters from the handshake apply only to 1-RTT packets. For
instance, flow control limits from remembered transport parameters apply
to all 0-RTT packets even if those values are increased by the handshake
or by frames sent in 1-RTT packets. A server [MAY]{.bcp14} treat the use
of updated transport parameters in 0-RTT as a connection error of type
PROTOCOL_VIOLATION.[¶](#section-7.4.1-12){.pilcrow}

New transport parameters can be used to negotiate new protocol behavior.
An endpoint [MUST]{.bcp14} ignore transport parameters that it does not
support. The absence of a transport parameter therefore disables any
optional protocol feature that is negotiated using the parameter. As
described in [Section 18.1](#transport-parameter-grease){.xref}, some
identifiers are reserved in order to exercise this
requirement.[¶](#section-7.4.2-1){.pilcrow}

A client that does not understand a transport parameter can discard it
and attempt 0-RTT on subsequent connections. However, if the client adds
support for a discarded transport parameter, it risks violating the
constraints that the transport parameter establishes if it attempts
0-RTT. New transport parameters can avoid this problem by setting a
default of the most conservative value. Clients can avoid this problem
by remembering all parameters, even those not currently
supported.[¶](#section-7.4.2-2){.pilcrow}

Implementations need to maintain a buffer of CRYPTO data received out of
order. Because there is no flow control of CRYPTO frames, an endpoint
could potentially force its peer to buffer an unbounded amount of
data.[¶](#section-7.5-1){.pilcrow}

Implementations [MUST]{.bcp14} support buffering at least 4096 bytes of
data received in out-of-order CRYPTO frames. Endpoints [MAY]{.bcp14}
choose to allow more data to be buffered during the handshake. A larger
limit during the handshake could allow for larger keys or credentials to
be exchanged. An endpoint\'s buffer size does not need to remain
constant during the life of the connection.[¶](#section-7.5-2){.pilcrow}

Being unable to buffer CRYPTO frames during the handshake can lead to a
connection failure. If an endpoint\'s buffer is exceeded during the
handshake, it can expand its buffer temporarily to complete the
handshake. If an endpoint does not expand its buffer, it [MUST]{.bcp14}
close the connection with a CRYPTO_BUFFER_EXCEEDED error
code.[¶](#section-7.5-3){.pilcrow}

Once the handshake completes, if an endpoint is unable to buffer all
data in a CRYPTO frame, it [MAY]{.bcp14} discard that CRYPTO frame and
all CRYPTO frames received in the future, or it [MAY]{.bcp14} close the
connection with a CRYPTO_BUFFER_EXCEEDED error code. Packets containing
discarded CRYPTO frames [MUST]{.bcp14} be acknowledged because the
packet has been received and processed by the transport even though the
CRYPTO frame was discarded.[¶](#section-7.5-4){.pilcrow}

::: {#address-validation}
::: {#section-8 .section}
## [8.](#section-8){.section-number .selfRef} [Address Validation](#name-address-validation){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-address-validation}

Address validation ensures that an endpoint cannot be used for a traffic
amplification attack. In such an attack, a packet is sent to a server
with spoofed source address information that identifies a victim. If a
server generates more or larger packets in response to that packet, the
attacker can use the server to send more data toward the victim than it
would be able to send on its own.[¶](#section-8-1){.pilcrow}

The primary defense against amplification attacks is verifying that a
peer is able to receive packets at the transport address that it claims.
Therefore, after receiving packets from an address that is not yet
validated, an endpoint [MUST]{.bcp14} limit the amount of data it sends
to the unvalidated address to three times the amount of data received
from that address. This limit on the size of responses is known as the
anti-amplification limit.[¶](#section-8-2){.pilcrow}

Address validation is performed both during connection establishment
(see [Section 8.1](#validate-handshake){.xref}) and during connection
migration (see [Section
8.2](#migrate-validate){.xref}).[¶](#section-8-3){.pilcrow}

### [8.1.](#section-8.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Address Validation during Connection Establishment](#name-address-validation-during-c){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-address-validation-during-c}

Connection establishment implicitly provides address validation for both
endpoints. In particular, receipt of a packet protected with Handshake
keys confirms that the peer successfully processed an Initial packet.
Once an endpoint has successfully processed a Handshake packet from the
peer, it can consider the peer address to have been
validated.[¶](#section-8.1-1){.pilcrow}

Additionally, an endpoint [MAY]{.bcp14} consider the peer address
validated if the peer uses a connection ID chosen by the endpoint and
the connection ID contains at least 64 bits of
entropy.[¶](#section-8.1-2){.pilcrow}

For the client, the value of the Destination Connection ID field in its
first Initial packet allows it to validate the server address as a part
of successfully processing any packet. Initial packets from the server
are protected with keys that are derived from this value (see [Section
5.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9001#section-5.2){.relref} of
\[[QUIC-TLS](#QUIC-TLS){.xref}\]). Alternatively, the value is echoed by
the server in Version Negotiation packets ([Section
6](#version-negotiation){.xref}) or included in the Integrity Tag in
Retry packets ([Section
5.8](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9001#section-5.8){.relref} of
\[[QUIC-TLS](#QUIC-TLS){.xref}\]).[¶](#section-8.1-3){.pilcrow}

Prior to validating the client address, servers [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} send
more than three times as many bytes as the number of bytes they have
received. This limits the magnitude of any amplification attack that can
be mounted using spoofed source addresses. For the purposes of avoiding
amplification prior to address validation, servers [MUST]{.bcp14} count
all of the payload bytes received in datagrams that are uniquely
attributed to a single connection. This includes datagrams that contain
packets that are successfully processed and datagrams that contain
packets that are all discarded.[¶](#section-8.1-4){.pilcrow}

Clients [MUST]{.bcp14} ensure that UDP datagrams containing Initial
packets have UDP payloads of at least 1200 bytes, adding PADDING frames
as necessary. A client that sends padded datagrams allows the server to
send more data prior to completing address
validation.[¶](#section-8.1-5){.pilcrow}

Loss of an Initial or Handshake packet from the server can cause a
deadlock if the client does not send additional Initial or Handshake
packets. A deadlock could occur when the server reaches its
anti-amplification limit and the client has received acknowledgments for
all the data it has sent. In this case, when the client has no reason to
send additional packets, the server will be unable to send more data
because it has not validated the client\'s address. To prevent this
deadlock, clients [MUST]{.bcp14} send a packet on a Probe Timeout (PTO);
see [Section
6.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9002#section-6.2){.relref} of
\[[QUIC-RECOVERY](#QUIC-RECOVERY){.xref}\]. Specifically, the client

least 1200 bytes if it does not have Handshake keys, and otherwise send
a Handshake packet.[¶](#section-8.1-6){.pilcrow}

A server might wish to validate the client address before starting the
cryptographic handshake. QUIC uses a token in the Initial packet to
provide address validation prior to completing the handshake. This token
is delivered to the client during connection establishment with a Retry
packet (see [Section 8.1.2](#validate-retry){.xref}) or in a previous
connection using the NEW_TOKEN frame (see [Section
8.1.3](#validate-future){.xref}).[¶](#section-8.1-7){.pilcrow}

In addition to sending limits imposed prior to address validation,
servers are also constrained in what they can send by the limits set by
the congestion controller. Clients are only constrained by the
congestion controller.[¶](#section-8.1-8){.pilcrow}

A token sent in a NEW_TOKEN frame or a Retry packet [MUST]{.bcp14} be
constructed in a way that allows the server to identify how it was
provided to a client. These tokens are carried in the same field but
require different handling from servers.[¶](#section-8.1.1-1){.pilcrow}

#### [8.1.2.](#section-8.1.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Address Validation Using Retry Packets](#name-address-validation-using-re){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-address-validation-using-re}

Upon receiving the client\'s Initial packet, the server can request
address validation by sending a Retry packet ([Section
17.2.5](#packet-retry){.xref}) containing a token. This token
[MUST]{.bcp14} be repeated by the client in all Initial packets it sends
for that connection after it receives the Retry
packet.[¶](#section-8.1.2-1){.pilcrow}

In response to processing an Initial packet containing a token that was
provided in a Retry packet, a server cannot send another Retry packet;
it can only refuse the connection or permit it to
proceed.[¶](#section-8.1.2-2){.pilcrow}

As long as it is not possible for an attacker to generate a valid token
for its own address (see [Section 8.1.4](#token-integrity){.xref}) and
the client is able to return that token, it proves to the server that it
received the token.[¶](#section-8.1.2-3){.pilcrow}

A server can also use a Retry packet to defer the state and processing
costs of connection establishment. Requiring the server to provide a
different connection ID, along with the
original_destination_connection_id transport parameter defined in
[Section 18.2](#transport-parameter-definitions){.xref}, forces the
server to demonstrate that it, or an entity it cooperates with, received
the original Initial packet from the client. Providing a different
connection ID also grants a server some control over how subsequent
packets are routed. This can be used to direct connections to a
different server instance.[¶](#section-8.1.2-4){.pilcrow}

If a server receives a client Initial that contains an invalid Retry
token but is otherwise valid, it knows the client will not accept
another Retry token. The server can discard such a packet and allow the
client to time out to detect handshake failure, but that could impose a
significant latency penalty on the client. Instead, the server
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} immediately close ([Section
10.2](#immediate-close){.xref}) the connection with an INVALID_TOKEN
error. Note that a server has not established any state for the
connection at this point and so does not enter the closing
period.[¶](#section-8.1.2-5){.pilcrow}

A server [MAY]{.bcp14} provide clients with an address validation token
during one connection that can be used on a subsequent connection.
Address validation is especially important with 0-RTT because a server
potentially sends a significant amount of data to a client in response
to 0-RTT data.[¶](#section-8.1.3-1){.pilcrow}

The server uses the NEW_TOKEN frame ([Section
19.7](#frame-new-token){.xref}) to provide the client with an address
validation token that can be used to validate future connections. In a
future connection, the client includes this token in Initial packets to
provide address validation. The client [MUST]{.bcp14} include the token
in all Initial packets it sends, unless a Retry replaces the token with
a newer one. The client [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} use the token provided in a
Retry for future connections. Servers [MAY]{.bcp14} discard any Initial
packet that does not carry the expected
token.[¶](#section-8.1.3-2){.pilcrow}

Unlike the token that is created for a Retry packet, which is used
immediately, the token sent in the NEW_TOKEN frame can be used after
some period of time has passed. Thus, a token [SHOULD]{.bcp14} have an
expiration time, which could be either an explicit expiration time or an
issued timestamp that can be used to dynamically calculate the
expiration time. A server can store the expiration time or include it in
an encrypted form in the token.[¶](#section-8.1.3-3){.pilcrow}

A token issued with NEW_TOKEN [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} include information
that would allow values to be linked by an observer to the connection on
which it was issued. For example, it cannot include the previous
connection ID or addressing information, unless the values are
encrypted. A server [MUST]{.bcp14} ensure that every NEW_TOKEN frame it
sends is unique across all clients, with the exception of those sent to
repair losses of previously sent NEW_TOKEN frames. Information that
allows the server to distinguish between tokens from Retry and NEW_TOKEN
[MAY]{.bcp14} be accessible to entities other than the
server.[¶](#section-8.1.3-4){.pilcrow}

It is unlikely that the client port number is the same on two different
connections; validating the port is therefore unlikely to be
successful.[¶](#section-8.1.3-5){.pilcrow}

A token received in a NEW_TOKEN frame is applicable to any server that
the connection is considered authoritative for (e.g., server names
included in the certificate). When connecting to a server for which the
client retains an applicable and unused token, it [SHOULD]{.bcp14}
include that token in the Token field of its Initial packet. Including a
token might allow the server to validate the client address without an
additional round trip. A client [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} include a token that
is not applicable to the server that it is connecting to, unless the
client has the knowledge that the server that issued the token and the
server the client is connecting to are jointly managing the tokens. A
client [MAY]{.bcp14} use a token from any previous connection to that
server.[¶](#section-8.1.3-6){.pilcrow}

A token allows a server to correlate activity between the connection
where the token was issued and any connection where it is used. Clients
that want to break continuity of identity with a server can discard
tokens provided using the NEW_TOKEN frame. In comparison, a token
obtained in a Retry packet [MUST]{.bcp14} be used immediately during the
connection attempt and cannot be used in subsequent connection
attempts.[¶](#section-8.1.3-7){.pilcrow}

A client [SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} reuse a token from a NEW_TOKEN frame for
different connection attempts. Reusing a token allows connections to be
linked by entities on the network path; see [Section
9.5](#migration-linkability){.xref}.[¶](#section-8.1.3-8){.pilcrow}

Clients might receive multiple tokens on a single connection. Aside from
preventing linkability, any token can be used in any connection attempt.
Servers can send additional tokens to either enable address validation
for multiple connection attempts or replace older tokens that might
become invalid. For a client, this ambiguity means that sending the most
recent unused token is most likely to be effective. Though saving and
using older tokens have no negative consequences, clients can regard
older tokens as being less likely to be useful to the server for address
validation.[¶](#section-8.1.3-9){.pilcrow}

When a server receives an Initial packet with an address validation
token, it [MUST]{.bcp14} attempt to validate the token, unless it has
already completed address validation. If the token is invalid, then the
server [SHOULD]{.bcp14} proceed as if the client did not have a
validated address, including potentially sending a Retry packet. Tokens
provided with NEW_TOKEN frames and Retry packets can be distinguished by
servers (see [Section 8.1.1](#token-differentiation){.xref}), and the
latter can be validated more strictly. If the validation succeeds, the
server [SHOULD]{.bcp14} then allow the handshake to
proceed.[¶](#section-8.1.3-10){.pilcrow}

Note: The rationale for treating the client as unvalidated rather than
discarding the packet is that the client might have received the token
in a previous connection using the NEW_TOKEN frame, and if the server
has lost state, it might be unable to validate the token at all, leading
to connection failure if the packet is
discarded.[¶](#section-8.1.3-11.1){.pilcrow}

In a stateless design, a server can use encrypted and authenticated
tokens to pass information to clients that the server can later recover
and use to validate a client address. Tokens are not integrated into the
cryptographic handshake, and so they are not authenticated. For
instance, a client might be able to reuse a token. To avoid attacks that
exploit this property, a server can limit its use of tokens to only the
information needed to validate client
addresses.[¶](#section-8.1.3-12){.pilcrow}

Clients [MAY]{.bcp14} use tokens obtained on one connection for any
connection attempt using the same version. When selecting a token to
use, clients do not need to consider other properties of the connection
that is being attempted, including the choice of possible application
protocols, session tickets, or other connection
properties.[¶](#section-8.1.3-13){.pilcrow}

#### [8.1.4.](#section-8.1.4){.section-number .selfRef} [Address Validation Token Integrity](#name-address-validation-token-in){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-address-validation-token-in}

An address validation token [MUST]{.bcp14} be difficult to guess.
Including a random value with at least 128 bits of entropy in the token
would be sufficient, but this depends on the server remembering the
value it sends to clients.[¶](#section-8.1.4-1){.pilcrow}

A token-based scheme allows the server to offload any state associated
with validation to the client. For this design to work, the token
[MUST]{.bcp14} be covered by integrity protection against modification
or falsification by clients. Without integrity protection, malicious
clients could generate or guess values for tokens that would be accepted
by the server. Only the server requires access to the integrity
protection key for tokens.[¶](#section-8.1.4-2){.pilcrow}

There is no need for a single well-defined format for the token because
the server that generates the token also consumes it. Tokens sent in
Retry packets [SHOULD]{.bcp14} include information that allows the
server to verify that the source IP address and port in client packets
remain constant.[¶](#section-8.1.4-3){.pilcrow}

Tokens sent in NEW_TOKEN frames [MUST]{.bcp14} include information that
allows the server to verify that the client IP address has not changed
from when the token was issued. Servers can use tokens from NEW_TOKEN
frames in deciding not to send a Retry packet, even if the client
address has changed. If the client IP address has changed, the server
[MUST]{.bcp14} adhere to the anti-amplification limit; see [Section
8](#address-validation){.xref}. Note that in the presence of NAT, this
requirement might be insufficient to protect other hosts that share the
NAT from amplification attacks.[¶](#section-8.1.4-4){.pilcrow}

Attackers could replay tokens to use servers as amplifiers in DDoS
attacks. To protect against such attacks, servers [MUST]{.bcp14} ensure
that replay of tokens is prevented or limited. Servers [SHOULD]{.bcp14}
ensure that tokens sent in Retry packets are only accepted for a short
time, as they are returned immediately by clients. Tokens that are
provided in NEW_TOKEN frames ([Section 19.7](#frame-new-token){.xref})
need to be valid for longer but [SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} be accepted
multiple times. Servers are encouraged to allow tokens to be used only
once, if possible; tokens [MAY]{.bcp14} include additional information
about clients to further narrow applicability or
reuse.[¶](#section-8.1.4-5){.pilcrow}

### [8.2.](#section-8.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Path Validation](#name-path-validation){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-path-validation}

Path validation is used by both peers during connection migration (see
[Section 9](#migration){.xref}) to verify reachability after a change of
address. In path validation, endpoints test reachability between a
specific local address and a specific peer address, where an address is
the 2-tuple of IP address and port.[¶](#section-8.2-1){.pilcrow}

Path validation tests that packets sent on a path to a peer are received
by that peer. Path validation is used to ensure that packets received
from a migrating peer do not carry a spoofed source
address.[¶](#section-8.2-2){.pilcrow}

Path validation does not validate that a peer can send in the return
direction. Acknowledgments cannot be used for return path validation
because they contain insufficient entropy and might be spoofed.
Endpoints independently determine reachability on each direction of a
path, and therefore return reachability can only be established by the
peer.[¶](#section-8.2-3){.pilcrow}

Path validation can be used at any time by either endpoint. For
instance, an endpoint might check that a peer is still in possession of
its address after a period of quiescence.[¶](#section-8.2-4){.pilcrow}

Path validation is not designed as a NAT traversal mechanism. Though the
mechanism described here might be effective for the creation of NAT
bindings that support NAT traversal, the expectation is that one
endpoint is able to receive packets without first having sent a packet
on that path. Effective NAT traversal needs additional synchronization
mechanisms that are not provided here.[¶](#section-8.2-5){.pilcrow}

An endpoint [MAY]{.bcp14} include other frames with the PATH_CHALLENGE
and PATH_RESPONSE frames used for path validation. In particular, an
endpoint can include PADDING frames with a PATH_CHALLENGE frame for Path
Maximum Transmission Unit Discovery (PMTUD); see [Section
14.2.1](#pmtud){.xref}. An endpoint can also include its own
PATH_CHALLENGE frame when sending a PATH_RESPONSE
frame.[¶](#section-8.2-6){.pilcrow}

An endpoint uses a new connection ID for probes sent from a new local
address; see [Section 9.5](#migration-linkability){.xref}. When probing
a new path, an endpoint can ensure that its peer has an unused
connection ID available for responses. Sending NEW_CONNECTION_ID and
PATH_CHALLENGE frames in the same packet, if the peer\'s
active_connection_id_limit permits, ensures that an unused connection ID
will be available to the peer when sending a
response.[¶](#section-8.2-7){.pilcrow}

An endpoint can choose to simultaneously probe multiple paths. The
number of simultaneous paths used for probes is limited by the number of
extra connection IDs its peer has previously supplied, since each new
local address used for a probe requires a previously unused connection
ID.[¶](#section-8.2-8){.pilcrow}

#### [8.2.1.](#section-8.2.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Initiating Path Validation](#name-initiating-path-validation){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-initiating-path-validation}

To initiate path validation, an endpoint sends a PATH_CHALLENGE frame
containing an unpredictable payload on the path to be
validated.[¶](#section-8.2.1-1){.pilcrow}

An endpoint [MAY]{.bcp14} send multiple PATH_CHALLENGE frames to guard
against packet loss. However, an endpoint [SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} send
multiple PATH_CHALLENGE frames in a single
packet.[¶](#section-8.2.1-2){.pilcrow}

An endpoint [SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} probe a new path with packets
containing a PATH_CHALLENGE frame more frequently than it would send an
Initial packet. This ensures that connection migration is no more load
on a new path than establishing a new
connection.[¶](#section-8.2.1-3){.pilcrow}

The endpoint [MUST]{.bcp14} use unpredictable data in every
PATH_CHALLENGE frame so that it can associate the peer\'s response with
the corresponding PATH_CHALLENGE.[¶](#section-8.2.1-4){.pilcrow}

An endpoint [MUST]{.bcp14} expand datagrams that contain a
PATH_CHALLENGE frame to at least the smallest allowed maximum datagram
size of 1200 bytes, unless the anti-amplification limit for the path
does not permit sending a datagram of this size. Sending UDP datagrams
of this size ensures that the network path from the endpoint to the peer
can be used for QUIC; see [Section
14](#datagram-size){.xref}.[¶](#section-8.2.1-5){.pilcrow}

When an endpoint is unable to expand the datagram size to 1200 bytes due
to the anti-amplification limit, the path MTU will not be validated. To
ensure that the path MTU is large enough, the endpoint [MUST]{.bcp14}
perform a second path validation by sending a PATH_CHALLENGE frame in a
datagram of at least 1200 bytes. This additional validation can be
performed after a PATH_RESPONSE is successfully received or when enough
bytes have been received on the path that sending the larger datagram
will not result in exceeding the anti-amplification
limit.[¶](#section-8.2.1-6){.pilcrow}

Unlike other cases where datagrams are expanded, endpoints [MUST
NOT]{.bcp14} discard datagrams that appear to be too small when they
contain PATH_CHALLENGE or PATH_RESPONSE.[¶](#section-8.2.1-7){.pilcrow}

On receiving a PATH_CHALLENGE frame, an endpoint [MUST]{.bcp14} respond
by echoing the data contained in the PATH_CHALLENGE frame in a
PATH_RESPONSE frame. An endpoint [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} delay transmission
of a packet containing a PATH_RESPONSE frame unless constrained by
congestion control.[¶](#section-8.2.2-1){.pilcrow}

A PATH_RESPONSE frame [MUST]{.bcp14} be sent on the network path where
the PATH_CHALLENGE frame was received. This ensures that path validation
by a peer only succeeds if the path is functional in both directions.
This requirement [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be enforced by the endpoint that
initiates path validation, as that would enable an attack on migration;
see [Section
9.3.3](#off-path-forward){.xref}.[¶](#section-8.2.2-2){.pilcrow}

An endpoint [MUST]{.bcp14} expand datagrams that contain a PATH_RESPONSE
frame to at least the smallest allowed maximum datagram size of 1200
bytes. This verifies that the path is able to carry datagrams of this
size in both directions. However, an endpoint [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} expand
the datagram containing the PATH_RESPONSE if the resulting data exceeds
the anti-amplification limit. This is expected to only occur if the
received PATH_CHALLENGE was not sent in an expanded
datagram.[¶](#section-8.2.2-3){.pilcrow}

An endpoint [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} send more than one PATH_RESPONSE frame in
response to one PATH_CHALLENGE frame; see [Section
13.3](#retransmission-of-information){.xref}. The peer is expected to
send more PATH_CHALLENGE frames as necessary to evoke additional
PATH_RESPONSE frames.[¶](#section-8.2.2-4){.pilcrow}

Path validation succeeds when a PATH_RESPONSE frame is received that
contains the data that was sent in a previous PATH_CHALLENGE frame. A
PATH_RESPONSE frame received on any network path validates the path on
which the PATH_CHALLENGE was sent.[¶](#section-8.2.3-1){.pilcrow}

If an endpoint sends a PATH_CHALLENGE frame in a datagram that is not
expanded to at least 1200 bytes and if the response to it validates the
peer address, the path is validated but not the path MTU. As a result,
the endpoint can now send more than three times the amount of data that
has been received. However, the endpoint [MUST]{.bcp14} initiate another
path validation with an expanded datagram to verify that the path
supports the required MTU.[¶](#section-8.2.3-2){.pilcrow}

Path validation only fails when the endpoint attempting to validate the
path abandons its attempt to validate the
path.[¶](#section-8.2.4-1){.pilcrow}

Endpoints [SHOULD]{.bcp14} abandon path validation based on a timer.
When setting this timer, implementations are cautioned that the new path
could have a longer round-trip time than the original. A value of three
times the larger of the current PTO or the PTO for the new path (using
kInitialRtt, as defined in \[[QUIC-RECOVERY](#QUIC-RECOVERY){.xref}\])
is [RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14}.[¶](#section-8.2.4-2){.pilcrow}

This timeout allows for multiple PTOs to expire prior to failing path
validation, so that loss of a single PATH_CHALLENGE or PATH_RESPONSE
frame does not cause path validation
failure.[¶](#section-8.2.4-3){.pilcrow}

Note that the endpoint might receive packets containing other frames on
the new path, but a PATH_RESPONSE frame with appropriate data is
required for path validation to succeed.[¶](#section-8.2.4-4){.pilcrow}

When an endpoint abandons path validation, it determines that the path
is unusable. This does not necessarily imply a failure of the connection
\-- endpoints can continue sending packets over other paths as
appropriate. If no paths are available, an endpoint can wait for a new
path to become available or close the connection. An endpoint that has
no valid network path to its peer [MAY]{.bcp14} signal this using the
NO_VIABLE_PATH connection error, noting that this is only possible if
the network path exists but does not support the required MTU ([Section
14](#datagram-size){.xref}).[¶](#section-8.2.4-5){.pilcrow}

A path validation might be abandoned for other reasons besides failure.
Primarily, this happens if a connection migration to a new path is

The use of a connection ID allows connections to survive changes to
endpoint addresses (IP address and port), such as those caused by an
endpoint migrating to a new network. This section describes the process
by which an endpoint migrates to a new
address.[¶](#section-9-1){.pilcrow}

The design of QUIC relies on endpoints retaining a stable address for
the duration of the handshake. An endpoint [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} initiate
connection migration before the handshake is confirmed, as defined in
[Section
4.1.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9001#section-4.1.2){.relref} of
\[[QUIC-TLS](#QUIC-TLS){.xref}\].[¶](#section-9-2){.pilcrow}

If the peer sent the disable_active_migration transport parameter, an
endpoint also [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} send packets (including probing
packets; see [Section 9.1](#probing){.xref}) from a different local
address to the address the peer used during the handshake, unless the
endpoint has acted on a preferred_address transport parameter from the
peer. If the peer violates this requirement, the endpoint [MUST]{.bcp14}
either drop the incoming packets on that path without generating a
Stateless Reset or proceed with path validation and allow the peer to
migrate. Generating a Stateless Reset or closing the connection would
allow third parties in the network to cause connections to close by
spoofing or otherwise manipulating observed
traffic.[¶](#section-9-3){.pilcrow}

Not all changes of peer address are intentional, or active, migrations.
The peer could experience NAT rebinding: a change of address due to a
middlebox, usually a NAT, allocating a new outgoing port or even a new
outgoing IP address for a flow. An endpoint [MUST]{.bcp14} perform path
validation ([Section 8.2](#migrate-validate){.xref}) if it detects any
change to a peer\'s address, unless it has previously validated that
address.[¶](#section-9-4){.pilcrow}

When an endpoint has no validated path on which to send packets, it
[MAY]{.bcp14} discard connection state. An endpoint capable of
connection migration [MAY]{.bcp14} wait for a new path to become
available before discarding connection state.[¶](#section-9-5){.pilcrow}

This document limits migration of connections to new client addresses,
except as described in [Section 9.6](#preferred-address){.xref}. Clients
are responsible for initiating all migrations. Servers do not send

address. Thus, an endpoint can migrate to a new local address without
first validating the peer\'s address.[¶](#section-9.2-2){.pilcrow}

To establish reachability on the new path, an endpoint initiates path
validation ([Section 8.2](#migrate-validate){.xref}) on the new path. An
endpoint [MAY]{.bcp14} defer path validation until after a peer sends
the next non-probing frame to its new
address.[¶](#section-9.2-3){.pilcrow}

When migrating, the new path might not support the endpoint\'s current
sending rate. Therefore, the endpoint resets its congestion controller
and RTT estimate, as described in [Section

Receiving a packet from a new peer address containing a non-probing
frame indicates that the peer has migrated to that
address.[¶](#section-9.3-1){.pilcrow}

If the recipient permits the migration, it [MUST]{.bcp14} send
subsequent packets to the new peer address and [MUST]{.bcp14} initiate
path validation ([Section 8.2](#migrate-validate){.xref}) to verify the
peer\'s ownership of the address if validation is not already underway.
If the recipient has no unused connection IDs from the peer, it will not
be able to send anything on the new path until the peer provides one;
see [Section
9.5](#migration-linkability){.xref}.[¶](#section-9.3-2){.pilcrow}

An endpoint only changes the address to which it sends packets in
response to the highest-numbered non-probing packet. This ensures that
an endpoint does not send packets to an old peer address in the case
that it receives reordered packets.[¶](#section-9.3-3){.pilcrow}

An endpoint [MAY]{.bcp14} send data to an unvalidated peer address, but
it [MUST]{.bcp14} protect against potential attacks as described in
Sections [9.3.1](#address-spoofing){.xref} and
[9.3.2](#on-path-spoofing){.xref}. An endpoint [MAY]{.bcp14} skip
validation of a peer address if that address has been seen recently. In
particular, if an endpoint returns to a previously validated path after
detecting some form of spurious migration, skipping address validation
and restoring loss detection and congestion state can reduce the
performance impact of the attack.[¶](#section-9.3-4){.pilcrow}

After changing the address to which it sends non-probing packets, an
endpoint can abandon any path validation for other
addresses.[¶](#section-9.3-5){.pilcrow}

Receiving a packet from a new peer address could be the result of a NAT
rebinding at the peer.[¶](#section-9.3-6){.pilcrow}

new address validation tokens ([Section 8](#address-validation){.xref})
to the client.[¶](#section-9.3-7){.pilcrow}

It is possible that a peer is spoofing its source address to cause an
endpoint to send excessive amounts of data to an unwilling host. If the
endpoint sends significantly more data than the spoofing peer,
connection migration might be used to amplify the volume of data that an
attacker can generate toward a victim.[¶](#section-9.3.1-1){.pilcrow}

As described in [Section 9.3](#migration-response){.xref}, an endpoint
is required to validate a peer\'s new address to confirm the peer\'s
possession of the new address. Until a peer\'s address is deemed valid,
an endpoint limits the amount of data it sends to that address; see
[Section 8](#address-validation){.xref}. In the absence of this limit,
an endpoint risks being used for a denial-of-service attack against an
unsuspecting victim.[¶](#section-9.3.1-2){.pilcrow}

If an endpoint skips validation of a peer address as described above, it
does not need to limit its sending rate.[¶](#section-9.3.1-3){.pilcrow}

An on-path attacker could cause a spurious connection migration by
copying and forwarding a packet with a spoofed address such that it
arrives before the original packet. The packet with the spoofed address
will be seen to come from a migrating connection, and the original
packet will be seen as a duplicate and dropped. After a spurious
migration, validation of the source address will fail because the entity
at the source address does not have the necessary cryptographic keys to
read or respond to the PATH_CHALLENGE frame that is sent to it even if
it wanted to.[¶](#section-9.3.2-1){.pilcrow}

To protect the connection from failing due to such a spurious migration,
an endpoint [MUST]{.bcp14} revert to using the last validated peer
address when validation of a new peer address fails. Additionally,
receipt of packets with higher packet numbers from the legitimate peer
address will trigger another connection migration. This will cause the
validation of the address of the spurious migration to be abandoned,
thus containing migrations initiated by the attacker injecting a single
packet.[¶](#section-9.3.2-2){.pilcrow}

If an endpoint has no state about the last validated peer address, it
[MUST]{.bcp14} close the connection silently by discarding all
connection state. This results in new packets on the connection being
handled generically. For instance, an endpoint [MAY]{.bcp14} send a
Stateless Reset in response to any further incoming
packets.[¶](#section-9.3.2-3){.pilcrow}

An off-path attacker that can observe packets might forward copies of
genuine packets to endpoints. If the copied packet arrives before the
genuine packet, this will appear as a NAT rebinding. Any genuine packet
will be discarded as a duplicate. If the attacker is able to continue
forwarding packets, it might be able to cause migration to a path via
the attacker. This places the attacker on-path, giving it the ability to
observe or drop all subsequent packets.[¶](#section-9.3.3-1){.pilcrow}

This style of attack relies on the attacker using a path that has
approximately the same characteristics as the direct path between
endpoints. The attack is more reliable if relatively few packets are
sent or if packet loss coincides with the attempted
attack.[¶](#section-9.3.3-2){.pilcrow}

A non-probing packet received on the original path that increases the
maximum received packet number will cause the endpoint to move back to
that path. Eliciting packets on this path increases the likelihood that
the attack is unsuccessful. Therefore, mitigation of this attack relies
on triggering the exchange of packets.[¶](#section-9.3.3-3){.pilcrow}

In response to an apparent migration, endpoints [MUST]{.bcp14} validate
the previously active path using a PATH_CHALLENGE frame. This induces
the sending of new packets on that path. If the path is no longer
viable, the validation attempt will time out and fail; if the path is
viable but no longer desired, the validation will succeed but only
results in probing packets being sent on the
path.[¶](#section-9.3.3-4){.pilcrow}

An endpoint that receives a PATH_CHALLENGE on an active path
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} send a non-probing packet in response. If the
non-probing packet arrives before any copy made by an attacker, this
results in the connection being migrated back to the original path. Any
subsequent migration to another path restarts this entire
process.[¶](#section-9.3.3-5){.pilcrow}

This defense is imperfect, but this is not considered a serious problem.
If the path via the attack is reliably faster than the original path
despite multiple attempts to use that original path, it is not possible
to distinguish between an attack and an improvement in
routing.[¶](#section-9.3.3-6){.pilcrow}

An endpoint could also use heuristics to improve detection of this style
of attack. For instance, NAT rebinding is improbable if packets were
recently received on the old path; similarly, rebinding is rare on IPv6
paths. Endpoints can also look for duplicated packets. Conversely, a
change in connection ID is more likely to indicate an intentional
migration rather than an attack.[¶](#section-9.3.3-7){.pilcrow}

The capacity available on the new path might not be the same as the old
path. Packets sent on the old path [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} contribute to
congestion control or RTT estimation for the new
path.[¶](#section-9.4-1){.pilcrow}

On confirming a peer\'s ownership of its new address, an endpoint
[MUST]{.bcp14} immediately reset the congestion controller and
round-trip time estimator for the new path to initial values (see
Appendices
[A.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9002#appendix-A.3){.relref} and
[B.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9002#appendix-B.3){.relref} of
\[[QUIC-RECOVERY](#QUIC-RECOVERY){.xref}\]) unless the only change in
the peer\'s address is its port number. Because port-only changes are
commonly the result of NAT rebinding or other middlebox activity, the
endpoint [MAY]{.bcp14} instead retain its congestion control state and
round-trip estimate in those cases instead of reverting to initial
values. In cases where congestion control state retained from an old
path is used on a new path with substantially different characteristics,
a sender could transmit too aggressively until the congestion controller
and the RTT estimator have adapted. Generally, implementations are
advised to be cautious when using previous values on a new
path.[¶](#section-9.4-2){.pilcrow}

There could be apparent reordering at the receiver when an endpoint
sends data and probes from/to multiple addresses during the migration
period, since the two resulting paths could have different round-trip
times. A receiver of packets on multiple paths will still send ACK
frames covering all received packets.[¶](#section-9.4-3){.pilcrow}

While multiple paths might be used during connection migration, a single
congestion control context and a single loss recovery context (as
described in \[[QUIC-RECOVERY](#QUIC-RECOVERY){.xref}\]) could be
adequate. For instance, an endpoint might delay switching to a new
congestion control context until it is confirmed that an old path is no
longer needed (such as the case described in [Section
9.3.3](#off-path-forward){.xref}).[¶](#section-9.4-4){.pilcrow}

A sender can make exceptions for probe packets so that their loss
detection is independent and does not unduly cause the congestion
controller to reduce its sending rate. An endpoint might set a separate
timer when a PATH_CHALLENGE is sent, which is canceled if the
corresponding PATH_RESPONSE is received. If the timer fires before the
PATH_RESPONSE is received, the endpoint might send a new PATH_CHALLENGE
and restart the timer for a longer period of time. This timer
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} be set as described in [Section

### [9.5.](#section-9.5){.section-number .selfRef} [Privacy Implications of Connection Migration](#name-privacy-implications-of-con){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-privacy-implications-of-con}

Using a stable connection ID on multiple network paths would allow a
passive observer to correlate activity between those paths. An endpoint
that moves between networks might not wish to have their activity
correlated by any entity other than their peer, so different connection
IDs are used when sending from different local addresses, as discussed
in [Section 5.1](#connection-id){.xref}. For this to be effective,
endpoints need to ensure that connection IDs they provide cannot be
linked by any other entity.[¶](#section-9.5-1){.pilcrow}

At any time, endpoints [MAY]{.bcp14} change the Destination Connection
ID they transmit with to a value that has not been used on another
path.[¶](#section-9.5-2){.pilcrow}

An endpoint [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} reuse a connection ID when sending from
more than one local address \-- for example, when initiating connection
migration as described in [Section 9.2](#initiating-migration){.xref} or
when probing a new network path as described in [Section
9.1](#probing){.xref}.[¶](#section-9.5-3){.pilcrow}

Similarly, an endpoint [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} reuse a connection ID when
sending to more than one destination address. Due to network changes
outside the control of its peer, an endpoint might receive packets from
a new source address with the same Destination Connection ID field
value, in which case it [MAY]{.bcp14} continue to use the current
connection ID with the new remote address while still sending from the
same local address.[¶](#section-9.5-4){.pilcrow}

These requirements regarding connection ID reuse apply only to the
sending of packets, as unintentional changes in path without a change in
connection ID are possible. For example, after a period of network
inactivity, NAT rebinding might cause packets to be sent on a new path
when the client resumes sending. An endpoint responds to such an event
as described in [Section
9.3](#migration-response){.xref}.[¶](#section-9.5-5){.pilcrow}

Using different connection IDs for packets sent in both directions on
each new network path eliminates the use of the connection ID for
linking packets from the same connection across different network paths.
Header protection ensures that packet numbers cannot be used to
correlate activity. This does not prevent other properties of packets,
such as timing and size, from being used to correlate
activity.[¶](#section-9.5-6){.pilcrow}

An endpoint [SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} initiate migration with a peer that has
requested a zero-length connection ID, because traffic over the new path
might be trivially linkable to traffic over the old one. If the server
is able to associate packets with a zero-length connection ID to the
right connection, it means that the server is using other information to
demultiplex packets. For example, a server might provide a unique
address to every client \-- for instance, using HTTP alternative
services \[[ALTSVC](#ALTSVC){.xref}\]. Information that might allow
correct routing of packets across multiple network paths will also allow
activity on those paths to be linked by entities other than the
peer.[¶](#section-9.5-7){.pilcrow}

A client might wish to reduce linkability by switching to a new
connection ID, source UDP port, or IP address (see
\[[RFC8981](#RFC8981){.xref}\]) when sending traffic after a period of
inactivity. Changing the address from which it sends packets at the same
time might cause the server to detect a connection migration. This
ensures that the mechanisms that support migration are exercised even
for clients that do not experience NAT rebindings or genuine migrations.
Changing address can cause a peer to reset its congestion control state
(see [Section 9.4](#migration-cc){.xref}), so addresses [SHOULD]{.bcp14}
only be changed infrequently.[¶](#section-9.5-8){.pilcrow}

An endpoint that exhausts available connection IDs cannot probe new
paths or initiate migration, nor can it respond to probes or attempts by
its peer to migrate. To ensure that migration is possible and packets
sent on different paths cannot be correlated, endpoints [SHOULD]{.bcp14}
provide new connection IDs before peers migrate; see [Section
5.1.1](#issue-cid){.xref}. If a peer might have exhausted available
connection IDs, a migrating endpoint could include a NEW_CONNECTION_ID
frame in all packets sent on a new network
path.[¶](#section-9.5-9){.pilcrow}

the connection is silently closed and its state is discarded when it
remains idle for longer than the minimum of the max_idle_timeout value

Each endpoint advertises a max_idle_timeout, but the effective value at
an endpoint is computed as the minimum of the two advertised values (or
the sole advertised value, if only one endpoint advertises a non-zero
value). By announcing a max_idle_timeout, an endpoint commits to
initiating an immediate close ([Section 10.2](#immediate-close){.xref})
if it abandons the connection prior to the effective
value.[¶](#section-10.1-2){.pilcrow}

An endpoint restarts its idle timer when a packet from its peer is
received and processed successfully. An endpoint also restarts its idle
timer when sending an ack-eliciting packet if no other ack-eliciting
packets have been sent since last receiving and processing a packet.
Restarting this timer when sending a packet ensures that connections are
not closed after new activity is
initiated.[¶](#section-10.1-3){.pilcrow}

To avoid excessively small idle timeout periods, endpoints
[MUST]{.bcp14} increase the idle timeout period to be at least three

time. With this option, an endpoint could send a PING frame ([Section
19.2](#frame-ping){.xref}) periodically, which will cause the peer to
restart its idle timeout period. Sending a packet containing a PING
frame restarts the idle timeout for this endpoint also if this is the
first ack-eliciting packet sent since receiving a packet. Sending a PING
frame causes the peer to respond with an acknowledgment, which also
restarts the idle timeout for the
endpoint.[¶](#section-10.1.2-2){.pilcrow}

Application protocols that use QUIC [SHOULD]{.bcp14} provide guidance on
when deferring an idle timeout is appropriate. Unnecessary sending of
PING frames could have a detrimental effect on
performance.[¶](#section-10.1.2-3){.pilcrow}

A connection will time out if no packets are sent or received for a
period longer than the time negotiated using the max_idle_timeout
transport parameter; see [Section 10](#termination){.xref}. However,
state in middleboxes might time out earlier than that. Though REQ-5 in
\[[RFC4787](#RFC4787){.xref}\] recommends a 2-minute timeout interval,
experience shows that sending packets every 30 seconds is necessary to
prevent the majority of middleboxes from losing state for UDP flows

An endpoint sends a CONNECTION_CLOSE frame ([Section
19.19](#frame-connection-close){.xref}) to terminate the connection
immediately. A CONNECTION_CLOSE frame causes all streams to immediately
become closed; open streams can be assumed to be implicitly
reset.[¶](#section-10.2-1){.pilcrow}

After sending a CONNECTION_CLOSE frame, an endpoint immediately enters
the closing state; see [Section 10.2.1](#closing){.xref}. After
receiving a CONNECTION_CLOSE frame, endpoints enter the draining state;
see [Section 10.2.2](#draining){.xref}.[¶](#section-10.2-2){.pilcrow}

Violations of the protocol lead to an immediate
close.[¶](#section-10.2-3){.pilcrow}

An immediate close can be used after an application protocol has
arranged to close a connection. This might be after the application
protocol negotiates a graceful shutdown. The application protocol can
exchange messages that are needed for both application endpoints to
agree that the connection can be closed, after which the application
requests that QUIC close the connection. When QUIC consequently closes
the connection, a CONNECTION_CLOSE frame with an application-supplied
error code will be used to signal closure to the
peer.[¶](#section-10.2-4){.pilcrow}

The closing and draining connection states exist to ensure that
connections close cleanly and that delayed or reordered packets are
properly discarded. These states [SHOULD]{.bcp14} persist for at least
three times the current PTO interval as defined in
\[[QUIC-RECOVERY](#QUIC-RECOVERY){.xref}\].[¶](#section-10.2-5){.pilcrow}

Disposing of connection state prior to exiting the closing or draining
state could result in an endpoint generating a Stateless Reset
unnecessarily when it receives a late-arriving packet. Endpoints that
have some alternative means to ensure that late-arriving packets do not
induce a response, such as those that are able to close the UDP socket,
[MAY]{.bcp14} end these states earlier to allow for faster resource
recovery. Servers that retain an open socket for accepting new
connections [SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} end the closing or draining state
early.[¶](#section-10.2-6){.pilcrow}

Once its closing or draining state ends, an endpoint [SHOULD]{.bcp14}
discard all connection state. The endpoint [MAY]{.bcp14} send a
Stateless Reset in response to any further incoming packets belonging to
this connection.[¶](#section-10.2-7){.pilcrow}

An endpoint enters the closing state after initiating an immediate
close.[¶](#section-10.2.1-1){.pilcrow}

In the closing state, an endpoint retains only enough information to
generate a packet containing a CONNECTION_CLOSE frame and to identify
packets as belonging to the connection. An endpoint in the closing state
sends a packet containing a CONNECTION_CLOSE frame in response to any
incoming packet that it attributes to the
connection.[¶](#section-10.2.1-2){.pilcrow}

An endpoint [SHOULD]{.bcp14} limit the rate at which it generates
packets in the closing state. For instance, an endpoint could wait for a
progressively increasing number of received packets or amount of time
before responding to received packets.[¶](#section-10.2.1-3){.pilcrow}

An endpoint\'s selected connection ID and the QUIC version are
sufficient information to identify packets for a closing connection; the
endpoint [MAY]{.bcp14} discard all other connection state. An endpoint
that is closing is not required to process any received frame. An
endpoint [MAY]{.bcp14} retain packet protection keys for incoming
packets to allow it to read and process a CONNECTION_CLOSE
frame.[¶](#section-10.2.1-4){.pilcrow}

An endpoint [MAY]{.bcp14} drop packet protection keys when entering the
closing state and send a packet containing a CONNECTION_CLOSE frame in
response to any UDP datagram that is received. However, an endpoint that
discards packet protection keys cannot identify and discard invalid
packets. To avoid being used for an amplification attack, such endpoints
[MUST]{.bcp14} limit the cumulative size of packets it sends to three
times the cumulative size of the packets that are received and
attributed to the connection. To minimize the state that an endpoint
maintains for a closing connection, endpoints [MAY]{.bcp14} send the
exact same packet in response to any received
packet.[¶](#section-10.2.1-5){.pilcrow}

Note: Allowing retransmission of a closing packet is an exception to the
requirement that a new packet number be used for each packet; see
[Section 12.3](#packet-numbers){.xref}. Sending new packet numbers is
primarily of advantage to loss recovery and congestion control, which
are not expected to be relevant for a closed connection. Retransmitting
the final packet requires less state.[¶](#section-10.2.1-6.1){.pilcrow}

While in the closing state, an endpoint could receive packets from a new
source address, possibly indicating a connection migration; see [Section
9](#migration){.xref}. An endpoint in the closing state [MUST]{.bcp14}
either discard packets received from an unvalidated address or limit the
cumulative size of packets it sends to an unvalidated address to three
times the size of packets it receives from that
address.[¶](#section-10.2.1-7){.pilcrow}

An endpoint is not expected to handle key updates when it is closing
([Section 6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9001#section-6){.relref}
of \[[QUIC-TLS](#QUIC-TLS){.xref}\]). A key update might prevent the

When sending a CONNECTION_CLOSE frame, the goal is to ensure that the
peer will process the frame. Generally, this means sending the frame in
a packet with the highest level of packet protection to avoid the packet
being discarded. After the handshake is confirmed (see [Section
4.1.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9001#section-4.1.2){.relref} of
\[[QUIC-TLS](#QUIC-TLS){.xref}\]), an endpoint [MUST]{.bcp14} send any
CONNECTION_CLOSE frames in a 1-RTT packet. However, prior to confirming
the handshake, it is possible that more advanced packet protection keys
are not available to the peer, so another CONNECTION_CLOSE frame
[MAY]{.bcp14} be sent in a packet that uses a lower packet protection
level. More specifically:[¶](#section-10.2.3-1){.pilcrow}

-   [A client will always know whether the server has Handshake keys
    (see [Section 17.2.2.1](#discard-initial){.xref}), but it is
    possible that a server does not know whether the client has
    Handshake keys. Under these circumstances, a server [SHOULD]{.bcp14}
    send a CONNECTION_CLOSE frame in both Handshake and Initial packets
    to ensure that at least one of them is processable by the
    client.[¶](#section-10.2.3-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-10.2.3-2.1}
-   [A client that sends a CONNECTION_CLOSE frame in a 0-RTT packet
    cannot be assured that the server has accepted 0-RTT. Sending a
    CONNECTION_CLOSE frame in an Initial packet makes it more likely
    that the server can receive the close signal, even if the
    application error code might not be
    received.[¶](#section-10.2.3-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-10.2.3-2.2}
-   [Prior to confirming the handshake, a peer might be unable to

    [SHOULD]{.bcp14} also send a CONNECTION_CLOSE frame in an Initial
    packet.[¶](#section-10.2.3-2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-10.2.3-2.3}

Sending a CONNECTION_CLOSE of type 0x1d in an Initial or Handshake
packet could expose application state or be used to alter application
state. A CONNECTION_CLOSE of type 0x1d [MUST]{.bcp14} be replaced by a
CONNECTION_CLOSE of type 0x1c when sending the frame in Initial or
Handshake packets. Otherwise, information about the application state
might be revealed. Endpoints [MUST]{.bcp14} clear the value of the
Reason Phrase field and [SHOULD]{.bcp14} use the APPLICATION_ERROR code
when converting to a CONNECTION_CLOSE of type
0x1c.[¶](#section-10.2.3-3){.pilcrow}

CONNECTION_CLOSE frames sent in multiple packet types can be coalesced
into a single UDP datagram; see [Section
12.2](#packet-coalesce){.xref}.[¶](#section-10.2.3-4){.pilcrow}

An endpoint can send a CONNECTION_CLOSE frame in an Initial packet. This
might be in response to unauthenticated information received in Initial
or Handshake packets. Such an immediate close might expose legitimate
connections to a denial of service. QUIC does not include defensive
measures for on-path attacks during the handshake; see [Section
21.2](#handshake-dos){.xref}. However, at the cost of reducing feedback
about errors for legitimate peers, some forms of denial of service can
be made more difficult for an attacker if endpoints discard illegal
packets rather than terminating a connection with CONNECTION_CLOSE. For
this reason, endpoints [MAY]{.bcp14} discard packets rather than
immediately close if errors are detected in packets that lack
authentication.[¶](#section-10.2.3-5){.pilcrow}

An endpoint that has not established state, such as a server that
detects an error in an Initial packet, does not enter the closing state.

### [10.3.](#section-10.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Stateless Reset](#name-stateless-reset){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-stateless-reset}

A stateless reset is provided as an option of last resort for an
endpoint that does not have access to the state of a connection. A crash
or outage might result in peers continuing to send data to an endpoint
that is unable to properly continue the connection. An endpoint
[MAY]{.bcp14} send a Stateless Reset in response to receiving a packet
that it cannot associate with an active
connection.[¶](#section-10.3-1){.pilcrow}

A stateless reset is not appropriate for indicating errors in active
connections. An endpoint that wishes to communicate a fatal connection
error [MUST]{.bcp14} use a CONNECTION_CLOSE frame if it is
able.[¶](#section-10.3-2){.pilcrow}

To support this process, an endpoint issues a stateless reset token,
which is a 16-byte value that is hard to guess. If the peer subsequently
receives a Stateless Reset, which is a UDP datagram that ends in that
stateless reset token, the peer will immediately end the
connection.[¶](#section-10.3-3){.pilcrow}

A stateless reset token is specific to a connection ID. An endpoint
issues a stateless reset token by including the value in the Stateless
Reset Token field of a NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame. Servers can also issue a
stateless_reset_token transport parameter during the handshake that
applies to the connection ID that it selected during the handshake.
These exchanges are protected by encryption, so only client and server
know their value. Note that clients cannot use the stateless_reset_token
transport parameter because their transport parameters do not have
confidentiality protection.[¶](#section-10.3-4){.pilcrow}

Tokens are invalidated when their associated connection ID is retired
via a RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frame ([Section
19.16](#frame-retire-connection-id){.xref}).[¶](#section-10.3-5){.pilcrow}

An endpoint that receives packets that it cannot process sends a packet
in the following layout (see [Section
1.3](#notation){.xref}):[¶](#section-10.3-6){.pilcrow}

:::

This design ensures that a Stateless Reset is \-- to the extent possible
\-- indistinguishable from a regular packet with a short
header.[¶](#section-10.3-8){.pilcrow}

A Stateless Reset uses an entire UDP datagram, starting with the first
two bits of the packet header. The remainder of the first byte and an
arbitrary number of bytes following it are set to values that
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} be indistinguishable from random. The last 16 bytes of
the datagram contain a stateless reset
token.[¶](#section-10.3-9){.pilcrow}

To entities other than its intended recipient, a Stateless Reset will
appear to be a packet with a short header. For the Stateless Reset to
appear as a valid QUIC packet, the Unpredictable Bits field needs to
include at least 38 bits of data (or 5 bytes, less the two fixed
bits).[¶](#section-10.3-10){.pilcrow}

The resulting minimum size of 21 bytes does not guarantee that a
Stateless Reset is difficult to distinguish from other packets if the
recipient requires the use of a connection ID. To achieve that end, the
endpoint [SHOULD]{.bcp14} ensure that all packets it sends are at least
22 bytes longer than the minimum connection ID length that it requests
the peer to include in its packets, adding PADDING frames as necessary.
This ensures that any Stateless Reset sent by the peer is
indistinguishable from a valid packet sent to the endpoint. An endpoint
that sends a Stateless Reset in response to a packet that is 43 bytes or
shorter [SHOULD]{.bcp14} send a Stateless Reset that is one byte shorter
than the packet it responds to.[¶](#section-10.3-11){.pilcrow}

These values assume that the stateless reset token is the same length as
the minimum expansion of the packet protection AEAD. Additional
unpredictable bytes are necessary if the endpoint could have negotiated
a packet protection scheme with a larger minimum
expansion.[¶](#section-10.3-12){.pilcrow}

An endpoint [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} send a Stateless Reset that is three
times or more larger than the packet it receives to avoid being used for
amplification. [Section 10.3.3](#reset-looping){.xref} describes
additional limits on Stateless Reset
size.[¶](#section-10.3-13){.pilcrow}

Endpoints [MUST]{.bcp14} discard packets that are too small to be valid
QUIC packets. To give an example, with the set of AEAD functions defined
in \[[QUIC-TLS](#QUIC-TLS){.xref}\], short header packets that are
smaller than 21 bytes are never valid.[¶](#section-10.3-14){.pilcrow}

Endpoints [MUST]{.bcp14} send Stateless Resets formatted as a packet
with a short header. However, endpoints [MUST]{.bcp14} treat any packet
ending in a valid stateless reset token as a Stateless Reset, as other
QUIC versions might allow the use of a long
header.[¶](#section-10.3-15){.pilcrow}

An endpoint [MAY]{.bcp14} send a Stateless Reset in response to a packet
with a long header. Sending a Stateless Reset is not effective prior to
the stateless reset token being available to a peer. In this QUIC
version, packets with a long header are only used during connection
establishment. Because the stateless reset token is not available until
connection establishment is complete or near completion, ignoring an
unknown packet with a long header might be as effective as sending a
Stateless Reset.[¶](#section-10.3-16){.pilcrow}

An endpoint cannot determine the Source Connection ID from a packet with
a short header; therefore, it cannot set the Destination Connection ID
in the Stateless Reset. The Destination Connection ID will therefore
differ from the value used in previous packets. A random Destination
Connection ID makes the connection ID appear to be the result of moving
to a new connection ID that was provided using a NEW_CONNECTION_ID
frame; see [Section
19.15](#frame-new-connection-id){.xref}.[¶](#section-10.3-17){.pilcrow}

Using a randomized connection ID results in two
problems:[¶](#section-10.3-18){.pilcrow}

-   [The packet might not reach the peer. If the Destination Connection
    ID is critical for routing toward the peer, then this packet could
    be incorrectly routed. This might also trigger another Stateless
    Reset in response; see [Section 10.3.3](#reset-looping){.xref}. A
    Stateless Reset that is not correctly routed is an ineffective error
    detection and recovery mechanism. In this case, endpoints will need
    to rely on other methods \-- such as timers \-- to detect that the
    connection has
    failed.[¶](#section-10.3-19.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-10.3-19.1}
-   [The randomly generated connection ID can be used by entities other
    than the peer to identify this as a potential Stateless Reset. An
    endpoint that occasionally uses different connection IDs might
    introduce some uncertainty about
    this.[¶](#section-10.3-19.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-10.3-19.2}

This stateless reset design is specific to QUIC version 1. An endpoint
that supports multiple versions of QUIC needs to generate a Stateless
Reset that will be accepted by peers that support any version that the
endpoint might support (or might have supported prior to losing state).
Designers of new versions of QUIC need to be aware of this and either
(1) reuse this design or (2) use a portion of the packet other than the
last 16 bytes for carrying data.[¶](#section-10.3-20){.pilcrow}

An endpoint detects a potential Stateless Reset using the trailing 16
bytes of the UDP datagram. An endpoint remembers all stateless reset
tokens associated with the connection IDs and remote addresses for
datagrams it has recently sent. This includes Stateless Reset Token
field values from NEW_CONNECTION_ID frames and the server\'s transport
parameters but excludes stateless reset tokens associated with
connection IDs that are either unused or retired. The endpoint
identifies a received datagram as a Stateless Reset by comparing the
last 16 bytes of the datagram with all stateless reset tokens associated
with the remote address on which the datagram was
received.[¶](#section-10.3.1-1){.pilcrow}

This comparison can be performed for every inbound datagram. Endpoints
[MAY]{.bcp14} skip this check if any packet from a datagram is
successfully processed. However, the comparison [MUST]{.bcp14} be
performed when the first packet in an incoming datagram either cannot be
associated with a connection or cannot be
decrypted.[¶](#section-10.3.1-2){.pilcrow}

An endpoint [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} check for any stateless reset tokens
associated with connection IDs it has not used or for connection IDs
that have been retired.[¶](#section-10.3.1-3){.pilcrow}

When comparing a datagram to stateless reset token values, endpoints
[MUST]{.bcp14} perform the comparison without leaking information about
the value of the token. For example, performing this comparison in
constant time protects the value of individual stateless reset tokens
from information leakage through timing side channels. Another approach
would be to store and compare the transformed values of stateless reset
tokens instead of the raw token values, where the transformation is
defined as a cryptographically secure pseudorandom function using a
secret key (e.g., block cipher, Hashed Message Authentication Code
(HMAC) \[[RFC2104](#RFC2104){.xref}\]). An endpoint is not expected to
protect information about whether a packet was successfully decrypted or
the number of valid stateless reset
tokens.[¶](#section-10.3.1-4){.pilcrow}

If the last 16 bytes of the datagram are identical in value to a

The stateless reset token [MUST]{.bcp14} be difficult to guess. In order
to create a stateless reset token, an endpoint could randomly generate
\[[RANDOM](#RANDOM){.xref}\] a secret for every connection that it
creates. However, this presents a coordination problem when there are
multiple instances in a cluster or a storage problem for an endpoint
that might lose state. Stateless reset specifically exists to handle the
case where state is lost, so this approach is
suboptimal.[¶](#section-10.3.2-1){.pilcrow}

A single static key can be used across all connections to the same
endpoint by generating the proof using a pseudorandom function that
takes a static key and the connection ID chosen by the endpoint (see
[Section 5.1](#connection-id){.xref}) as input. An endpoint could use
HMAC \[[RFC2104](#RFC2104){.xref}\] (for example, HMAC(static_key,
connection_id)) or the HMAC-based Key Derivation Function (HKDF)
\[[RFC5869](#RFC5869){.xref}\] (for example, using the static key as
input keying material, with the connection ID as salt). The output of
this function is truncated to 16 bytes to produce the stateless reset
token for that connection.[¶](#section-10.3.2-2){.pilcrow}

An endpoint that loses state can use the same method to generate a valid
stateless reset token. The connection ID comes from the packet that the
endpoint receives.[¶](#section-10.3.2-3){.pilcrow}

This design relies on the peer always sending a connection ID in its
packets so that the endpoint can use the connection ID from a packet to
reset the connection. An endpoint that uses this design [MUST]{.bcp14}
either use the same connection ID length for all connections or encode
the length of the connection ID such that it can be recovered without
state. In addition, it cannot provide a zero-length connection
ID.[¶](#section-10.3.2-4){.pilcrow}

Revealing the stateless reset token allows any entity to terminate the
connection, so a value can only be used once. This method for choosing
the stateless reset token means that the combination of connection ID
and static key [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be used for another connection. A
denial-of-service attack is possible if the same connection ID is used
by instances that share a static key or if an attacker can cause a
packet to be routed to an instance that has no state but the same static
key; see [Section 21.11](#reset-oracle){.xref}. A connection ID from a
connection that is reset by revealing the stateless reset token [MUST
NOT]{.bcp14} be reused for new connections at nodes that share a static
key.[¶](#section-10.3.2-5){.pilcrow}

The same stateless reset token [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be used for multiple

all previous values, but a duplicate value [MAY]{.bcp14} be treated as a

The design of a Stateless Reset is such that without knowing the
stateless reset token it is indistinguishable from a valid packet. For
instance, if a server sends a Stateless Reset to another server, it
might receive another Stateless Reset in response, which could lead to
an infinite exchange.[¶](#section-10.3.3-1){.pilcrow}

An endpoint [MUST]{.bcp14} ensure that every Stateless Reset that it

state sufficient to prevent looping. In the event of a loop, this
results in packets eventually being too small to trigger a
response.[¶](#section-10.3.3-2){.pilcrow}

An endpoint can remember the number of Stateless Resets that it has sent
and stop generating new Stateless Resets once a limit is reached. Using
separate limits for different remote addresses will ensure that
Stateless Resets can be used to close connections when other peers or
connections have exhausted limits.[¶](#section-10.3.3-3){.pilcrow}

A Stateless Reset that is smaller than 41 bytes might be identifiable as
a Stateless Reset by an observer, depending upon the length of the

The most appropriate error code ([Section 20](#error-codes){.xref})
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} be included in the frame that signals the error. Where
this specification identifies error conditions, it also identifies the
error code that is used; though these are worded as requirements,
different implementation strategies might lead to different errors being
reported. In particular, an endpoint [MAY]{.bcp14} use any applicable
error code when it detects an error condition; a generic error code
(such as PROTOCOL_VIOLATION or INTERNAL_ERROR) can always be used in
place of specific error codes.[¶](#section-11-2){.pilcrow}

A stateless reset ([Section 10.3](#stateless-reset){.xref}) is not
suitable for any error that can be signaled with a CONNECTION_CLOSE or
RESET_STREAM frame. A stateless reset [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be used by an
endpoint that has the state necessary to send a frame on the
connection.[¶](#section-11-3){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-11.1 .section}
### [11.1.](#section-11.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Connection Errors](#name-connection-errors){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-connection-errors}

Errors that result in the connection being unusable, such as an obvious
violation of protocol semantics or corruption of state that affects an
entire connection, [MUST]{.bcp14} be signaled using a CONNECTION_CLOSE
frame ([Section
19.19](#frame-connection-close){.xref}).[¶](#section-11.1-1){.pilcrow}

Application-specific protocol errors are signaled using the
CONNECTION_CLOSE frame with a frame type of 0x1d. Errors that are
specific to the transport, including all those described in this
document, are carried in the CONNECTION_CLOSE frame with a frame type of
0x1c.[¶](#section-11.1-2){.pilcrow}

A CONNECTION_CLOSE frame could be sent in a packet that is lost. An
endpoint [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be prepared to retransmit a packet containing
a CONNECTION_CLOSE frame if it receives more packets on a terminated
connection. Limiting the number of retransmissions and the time over
which this final packet is sent limits the effort expended on terminated
connections.[¶](#section-11.1-3){.pilcrow}

An endpoint that chooses not to retransmit packets containing a
CONNECTION_CLOSE frame risks a peer missing the first such packet. The
only mechanism available to an endpoint that continues to receive data
for a terminated connection is to attempt the stateless reset process
([Section 10.3](#stateless-reset){.xref}).[¶](#section-11.1-4){.pilcrow}

As the AEAD for Initial packets does not provide strong authentication,
an endpoint [MAY]{.bcp14} discard an invalid Initial packet. Discarding
an Initial packet is permitted even where this specification otherwise
mandates a connection error. An endpoint can only discard a packet if it
does not process the frames in the packet or reverts the effects of any
processing. Discarding invalid Initial packets might be used to reduce
exposure to denial of service; see [Section
21.2](#handshake-dos){.xref}.[¶](#section-11.1-5){.pilcrow}

### [11.2.](#section-11.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Stream Errors](#name-stream-errors){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-stream-errors}

If an application-level error affects a single stream but otherwise
leaves the connection in a recoverable state, the endpoint can send a
RESET_STREAM frame ([Section 19.4](#frame-reset-stream){.xref}) with an
appropriate error code to terminate just the affected
stream.[¶](#section-11.2-1){.pilcrow}

Resetting a stream without the involvement of the application protocol
could cause the application protocol to enter an unrecoverable state.
RESET_STREAM [MUST]{.bcp14} only be instigated by the application
protocol that uses QUIC.[¶](#section-11.2-2){.pilcrow}

The semantics of the application error code carried in RESET_STREAM are
defined by the application protocol. Only the application protocol is
able to cause a stream to be terminated. A local instance of the
application protocol uses a direct API call, and a remote instance uses
the STOP_SENDING frame, which triggers an automatic
RESET_STREAM.[¶](#section-11.2-3){.pilcrow}

Application protocols [SHOULD]{.bcp14} define rules for handling streams
that are prematurely canceled by either
endpoint.[¶](#section-11.2-4){.pilcrow}

## [12.](#section-12){.section-number .selfRef} [Packets and Frames](#name-packets-and-frames){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-packets-and-frames}

QUIC endpoints communicate by exchanging packets. Packets have
confidentiality and integrity protection; see [Section
12.1](#packet-protected){.xref}. Packets are carried in UDP datagrams;
see [Section 12.2](#packet-coalesce){.xref}.[¶](#section-12-1){.pilcrow}

This version of QUIC uses the long packet header during connection
establishment; see [Section 17.2](#long-header){.xref}. Packets with the
long header are Initial ([Section 17.2.2](#packet-initial){.xref}),
0-RTT ([Section 17.2.3](#packet-0rtt){.xref}), Handshake ([Section
17.2.4](#packet-handshake){.xref}), and Retry ([Section
17.2.5](#packet-retry){.xref}). Version negotiation uses a
version-independent packet with a long header; see [Section
17.2.1](#packet-version){.xref}.[¶](#section-12-2){.pilcrow}

Packets with the short header are designed for minimal overhead and are
used after a connection is established and 1-RTT keys are available; see
[Section 17.3](#short-header){.xref}.[¶](#section-12-3){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-12.1 .section}
### [12.1.](#section-12.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Protected Packets](#name-protected-packets){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-protected-packets}

QUIC packets have different levels of cryptographic protection based on
the type of packet. Details of packet protection are found in
\[[QUIC-TLS](#QUIC-TLS){.xref}\]; this section includes an overview of
the protections that are provided.[¶](#section-12.1-1){.pilcrow}

Version Negotiation packets have no cryptographic protection; see
\[[QUIC-INVARIANTS](#QUIC-INVARIANTS){.xref}\].[¶](#section-12.1-2){.pilcrow}

Retry packets use an AEAD function \[[AEAD](#AEAD){.xref}\] to protect
against accidental modification.[¶](#section-12.1-3){.pilcrow}

Initial packets use an AEAD function, the keys for which are derived
using a value that is visible on the wire. Initial packets therefore do
not have effective confidentiality protection. Initial protection exists
to ensure that the sender of the packet is on the network path. Any
entity that receives an Initial packet from a client can recover the
keys that will allow them to both read the contents of the packet and
generate Initial packets that will be successfully authenticated at
either endpoint. The AEAD also protects Initial packets against
accidental modification.[¶](#section-12.1-4){.pilcrow}

All other packets are protected with keys derived from the cryptographic
handshake. The cryptographic handshake ensures that only the
communicating endpoints receive the corresponding keys for Handshake,
0-RTT, and 1-RTT packets. Packets protected with 0-RTT and 1-RTT keys
have strong confidentiality and integrity
protection.[¶](#section-12.1-5){.pilcrow}

The Packet Number field that appears in some packet types has
alternative confidentiality protection that is applied as part of header
protection; see [Section
5.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9001#section-5.4){.relref} of
\[[QUIC-TLS](#QUIC-TLS){.xref}\] for details. The underlying packet
number increases with each packet sent in a given packet number space;

details.[¶](#section-12.1-6){.pilcrow}

### [12.2.](#section-12.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Coalescing Packets](#name-coalescing-packets){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-coalescing-packets}

Initial ([Section 17.2.2](#packet-initial){.xref}), 0-RTT ([Section
17.2.3](#packet-0rtt){.xref}), and Handshake ([Section
17.2.4](#packet-handshake){.xref}) packets contain a Length field that
determines the end of the packet. The length includes both the Packet
Number and Payload fields, both of which are confidentiality protected
and initially of unknown length. The length of the Payload field is
learned once header protection is removed.[¶](#section-12.2-1){.pilcrow}

Using the Length field, a sender can coalesce multiple QUIC packets into
one UDP datagram. This can reduce the number of UDP datagrams needed to
complete the cryptographic handshake and start sending data. This can
also be used to construct Path Maximum Transmission Unit (PMTU) probes;
see [Section 14.4.1](#pmtu-probes-src-cid){.xref}. Receivers
[MUST]{.bcp14} be able to process coalesced
packets.[¶](#section-12.2-2){.pilcrow}

Coalescing packets in order of increasing encryption levels (Initial,
0-RTT, Handshake, 1-RTT; see [Section
4.1.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9001#section-4.1.4){.relref} of
\[[QUIC-TLS](#QUIC-TLS){.xref}\]) makes it more likely that the receiver
will be able to process all the packets in a single pass. A packet with
a short header does not include a length, so it can only be the last
packet included in a UDP datagram. An endpoint [SHOULD]{.bcp14} include
multiple frames in a single packet if they are to be sent at the same
encryption level, instead of coalescing multiple packets at the same
encryption level.[¶](#section-12.2-3){.pilcrow}

Receivers [MAY]{.bcp14} route based on the information in the first
packet contained in a UDP datagram. Senders [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} coalesce
QUIC packets with different connection IDs into a single UDP datagram.
Receivers [SHOULD]{.bcp14} ignore any subsequent packets with a
different Destination Connection ID than the first packet in the
datagram.[¶](#section-12.2-4){.pilcrow}

Every QUIC packet that is coalesced into a single UDP datagram is
separate and complete. The receiver of coalesced QUIC packets
[MUST]{.bcp14} individually process each QUIC packet and separately
acknowledge them, as if they were received as the payload of different
UDP datagrams. For example, if decryption fails (because the keys are
not available or for any other reason), the receiver [MAY]{.bcp14}
either discard or buffer the packet for later processing and
[MUST]{.bcp14} attempt to process the remaining
packets.[¶](#section-12.2-5){.pilcrow}

Retry packets ([Section 17.2.5](#packet-retry){.xref}), Version
Negotiation packets ([Section 17.2.1](#packet-version){.xref}), and
packets with a short header ([Section 17.3](#short-header){.xref}) do
not contain a Length field and so cannot be followed by other packets in
the same UDP datagram. Note also that there is no situation where a
Retry or Version Negotiation packet is coalesced with another
packet.[¶](#section-12.2-6){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-12.3 .section}
### [12.3.](#section-12.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Packet Numbers](#name-packet-numbers){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-packet-numbers}

The packet number is an integer in the range 0 to 2^62^-1. This number
is used in determining the cryptographic nonce for packet protection.
Each endpoint maintains a separate packet number for sending and
receiving.[¶](#section-12.3-1){.pilcrow}

Packet numbers are limited to this range because they need to be
representable in whole in the Largest Acknowledged field of an ACK frame
([Section 19.3](#frame-ack){.xref}). When present in a long or short
header, however, packet numbers are reduced and encoded in 1 to 4 bytes;
see [Section
17.1](#packet-encoding){.xref}.[¶](#section-12.3-2){.pilcrow}

Version Negotiation ([Section 17.2.1](#packet-version){.xref}) and Retry
([Section 17.2.5](#packet-retry){.xref}) packets do not include a packet
number.[¶](#section-12.3-3){.pilcrow}

Packet numbers are divided into three spaces in
QUIC:[¶](#section-12.3-4){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

Initial space:

:   All Initial packets ([Section 17.2.2](#packet-initial){.xref}) are
    in this space.[¶](#section-12.3-5.2.1){.pilcrow}

:   

Handshake space:

:   All Handshake packets ([Section 17.2.4](#packet-handshake){.xref})
    are in this space.[¶](#section-12.3-5.4.1){.pilcrow}

:   

Application data space:

:   All 0-RTT ([Section 17.2.3](#packet-0rtt){.xref}) and 1-RTT
    ([Section 17.3.1](#packet-1rtt){.xref}) packets are in this
    space.[¶](#section-12.3-5.6.1){.pilcrow}

:   

As described in \[[QUIC-TLS](#QUIC-TLS){.xref}\], each packet type uses
different protection keys.[¶](#section-12.3-6){.pilcrow}

Conceptually, a packet number space is the context in which a packet can
be processed and acknowledged. Initial packets can only be sent with
Initial packet protection keys and acknowledged in packets that are also
Initial packets. Similarly, Handshake packets are sent at the Handshake
encryption level and can only be acknowledged in Handshake
packets.[¶](#section-12.3-7){.pilcrow}

This enforces cryptographic separation between the data sent in the
different packet number spaces. Packet numbers in each space start at
packet number 0. Subsequent packets sent in the same packet number space
[MUST]{.bcp14} increase the packet number by at least
one.[¶](#section-12.3-8){.pilcrow}

0-RTT and 1-RTT data exist in the same packet number space to make loss
recovery algorithms easier to implement between the two packet
types.[¶](#section-12.3-9){.pilcrow}

A QUIC endpoint [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} reuse a packet number within the same
packet number space in one connection. If the packet number for sending
reaches 2^62^-1, the sender [MUST]{.bcp14} close the connection without
sending a CONNECTION_CLOSE frame or any further packets; an endpoint
[MAY]{.bcp14} send a Stateless Reset ([Section
10.3](#stateless-reset){.xref}) in response to further packets that it
receives.[¶](#section-12.3-10){.pilcrow}

A receiver [MUST]{.bcp14} discard a newly unprotected packet unless it
is certain that it has not processed another packet with the same packet
number from the same packet number space. Duplicate suppression
[MUST]{.bcp14} happen after removing packet protection for the reasons
described in [Section
9.5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9001#section-9.5){.relref} of
\[[QUIC-TLS](#QUIC-TLS){.xref}\].[¶](#section-12.3-11){.pilcrow}

Endpoints that track all individual packets for the purposes of
detecting duplicates are at risk of accumulating excessive state. The
data required for detecting duplicates can be limited by maintaining a
minimum packet number below which all packets are immediately dropped.
Any minimum needs to account for large variations in round-trip time,
which includes the possibility that a peer might probe network paths
with much larger round-trip times; see [Section
9](#migration){.xref}.[¶](#section-12.3-12){.pilcrow}

All frames are idempotent in this version of QUIC. That is, a valid

The Frame Type field uses a variable-length integer encoding (see
[Section 16](#integer-encoding){.xref}), with one exception. To ensure
simple and efficient implementations of frame parsing, a frame type
[MUST]{.bcp14} use the shortest possible encoding. For frame types
defined in this document, this means a single-byte encoding, even though
it is possible to encode these values as a two-, four-, or eight-byte
variable-length integer. For instance, though 0x4001 is a legitimate
two-byte encoding for a variable-length integer with a value of 1, PING
frames are always encoded as a single byte with the value 0x01. This
rule applies to all current and future QUIC frame types. An endpoint

A sender sends one or more frames in a QUIC packet; see [Section
12.4](#frames){.xref}.[¶](#section-13-1){.pilcrow}

A sender can minimize per-packet bandwidth and computational costs by
including as many frames as possible in each QUIC packet. A sender
[MAY]{.bcp14} wait for a short period of time to collect multiple frames
before sending a packet that is not maximally packed, to avoid sending
out large numbers of small packets. An implementation [MAY]{.bcp14} use
knowledge about application sending behavior or heuristics to determine
whether and for how long to wait. This waiting period is an
implementation decision, and an implementation should be careful to
delay conservatively, since any delay is likely to increase
application-visible latency.[¶](#section-13-2){.pilcrow}

Stream multiplexing is achieved by interleaving STREAM frames from
multiple streams into one or more QUIC packets. A single QUIC packet can
include multiple STREAM frames from one or more
streams.[¶](#section-13-3){.pilcrow}

One of the benefits of QUIC is avoidance of head-of-line blocking across
multiple streams. When a packet loss occurs, only streams with data in
that packet are blocked waiting for a retransmission to be received,
while other streams can continue making progress. Note that when data
from multiple streams is included in a single QUIC packet, loss of that
packet blocks all those streams from making progress. Implementations
are advised to include as few streams as necessary in outgoing packets
without losing transmission efficiency to underfilled
packets.[¶](#section-13-4){.pilcrow}

A packet [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be acknowledged until packet protection has
been successfully removed and all frames contained in the packet have
been processed. For STREAM frames, this means the data has been enqueued
in preparation to be received by the application protocol, but it does
not require that data be delivered and
consumed.[¶](#section-13.1-1){.pilcrow}

Once the packet has been fully processed, a receiver acknowledges
receipt by sending one or more ACK frames containing the packet number
of the received packet.[¶](#section-13.1-2){.pilcrow}

An endpoint [SHOULD]{.bcp14} treat receipt of an acknowledgment for a
packet it did not send as a connection error of type PROTOCOL_VIOLATION,

Endpoints acknowledge all packets they receive and process. However,
only ack-eliciting packets cause an ACK frame to be sent within the
maximum ack delay. Packets that are not ack-eliciting are only
acknowledged when an ACK frame is sent for other
reasons.[¶](#section-13.2-1){.pilcrow}

When sending a packet for any reason, an endpoint [SHOULD]{.bcp14}
attempt to include an ACK frame if one has not been sent recently. Doing
so helps with timely loss detection at the
peer.[¶](#section-13.2-2){.pilcrow}

In general, frequent feedback from a receiver improves loss and
congestion response, but this has to be balanced against excessive load
generated by a receiver that sends an ACK frame in response to every
ack-eliciting packet. The guidance offered below seeks to strike this
balance.[¶](#section-13.2-3){.pilcrow}

::: {#sending-acknowledgments}

#### [13.2.1.](#section-13.2.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Sending ACK Frames](#name-sending-ack-frames){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-sending-ack-frames}

Every packet [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be acknowledged at least once, and
ack-eliciting packets [MUST]{.bcp14} be acknowledged at least once
within the maximum delay an endpoint communicated using the
max_ack_delay transport parameter; see [Section
18.2](#transport-parameter-definitions){.xref}. max_ack_delay declares
an explicit contract: an endpoint promises to never intentionally delay
acknowledgments of an ack-eliciting packet by more than the indicated
value. If it does, any excess accrues to the RTT estimate and could
result in spurious or delayed retransmissions from the peer. A sender
uses the receiver\'s max_ack_delay value in determining timeouts for
timer-based retransmission, as detailed in [Section
6.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9002#section-6.2){.relref} of
\[[QUIC-RECOVERY](#QUIC-RECOVERY){.xref}\].[¶](#section-13.2.1-1){.pilcrow}

An endpoint [MUST]{.bcp14} acknowledge all ack-eliciting Initial and
Handshake packets immediately and all ack-eliciting 0-RTT and 1-RTT
packets within its advertised max_ack_delay, with the following
exception. Prior to handshake confirmation, an endpoint might not have
packet protection keys for decrypting Handshake, 0-RTT, or 1-RTT packets
when they are received. It might therefore buffer them and acknowledge
them when the requisite keys become
available.[¶](#section-13.2.1-2){.pilcrow}

Since packets containing only ACK frames are not congestion controlled,
an endpoint [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} send more than one such packet in
response to receiving an ack-eliciting
packet.[¶](#section-13.2.1-3){.pilcrow}

An endpoint [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} send a non-ack-eliciting packet in
response to a non-ack-eliciting packet, even if there are packet gaps
that precede the received packet. This avoids an infinite feedback loop
of acknowledgments, which could prevent the connection from ever
becoming idle. Non-ack-eliciting packets are eventually acknowledged
when the endpoint sends an ACK frame in response to other
events.[¶](#section-13.2.1-4){.pilcrow}

An endpoint that is only sending ACK frames will not receive
acknowledgments from its peer unless those acknowledgments are included
in packets with ack-eliciting frames. An endpoint [SHOULD]{.bcp14} send
an ACK frame with other frames when there are new ack-eliciting packets
to acknowledge. When only non-ack-eliciting packets need to be
acknowledged, an endpoint [MAY]{.bcp14} choose not to send an ACK frame
with outgoing frames until an ack-eliciting packet has been
received.[¶](#section-13.2.1-5){.pilcrow}

An endpoint that is only sending non-ack-eliciting packets might choose
to occasionally add an ack-eliciting frame to those packets to ensure
that it receives an acknowledgment; see [Section
13.2.4](#ack-tracking){.xref}. In that case, an endpoint [MUST
NOT]{.bcp14} send an ack-eliciting frame in all packets that would
otherwise be non-ack-eliciting, to avoid an infinite feedback loop of
acknowledgments.[¶](#section-13.2.1-6){.pilcrow}

In order to assist loss detection at the sender, an endpoint
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} generate and send an ACK frame without delay when it
receives an ack-eliciting packet either:[¶](#section-13.2.1-7){.pilcrow}

-   [when the received packet has a packet number less than another
    ack-eliciting packet that has been received,
    or[¶](#section-13.2.1-8.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-13.2.1-8.1}
-   [when the packet has a packet number larger than the
    highest-numbered ack-eliciting packet that has been received and
    there are missing packets between that packet and this
    packet.[¶](#section-13.2.1-8.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-13.2.1-8.2}

Similarly, packets marked with the ECN Congestion Experienced (CE)
codepoint in the IP header [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be acknowledged immediately,
to reduce the peer\'s response time to congestion
events.[¶](#section-13.2.1-9){.pilcrow}

The algorithms in \[[QUIC-RECOVERY](#QUIC-RECOVERY){.xref}\] are
expected to be resilient to receivers that do not follow the guidance
offered above. However, an implementation should only deviate from these
requirements after careful consideration of the performance implications

A receiver determines how frequently to send acknowledgments in response
to ack-eliciting packets. This determination involves a
trade-off.[¶](#section-13.2.2-1){.pilcrow}

Endpoints rely on timely acknowledgment to detect loss; see [Section
6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9002#section-6){.relref} of
\[[QUIC-RECOVERY](#QUIC-RECOVERY){.xref}\]. Window-based congestion
controllers, such as the one described in [Section
7](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9002#section-7){.relref} of
\[[QUIC-RECOVERY](#QUIC-RECOVERY){.xref}\], rely on acknowledgments to
manage their congestion window. In both cases, delaying acknowledgments
can adversely affect performance.[¶](#section-13.2.2-2){.pilcrow}

On the other hand, reducing the frequency of packets that carry only
acknowledgments reduces packet transmission and processing cost at both
endpoints. It can improve connection throughput on severely asymmetric
links and reduce the volume of acknowledgment traffic using return path
capacity; see [Section
3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3449#section-3){.relref} of
\[[RFC3449](#RFC3449){.xref}\].[¶](#section-13.2.2-3){.pilcrow}

A receiver [SHOULD]{.bcp14} send an ACK frame after receiving at least
two ack-eliciting packets. This recommendation is general in nature and
consistent with recommendations for TCP endpoint behavior
\[[RFC5681](#RFC5681){.xref}\]. Knowledge of network conditions,
knowledge of the peer\'s congestion controller, or further research and
experimentation might suggest alternative acknowledgment strategies with
better performance characteristics.[¶](#section-13.2.2-4){.pilcrow}

When an ACK frame is sent, one or more ranges of acknowledged packets
are included. Including acknowledgments for older packets reduces the
chance of spurious retransmissions caused by losing previously sent ACK
frames, at the cost of larger ACK
frames.[¶](#section-13.2.3-1){.pilcrow}

ACK frames [SHOULD]{.bcp14} always acknowledge the most recently
received packets, and the more out of order the packets are, the more
important it is to send an updated ACK frame quickly, to prevent the
peer from declaring a packet as lost and spuriously retransmitting the
frames it contains. An ACK frame is expected to fit within a single QUIC
packet. If it does not, then older ranges (those with the smallest
packet numbers) are omitted.[¶](#section-13.2.3-2){.pilcrow}

A receiver limits the number of ACK Ranges ([Section
19.3.1](#ack-ranges){.xref}) it remembers and sends in ACK frames, both
to limit the size of ACK frames and to avoid resource exhaustion. After
receiving acknowledgments for an ACK frame, the receiver
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} stop tracking those acknowledged ACK Ranges. Senders
can expect acknowledgments for most packets, but QUIC does not guarantee
receipt of an acknowledgment for every packet that the receiver
processes.[¶](#section-13.2.3-3){.pilcrow}

It is possible that retaining many ACK Ranges could cause an ACK frame
to become too large. A receiver can discard unacknowledged ACK Ranges to
limit ACK frame size, at the cost of increased retransmissions from the
sender. This is necessary if an ACK frame would be too large to fit in a
packet. Receivers [MAY]{.bcp14} also limit ACK frame size further to
preserve space for other frames or to limit the capacity that
acknowledgments consume.[¶](#section-13.2.3-4){.pilcrow}

A receiver [MUST]{.bcp14} retain an ACK Range unless it can ensure that
it will not subsequently accept packets with numbers in that range.
Maintaining a minimum packet number that increases as ranges are
discarded is one way to achieve this with minimal
state.[¶](#section-13.2.3-5){.pilcrow}

Receivers can discard all ACK Ranges, but they [MUST]{.bcp14} retain the
largest packet number that has been successfully processed, as that is
used to recover packet numbers from subsequent packets; see [Section
17.1](#packet-encoding){.xref}.[¶](#section-13.2.3-6){.pilcrow}

A receiver [SHOULD]{.bcp14} include an ACK Range containing the largest
received packet number in every ACK frame. The Largest Acknowledged
field is used in ECN validation at a sender, and including a lower value
than what was included in a previous ACK frame could cause ECN to be
unnecessarily disabled; see [Section
13.4.2](#ecn-validation){.xref}.[¶](#section-13.2.3-7){.pilcrow}

[Section 13.2.4](#ack-tracking){.xref} describes an exemplary approach
for determining what packets to acknowledge in each ACK frame. Though
the goal of this algorithm is to generate an acknowledgment for every
packet that is processed, it is still possible for acknowledgments to be
lost.[¶](#section-13.2.3-8){.pilcrow}

When a packet containing an ACK frame is sent, the Largest Acknowledged
field in that frame can be saved. When a packet containing an ACK frame
is acknowledged, the receiver can stop acknowledging packets less than
or equal to the Largest Acknowledged field in the sent ACK
frame.[¶](#section-13.2.4-1){.pilcrow}

A receiver that sends only non-ack-eliciting packets, such as ACK
frames, might not receive an acknowledgment for a long period of time.
This could cause the receiver to maintain state for a large number of
ACK frames for a long period of time, and ACK frames it sends could be
unnecessarily large. In such a case, a receiver could send a PING or
other small ack-eliciting frame occasionally, such as once per round
trip, to elicit an ACK from the peer.[¶](#section-13.2.4-2){.pilcrow}

In cases without ACK frame loss, this algorithm allows for a minimum of
1 RTT of reordering. In cases with ACK frame loss and reordering, this
approach does not guarantee that every acknowledgment is seen by the
sender before it is no longer included in the ACK frame. Packets could
be received out of order, and all subsequent ACK frames containing them
could be lost. In this case, the loss recovery algorithm could cause
spurious retransmissions, but the sender will continue making forward
progress.[¶](#section-13.2.4-3){.pilcrow}

time the packet with the largest packet number is received and the time
an acknowledgment is sent. The endpoint encodes this acknowledgment
delay in the ACK Delay field of an ACK frame; see [Section

adjust for any intentional delays, which is important for getting a
better estimate of the path RTT when acknowledgments are
delayed.[¶](#section-13.2.5-1){.pilcrow}

A packet might be held in the OS kernel or elsewhere on the host before
being processed. An endpoint [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} include delays that it
does not control when populating the ACK Delay field in an ACK frame.
However, endpoints [SHOULD]{.bcp14} include buffering delays caused by
unavailability of decryption keys, since these delays can be large and

up-to-date information every time it sends a packet, it is not forbidden
to retransmit copies of frames from lost packets. A sender that
retransmits copies of frames needs to handle decreases in available
payload size due to changes in packet number length, connection ID
length, and path MTU. A receiver [MUST]{.bcp14} accept packets
containing an outdated frame, such as a MAX_DATA frame carrying a
smaller maximum data value than one found in an older
packet.[¶](#section-13.3-5){.pilcrow}

A sender [SHOULD]{.bcp14} avoid retransmitting information from packets
once they are acknowledged. This includes packets that are acknowledged
after being declared lost, which can happen in the presence of network
reordering. Doing so requires senders to retain information about
packets after they are declared lost. A sender can discard this
information after a period of time elapses that adequately allows for
reordering, such as a PTO ([Section
6.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9002#section-6.2){.relref} of
\[[QUIC-RECOVERY](#QUIC-RECOVERY){.xref}\]), or based on other events,
such as reaching a memory limit.[¶](#section-13.3-6){.pilcrow}

Upon detecting losses, a sender [MUST]{.bcp14} take appropriate
congestion control action. The details of loss detection and congestion
control are described in

### [13.4.](#section-13.4){.section-number .selfRef} [Explicit Congestion Notification](#name-explicit-congestion-notific){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-explicit-congestion-notific}

QUIC endpoints can use ECN \[[RFC3168](#RFC3168){.xref}\] to detect and
respond to network congestion. ECN allows an endpoint to set an
ECN-Capable Transport (ECT) codepoint in the ECN field of an IP packet.
A network node can then indicate congestion by setting the ECN-CE
codepoint in the ECN field instead of dropping the packet
\[[RFC8087](#RFC8087){.xref}\]. Endpoints react to reported congestion
by reducing their sending rate in response, as described in
\[[QUIC-RECOVERY](#QUIC-RECOVERY){.xref}\].[¶](#section-13.4-1){.pilcrow}

To enable ECN, a sending QUIC endpoint first determines whether a path
supports ECN marking and whether the peer reports the ECN values in
received IP headers; see [Section
13.4.2](#ecn-validation){.xref}.[¶](#section-13.4-2){.pilcrow}

#### [13.4.1.](#section-13.4.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Reporting ECN Counts](#name-reporting-ecn-counts){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-reporting-ecn-counts}

The use of ECN requires the receiving endpoint to read the ECN field
from an IP packet, which is not possible on all platforms. If an
endpoint does not implement ECN support or does not have access to
received ECN fields, it does not report ECN counts for packets it
receives.[¶](#section-13.4.1-1){.pilcrow}

Even if an endpoint does not set an ECT field in packets it sends, the
endpoint [MUST]{.bcp14} provide feedback about ECN markings it receives,
if these are accessible. Failing to report the ECN counts will cause the
sender to disable the use of ECN for this
connection.[¶](#section-13.4.1-2){.pilcrow}

On receiving an IP packet with an ECT(0), ECT(1), or ECN-CE codepoint,
an ECN-enabled endpoint accesses the ECN field and increases the
corresponding ECT(0), ECT(1), or ECN-CE count. These ECN counts are
included in subsequent ACK frames; see Sections
[13.2](#generating-acks){.xref} and
[19.3](#frame-ack){.xref}.[¶](#section-13.4.1-3){.pilcrow}

Each packet number space maintains separate acknowledgment state and
separate ECN counts. Coalesced QUIC packets (see [Section
12.2](#packet-coalesce){.xref}) share the same IP header so the ECN
counts are incremented once for each coalesced QUIC
packet.[¶](#section-13.4.1-4){.pilcrow}

For example, if one each of an Initial, Handshake, and 1-RTT QUIC packet
are coalesced into a single UDP datagram, the ECN counts for all three
packet number spaces will be incremented by one each, based on the ECN
field of the single IP header.[¶](#section-13.4.1-5){.pilcrow}

ECN counts are only incremented when QUIC packets from the received IP
packet are processed. As such, duplicate QUIC packets are not processed
and do not increase ECN counts; see [Section
21.10](#security-ecn){.xref} for relevant security
concerns.[¶](#section-13.4.1-6){.pilcrow}

It is possible for faulty network devices to corrupt or erroneously drop
packets that carry a non-zero ECN codepoint. To ensure connectivity in
the presence of such devices, an endpoint validates the ECN counts for
each network path and disables the use of ECN on that path if errors are
detected.[¶](#section-13.4.2-1){.pilcrow}

To perform ECN validation for a new
path:[¶](#section-13.4.2-2){.pilcrow}

-   [The endpoint sets an ECT(0) codepoint in the IP header of early
    outgoing packets sent on a new path to the peer
    \[[RFC8311](#RFC8311){.xref}\].[¶](#section-13.4.2-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-13.4.2-3.1}
-   [The endpoint monitors whether all packets sent with an ECT
    codepoint are eventually deemed lost ([Section
    6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9002#section-6){.relref} of

    validation has
    failed.[¶](#section-13.4.2-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-13.4.2-3.2}

If an endpoint has cause to expect that IP packets with an ECT codepoint
might be dropped by a faulty network element, the endpoint could set an
ECT codepoint for only the first ten outgoing packets on a path, or for
a period of three PTOs (see [Section
6.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9002#section-6.2){.relref} of
\[[QUIC-RECOVERY](#QUIC-RECOVERY){.xref}\]). If all packets marked with
non-zero ECN codepoints are subsequently lost, it can disable marking on
the assumption that the marking caused the
loss.[¶](#section-13.4.2-4){.pilcrow}

An endpoint thus attempts to use ECN and validates this for each new
connection, when switching to a server\'s preferred address, and on
active connection migration to a new path. [Appendix
A.4](#ecn-alg){.xref} describes one possible
algorithm.[¶](#section-13.4.2-5){.pilcrow}

Other methods of probing paths for ECN support are possible, as are
different marking strategies. Implementations [MAY]{.bcp14} use other
methods defined in RFCs; see \[[RFC8311](#RFC8311){.xref}\].
Implementations that use the ECT(1) codepoint need to perform ECN
validation using the reported ECT(1)
counts.[¶](#section-13.4.2-6){.pilcrow}

Erroneous application of ECN-CE markings by the network can result in
degraded connection performance. An endpoint that receives an ACK frame
with ECN counts therefore validates the counts before using them. It
performs this validation by comparing newly received counts against
those from the last successfully processed ACK frame. Any increase in
the ECN counts is validated based on the ECN markings that were applied
to packets that are newly acknowledged in the ACK
frame.[¶](#section-13.4.2.1-1){.pilcrow}

If an ACK frame newly acknowledges a packet that the endpoint sent with
either the ECT(0) or ECT(1) codepoint set, ECN validation fails if the
corresponding ECN counts are not present in the ACK frame. This check
detects a network element that zeroes the ECN field or a peer that does
not report ECN markings.[¶](#section-13.4.2.1-2){.pilcrow}

ECN validation also fails if the sum of the increase in ECT(0) and
ECN-CE counts is less than the number of newly acknowledged packets that
were originally sent with an ECT(0) marking. Similarly, ECN validation
fails if the sum of the increases to ECT(1) and ECN-CE counts is less
than the number of newly acknowledged packets sent with an ECT(1)
marking. These checks can detect remarking of ECN-CE markings by the
network.[¶](#section-13.4.2.1-3){.pilcrow}

An endpoint could miss acknowledgments for a packet when ACK frames are
lost. It is therefore possible for the total increase in ECT(0), ECT(1),
and ECN-CE counts to be greater than the number of packets that are
newly acknowledged by an ACK frame. This is why ECN counts are permitted
to be larger than the total number of packets that are
acknowledged.[¶](#section-13.4.2.1-4){.pilcrow}

Validating ECN counts from reordered ACK frames can result in failure.
An endpoint [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} fail ECN validation as a result of
processing an ACK frame that does not increase the largest acknowledged
packet number.[¶](#section-13.4.2.1-5){.pilcrow}

ECN validation can fail if the received total count for either ECT(0) or
ECT(1) exceeds the total number of packets sent with each corresponding
ECT codepoint. In particular, validation will fail when an endpoint
receives a non-zero ECN count corresponding to an ECT codepoint that it
never applied. This check detects when packets are remarked to ECT(0) or
ECT(1) in the network.[¶](#section-13.4.2.1-6){.pilcrow}

If validation fails, then the endpoint [MUST]{.bcp14} disable ECN. It

## [14.](#section-14){.section-number .selfRef} [Datagram Size](#name-datagram-size){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-datagram-size}

A UDP datagram can include one or more QUIC packets. The datagram size
refers to the total UDP payload size of a single UDP datagram carrying
QUIC packets. The datagram size includes one or more QUIC packet headers
and protected payloads, but not the UDP or IP
headers.[¶](#section-14-1){.pilcrow}

The maximum datagram size is defined as the largest size of UDP payload
that can be sent across a network path using a single UDP datagram. QUIC
[MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be used if the network path cannot support a maximum
datagram size of at least 1200 bytes.[¶](#section-14-2){.pilcrow}

QUIC assumes a minimum IP packet size of at least 1280 bytes. This is
the IPv6 minimum size \[[IPv6](#IPv6){.xref}\] and is also supported by
most modern IPv4 networks. Assuming the minimum IP header size of 40
bytes for IPv6 and 20 bytes for IPv4 and a UDP header size of 8 bytes,
this results in a maximum datagram size of 1232 bytes for IPv6 and 1252
bytes for IPv4. Thus, modern IPv4 and all IPv6 network paths are
expected to be able to support QUIC.[¶](#section-14-3){.pilcrow}

Note: This requirement to support a UDP payload of 1200 bytes limits the
space available for IPv6 extension headers to 32 bytes or IPv4 options
to 52 bytes if the path only supports the IPv6 minimum MTU of 1280
bytes. This affects Initial packets and path
validation.[¶](#section-14-4.1){.pilcrow}

Any maximum datagram size larger than 1200 bytes can be discovered using
Path Maximum Transmission Unit Discovery (PMTUD) (see [Section
14.2.1](#pmtud){.xref}) or Datagram Packetization Layer PMTU Discovery
(DPLPMTUD) (see [Section
14.3](#dplpmtud){.xref}).[¶](#section-14-5){.pilcrow}

Enforcement of the max_udp_payload_size transport parameter ([Section
18.2](#transport-parameter-definitions){.xref}) might act as an
additional limit on the maximum datagram size. A sender can avoid
exceeding this limit, once the value is known. However, prior to
learning the value of the transport parameter, endpoints risk datagrams
being lost if they send datagrams larger than the smallest allowed
maximum datagram size of 1200 bytes.[¶](#section-14-6){.pilcrow}

UDP datagrams [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be fragmented at the IP layer. In IPv4
\[[IPv4](#IPv4){.xref}\], the Don\'t Fragment (DF) bit [MUST]{.bcp14} be
set if possible, to prevent fragmentation on the
path.[¶](#section-14-7){.pilcrow}

QUIC sometimes requires datagrams to be no smaller than a certain size;
see [Section 8.1](#validate-handshake){.xref} as an example. However,
the size of a datagram is not authenticated. That is, if an endpoint
receives a datagram of a certain size, it cannot know that the sender
sent the datagram at the same size. Therefore, an endpoint [MUST
NOT]{.bcp14} close a connection when it receives a datagram that does
not meet size constraints; the endpoint [MAY]{.bcp14} discard such
datagrams.[¶](#section-14-8){.pilcrow}

### [14.1.](#section-14.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Initial Datagram Size](#name-initial-datagram-size){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-initial-datagram-size}

A client [MUST]{.bcp14} expand the payload of all UDP datagrams carrying
Initial packets to at least the smallest allowed maximum datagram size
of 1200 bytes by adding PADDING frames to the Initial packet or by
coalescing the Initial packet; see [Section
12.2](#packet-coalesce){.xref}. Initial packets can even be coalesced
with invalid packets, which a receiver will discard. Similarly, a server
[MUST]{.bcp14} expand the payload of all UDP datagrams carrying
ack-eliciting Initial packets to at least the smallest allowed maximum
datagram size of 1200 bytes.[¶](#section-14.1-1){.pilcrow}

Sending UDP datagrams of this size ensures that the network path
supports a reasonable Path Maximum Transmission Unit (PMTU), in both
directions. Additionally, a client that expands Initial packets helps
reduce the amplitude of amplification attacks caused by server responses
toward an unverified client address; see [Section
8](#address-validation){.xref}.[¶](#section-14.1-2){.pilcrow}

Datagrams containing Initial packets [MAY]{.bcp14} exceed 1200 bytes if
the sender believes that the network path and peer both support the size
that it chooses.[¶](#section-14.1-3){.pilcrow}

A server [MUST]{.bcp14} discard an Initial packet that is carried in a
UDP datagram with a payload that is smaller than the smallest allowed
maximum datagram size of 1200 bytes. A server [MAY]{.bcp14} also
immediately close the connection by sending a CONNECTION_CLOSE frame
with an error code of PROTOCOL_VIOLATION; see [Section
10.2.3](#immediate-close-hs){.xref}.[¶](#section-14.1-4){.pilcrow}

The server [MUST]{.bcp14} also limit the number of bytes it sends before

The PMTU is the maximum size of the entire IP packet, including the IP
header, UDP header, and UDP payload. The UDP payload includes one or
more QUIC packet headers and protected payloads. The PMTU can depend on
path characteristics and can therefore change over time. The largest UDP
payload an endpoint sends at any given time is referred to as the
endpoint\'s maximum datagram size.[¶](#section-14.2-1){.pilcrow}

An endpoint [SHOULD]{.bcp14} use DPLPMTUD ([Section
14.3](#dplpmtud){.xref}) or PMTUD ([Section 14.2.1](#pmtud){.xref}) to
determine whether the path to a destination will support a desired
maximum datagram size without fragmentation. In the absence of these
mechanisms, QUIC endpoints [SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} send datagrams larger
than the smallest allowed maximum datagram
size.[¶](#section-14.2-2){.pilcrow}

Both DPLPMTUD and PMTUD send datagrams that are larger than the current
maximum datagram size, referred to as PMTU probes. All QUIC packets that
are not sent in a PMTU probe [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be sized to fit within the
maximum datagram size to avoid the datagram being fragmented or dropped
\[[RFC8085](#RFC8085){.xref}\].[¶](#section-14.2-3){.pilcrow}

If a QUIC endpoint determines that the PMTU between any pair of local
and remote IP addresses cannot support the smallest allowed maximum
datagram size of 1200 bytes, it [MUST]{.bcp14} immediately cease sending
QUIC packets, except for those in PMTU probes or those containing
CONNECTION_CLOSE frames, on the affected path. An endpoint [MAY]{.bcp14}
terminate the connection if an alternative path cannot be
found.[¶](#section-14.2-4){.pilcrow}

Each pair of local and remote addresses could have a different PMTU.
QUIC implementations that implement any kind of PMTU discovery therefore

larger than the local router MTU. DPLPMTUD can also optionally use these
messages. This use of ICMP messages is potentially vulnerable to attacks
by entities that cannot observe packets but might successfully guess the
addresses used on the path. These attacks could reduce the PMTU to a
bandwidth-inefficient value.[¶](#section-14.2.1-1){.pilcrow}

Endpoints that rely on the Destination Connection ID field for routing
incoming QUIC packets are likely to require that the connection ID be
included in PMTU probes to route any resulting ICMP messages ([Section
14.2.1](#pmtud){.xref}) back to the correct endpoint. However, only long
header packets ([Section 17.2](#long-header){.xref}) contain the Source
Connection ID field, and long header packets are not decrypted or
acknowledged by the peer once the handshake is
complete.[¶](#section-14.4.1-1){.pilcrow}

One way to construct a PMTU probe is to coalesce (see [Section
12.2](#packet-coalesce){.xref}) a packet with a long header, such as a
Handshake or 0-RTT packet ([Section 17.2](#long-header){.xref}), with a
short header packet in a single UDP datagram. If the resulting PMTU
probe reaches the endpoint, the packet with the long header will be
ignored, but the short header packet will be acknowledged. If the PMTU
probe causes an ICMP message to be sent, the first part of the probe
will be quoted in that message. If the Source Connection ID field is
within the quoted portion of the probe, that could be used for routing
or validation of the ICMP message.[¶](#section-14.4.1-2){.pilcrow}

Note: The purpose of using a packet with a long header is only to ensure
that the quoted packet contained in the ICMP message contains a Source
Connection ID field. This packet does not need to be a valid packet, and
it can be sent even if there is no current use for packets of that
type.[¶](#section-14.4.1-3.1){.pilcrow}

## [16.](#section-16){.section-number .selfRef} [Variable-Length Integer Encoding](#name-variable-length-integer-enc){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-variable-length-integer-enc}

QUIC packets and frames commonly use a variable-length encoding for
non-negative integer values. This encoding ensures that smaller integer
values need fewer bytes to encode.[¶](#section-16-1){.pilcrow}

The QUIC variable-length integer encoding reserves the two most
significant bits of the first byte to encode the base-2 logarithm of the
integer encoding length in bytes. The integer value is encoded on the
remaining bits, in network byte order.[¶](#section-16-2){.pilcrow}

This means that integers are encoded on 1, 2, 4, or 8 bytes and can
encode 6-, 14-, 30-, or 62-bit values, respectively. [Table

Packet numbers are integers in the range 0 to 2^62^-1 ([Section
12.3](#packet-numbers){.xref}). When present in long or short packet
headers, they are encoded in 1 to 4 bytes. The number of bits required
to represent the packet number is reduced by including only the least
significant bits of the packet number.[¶](#section-17.1-1){.pilcrow}

The encoded packet number is protected as described in [Section
5.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9001#section-5.4){.relref} of
\[[QUIC-TLS](#QUIC-TLS){.xref}\].[¶](#section-17.1-2){.pilcrow}

Prior to receiving an acknowledgment for a packet number space, the full
packet number [MUST]{.bcp14} be included; it is not to be truncated, as
described below.[¶](#section-17.1-3){.pilcrow}

After an acknowledgment is received for a packet number space, the
sender [MUST]{.bcp14} use a packet number size able to represent more
than twice as large a range as the difference between the largest
acknowledged packet number and the packet number being sent. A peer
receiving the packet will then correctly decode the packet number,
unless the packet is delayed in transit such that it arrives after many
higher-numbered packets have been received. An endpoint [SHOULD]{.bcp14}
use a large enough packet number encoding to allow the packet number to
be recovered even if the packet arrives after packets that are sent
afterwards.[¶](#section-17.1-4){.pilcrow}

As a result, the size of the packet number encoding is at least one bit
more than the base-2 logarithm of the number of contiguous
unacknowledged packet numbers, including the new packet. Pseudocode and
an example for packet number encoding can be found in [Appendix
A.2](#sample-packet-number-encoding){.xref}.[¶](#section-17.1-5){.pilcrow}

At a receiver, protection of the packet number is removed prior to
recovering the full packet number. The full packet number is then
reconstructed based on the number of significant bits present, the value
of those bits, and the largest packet number received in a successfully
authenticated packet. Recovering the full packet number is necessary to
successfully complete the removal of packet
protection.[¶](#section-17.1-6){.pilcrow}

Once header protection is removed, the packet number is decoded by
finding the packet number value that is closest to the next expected
packet. The next expected packet is the highest received packet number
plus one. Pseudocode and an example for packet number decoding can be
found in [Appendix
A.3](#sample-packet-number-decoding){.xref}.[¶](#section-17.1-7){.pilcrow}

Long headers are used for packets that are sent prior to the
establishment of 1-RTT keys. Once 1-RTT keys are available, a sender
switches to sending packets using the short header ([Section
17.3](#short-header){.xref}). The long form allows for special packets
\-- such as the Version Negotiation packet \-- to be represented in this
uniform fixed-length packet format. Packets that use the long header
contain the following fields:[¶](#section-17.2-2){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

Header Form:

:   The most significant bit (0x80) of byte 0 (the first byte) is set to
    1 for long headers.[¶](#section-17.2-3.2.1){.pilcrow}

:   

Fixed Bit:

:   The next bit (0x40) of byte 0 is set to 1, unless the packet is a
    Version Negotiation packet. Packets containing a zero value for this
    bit are not valid packets in this version and [MUST]{.bcp14} be
    discarded. A value of 1 for this bit allows QUIC to coexist with
    other protocols; see
    \[[RFC7983](#RFC7983){.xref}\].[¶](#section-17.2-3.4.1){.pilcrow}

Destination Connection ID Length:

:   The byte following the version contains the length in bytes of the
    Destination Connection ID field that follows it. This length is
    encoded as an 8-bit unsigned integer. In QUIC version 1, this value
    [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} exceed 20 bytes. Endpoints that receive a version
    1 long header with a value larger than 20 [MUST]{.bcp14} drop the
    packet. In order to properly form a Version Negotiation packet,
    servers [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be able to read longer connection IDs from
    other QUIC versions.[¶](#section-17.2-3.12.1){.pilcrow}

packets from different versions of QUIC are
interpreted.[¶](#section-17.2-6){.pilcrow}

The interpretation of the fields and the payload are specific to a
version and packet type. While type-specific semantics for this version
are described in the following sections, several long header packets in
this version of QUIC contain these additional
fields:[¶](#section-17.2-7){.pilcrow}

Reserved Bits:

:   Two bits (those with a mask of 0x0c) of byte 0 are reserved across

    after removing both packet and header protection as a connection
    error of type PROTOCOL_VIOLATION. Discarding such a packet after

    significant two bits (those with a mask of 0x03) of byte 0 contain
    the length of the Packet Number field, encoded as an unsigned
    two-bit integer that is one less than the length of the Packet

QUIC might be multiplexed with other protocols (see
\[[RFC7983](#RFC7983){.xref}\]), servers [SHOULD]{.bcp14} set the most
significant bit of this field (0x40) to 1 so that Version Negotiation
packets appear to have the Fixed Bit field. Note that other versions of
QUIC might not make a similar
recommendation.[¶](#section-17.2.1-5){.pilcrow}

The Version field of a Version Negotiation packet [MUST]{.bcp14} be set

The server [MUST]{.bcp14} include the value from the Source Connection
ID field of the packet it receives in the Destination Connection ID
field. The value for Source Connection ID [MUST]{.bcp14} be copied from
the Destination Connection ID of the received packet, which is initially
randomly selected by a client. Echoing both connection IDs gives clients
some assurance that the server received the packet and that the Version
Negotiation packet was not generated by an entity that did not observe
the Initial packet.[¶](#section-17.2.1-7){.pilcrow}

Future versions of QUIC could have different requirements for the
lengths of connection IDs. In particular, connection IDs might have a
smaller minimum length or a greater maximum length. Version-specific
rules for the connection ID therefore [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} influence a
decision about whether to send a Version Negotiation

The Version Negotiation packet does not include the Packet Number and
Length fields present in other packets that use the long header form.
Consequently, a Version Negotiation packet consumes an entire UDP

:   

In order to prevent tampering by version-unaware middleboxes, Initial
packets are protected with connection- and version-specific keys
(Initial keys) as described in \[[QUIC-TLS](#QUIC-TLS){.xref}\]. This
protection does not provide confidentiality or integrity against
attackers that can observe packets, but it does prevent attackers that
cannot observe packets from spoofing Initial
packets.[¶](#section-17.2.2-5){.pilcrow}

The client and server use the Initial packet type for any packet that
contains an initial cryptographic handshake message. This includes all
cases where a new packet containing the initial cryptographic message
needs to be created, such as the packets sent after receiving a Retry
packet; see [Section
17.2.5](#packet-retry){.xref}.[¶](#section-17.2.2-6){.pilcrow}

A server sends its first Initial packet in response to a client Initial.
A server [MAY]{.bcp14} send multiple Initial packets. The cryptographic
key exchange could require multiple round trips or retransmissions of
this data.[¶](#section-17.2.2-7){.pilcrow}

The payload of an Initial packet includes a CRYPTO frame (or frames)
containing a cryptographic handshake message, ACK frames, or both. PING,
PADDING, and CONNECTION_CLOSE frames of type 0x1c are also permitted. An
endpoint that receives an Initial packet containing other frames can
either discard the packet as spurious or treat it as a connection
error.[¶](#section-17.2.2-8){.pilcrow}

The first packet sent by a client always includes a CRYPTO frame that
contains the start or all of the first cryptographic handshake message.
The first CRYPTO frame sent always begins at an offset of 0; see
[Section 7](#handshake){.xref}.[¶](#section-17.2.2-9){.pilcrow}

Note that if the server sends a TLS HelloRetryRequest (see [Section
4.7](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9001#section-4.7){.relref} of
\[[QUIC-TLS](#QUIC-TLS){.xref}\]), the client will send another series

Subsequent Initial packets from the client include the connection ID and

Other than updating the Destination Connection ID and Token fields, the
Initial packet sent by the client is subject to the same restrictions as
the first Initial packet. A client [MUST]{.bcp14} use the same
cryptographic handshake message it included in this packet. A server
[MAY]{.bcp14} treat a packet that contains a different cryptographic
handshake message as a connection error or discard it. Note that
including a Token field reduces the available space for the
cryptographic handshake message, which might result in the client

A client [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} reset the packet number for any packet
number space after processing a Retry packet. In particular, 0-RTT
packets contain confidential information that will most likely be
retransmitted on receiving a Retry packet. The keys used to protect
these new 0-RTT packets will not change as a result of responding to a
Retry packet. However, the data sent in these packets could be different
than what was sent earlier. Sending these new packets with the same
packet number is likely to compromise the packet protection for those
packets because the same key and nonce could be used to protect
different content. A server [MAY]{.bcp14} abort the connection if it
detects that the client reset the packet
number.[¶](#section-17.2.5.3-4){.pilcrow}

### [17.4.](#section-17.4){.section-number .selfRef} [Latency Spin Bit](#name-latency-spin-bit){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-latency-spin-bit}

The latency spin bit, which is defined for 1-RTT packets ([Section
17.3.1](#packet-1rtt){.xref}), enables passive latency monitoring from
observation points on the network path throughout the duration of a
connection. The server reflects the spin value received, while the
client \"spins\" it after one RTT. On-path observers can measure the
time between two spin bit toggle events to estimate the end-to-end RTT
of a connection.[¶](#section-17.4-1){.pilcrow}

The spin bit is only present in 1-RTT packets, since it is possible to
measure the initial RTT of a connection by observing the handshake.
Therefore, the spin bit is available after version negotiation and
connection establishment are completed. On-path measurement and use of
the latency spin bit are further discussed in
\[[QUIC-MANAGEABILITY](#QUIC-MANAGEABILITY){.xref}\].[¶](#section-17.4-2){.pilcrow}

The spin bit is an [OPTIONAL]{.bcp14} feature of this version of QUIC.
An endpoint that does not support this feature [MUST]{.bcp14} disable
it, as defined below.[¶](#section-17.4-3){.pilcrow}

Each endpoint unilaterally decides if the spin bit is enabled or
disabled for a connection. Implementations [MUST]{.bcp14} allow
administrators of clients and servers to disable the spin bit either
globally or on a per-connection basis. Even when the spin bit is not
disabled by the administrator, endpoints [MUST]{.bcp14} disable their
use of the spin bit for a random selection of at least one in every 16
network paths, or for one in every 16 connection IDs, in order to ensure
that QUIC connections that disable the spin bit are commonly observed on
the network. As each endpoint disables the spin bit independently, this
ensures that the spin bit signal is disabled on approximately one in
eight network paths.[¶](#section-17.4-4){.pilcrow}

When the spin bit is disabled, endpoints [MAY]{.bcp14} set the spin bit
to any value and [MUST]{.bcp14} ignore any incoming value. It is
[RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14} that endpoints set the spin bit to a random value
either chosen independently for each packet or chosen independently for
each connection ID.[¶](#section-17.4-5){.pilcrow}

If the spin bit is enabled for the connection, the endpoint maintains a
spin value for each network path and sets the spin bit in the packet
header to the currently stored value when a 1-RTT packet is sent on that
path. The spin value is initialized to 0 in the endpoint for each
network path. Each endpoint also remembers the highest packet number
seen from its peer on each path.[¶](#section-17.4-6){.pilcrow}

When a server receives a 1-RTT packet that increases the highest packet
number seen by the server from the client on a given network path, it
sets the spin value for that path to be equal to the spin bit in the
received packet.[¶](#section-17.4-7){.pilcrow}

When a client receives a 1-RTT packet that increases the highest packet
number seen by the client from the server on a given network path, it
sets the spin value for that path to the inverse of the spin bit in the
received packet.[¶](#section-17.4-8){.pilcrow}

An endpoint resets the spin value for a network path to 0 when changing
the connection ID being used on that network
path.[¶](#section-17.4-9){.pilcrow}

### [18.2.](#section-18.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Transport Parameter Definitions](#name-transport-parameter-definit){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-transport-parameter-definit}

This section details the transport parameters defined in this
document.[¶](#section-18.2-1){.pilcrow}

Many transport parameters listed here have integer values. Those
transport parameters that are identified as integers use a
variable-length integer encoding; see [Section
16](#integer-encoding){.xref}. Transport parameters have a default value
of 0 if the transport parameter is absent, unless otherwise
stated.[¶](#section-18.2-2){.pilcrow}

The following transport parameters are
defined:[¶](#section-18.2-3){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

original_destination_connection_id (0x00):

:   This parameter is the value of the Destination Connection ID field
    from the first Initial packet sent by the client; see [Section
    7.3](#cid-auth){.xref}. This transport parameter is only sent by a
    server.[¶](#section-18.2-4.2.1){.pilcrow}

:   

max_idle_timeout (0x01):

:   The maximum idle timeout is a value in milliseconds that is encoded
    as an integer; see ([Section 10.1](#idle-timeout){.xref}). Idle
    timeout is disabled when both endpoints omit this transport
    parameter or specify a value of 0.[¶](#section-18.2-4.4.1){.pilcrow}

:   

stateless_reset_token (0x02):

:   A stateless reset token is used in verifying a stateless reset; see
    [Section 10.3](#stateless-reset){.xref}. This parameter is a
    sequence of 16 bytes. This transport parameter [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be
    sent by a client but [MAY]{.bcp14} be sent by a server. A server
    that does not send this transport parameter cannot use stateless
    reset ([Section 10.3](#stateless-reset){.xref}) for the connection
    ID negotiated during the
    handshake.[¶](#section-18.2-4.6.1){.pilcrow}

:   

max_udp_payload_size (0x03):

:   The maximum UDP payload size parameter is an integer value that
    limits the size of UDP payloads that the endpoint is willing to
    receive. UDP datagrams with payloads larger than this limit are not
    likely to be processed by the
    receiver.[¶](#section-18.2-4.8.1){.pilcrow}

:   

:   The default for this parameter is the maximum permitted UDP payload
    of 65527. Values below 1200 are
    invalid.[¶](#section-18.2-4.10.1){.pilcrow}

:   

:   This limit does act as an additional constraint on datagram size in
    the same way as the path MTU, but it is a property of the endpoint
    and not the path; see [Section 14](#datagram-size){.xref}. It is
    expected that this is the space an endpoint dedicates to holding
    incoming packets.[¶](#section-18.2-4.12.1){.pilcrow}

:   

initial_max_data (0x04):

:   The initial maximum data parameter is an integer value that contains
    the initial value for the maximum amount of data that can be sent on
    the connection. This is equivalent to sending a MAX_DATA ([Section
    19.9](#frame-max-data){.xref}) for the connection immediately after
    completing the handshake.[¶](#section-18.2-4.14.1){.pilcrow}

:   

initial_max_stream_data_bidi_local (0x05):

:   This parameter is an integer value specifying the initial flow
    control limit for locally initiated bidirectional streams. This
    limit applies to newly created bidirectional streams opened by the
    endpoint that sends the transport parameter. In client transport
    parameters, this applies to streams with an identifier with the
    least significant two bits set to 0x00; in server transport
    parameters, this applies to streams with the least significant two
    bits set to 0x01.[¶](#section-18.2-4.16.1){.pilcrow}

:   

initial_max_stream_data_bidi_remote (0x06):

:   This parameter is an integer value specifying the initial flow
    control limit for peer-initiated bidirectional streams. This limit
    applies to newly created bidirectional streams opened by the
    endpoint that receives the transport parameter. In client transport
    parameters, this applies to streams with an identifier with the
    least significant two bits set to 0x01; in server transport
    parameters, this applies to streams with the least significant two
    bits set to 0x00.[¶](#section-18.2-4.18.1){.pilcrow}

:   

initial_max_stream_data_uni (0x07):

:   This parameter is an integer value specifying the initial flow
    control limit for unidirectional streams. This limit applies to
    newly created unidirectional streams opened by the endpoint that
    receives the transport parameter. In client transport parameters,
    this applies to streams with an identifier with the least
    significant two bits set to 0x03; in server transport parameters,
    this applies to streams with the least significant two bits set to
    0x02.[¶](#section-18.2-4.20.1){.pilcrow}

:   

initial_max_streams_bidi (0x08):

:   The initial maximum bidirectional streams parameter is an integer
    value that contains the initial maximum number of bidirectional
    streams the endpoint that receives this transport parameter is
    permitted to initiate. If this parameter is absent or zero, the peer
    cannot open bidirectional streams until a MAX_STREAMS frame is sent.
    Setting this parameter is equivalent to sending a MAX_STREAMS
    ([Section 19.11](#frame-max-streams){.xref}) of the corresponding
    type with the same value.[¶](#section-18.2-4.22.1){.pilcrow}

:   

initial_max_streams_uni (0x09):

:   The initial maximum unidirectional streams parameter is an integer
    value that contains the initial maximum number of unidirectional
    streams the endpoint that receives this transport parameter is
    permitted to initiate. If this parameter is absent or zero, the peer
    cannot open unidirectional streams until a MAX_STREAMS frame is
    sent. Setting this parameter is equivalent to sending a MAX_STREAMS
    ([Section 19.11](#frame-max-streams){.xref}) of the corresponding
    type with the same value.[¶](#section-18.2-4.24.1){.pilcrow}

:   

ack_delay_exponent (0x0a):

:   The acknowledgment delay exponent is an integer value indicating an
    exponent used to decode the ACK Delay field in the ACK frame
    ([Section 19.3](#frame-ack){.xref}). If this value is absent, a
    default value of 3 is assumed (indicating a multiplier of 8). Values
    above 20 are invalid.[¶](#section-18.2-4.26.1){.pilcrow}

:   

max_ack_delay (0x0b):

:   The maximum acknowledgment delay is an integer value indicating the
    maximum amount of time in milliseconds by which the endpoint will
    delay sending acknowledgments. This value [SHOULD]{.bcp14} include
    the receiver\'s expected delays in alarms firing. For example, if a
    receiver sets a timer for 5ms and alarms commonly fire up to 1ms
    late, then it should send a max_ack_delay of 6ms. If this value is
    absent, a default of 25 milliseconds is assumed. Values of 2^14^ or
    greater are invalid.[¶](#section-18.2-4.28.1){.pilcrow}

:   

disable_active_migration (0x0c):

:   The disable active migration transport parameter is included if the
    endpoint does not support active connection migration ([Section
    9](#migration){.xref}) on the address being used during the
    handshake. An endpoint that receives this transport parameter [MUST
    NOT]{.bcp14} use a new local address when sending to the address
    that the peer used during the handshake. This transport parameter
    does not prohibit connection migration after a client has acted on a
    preferred_address transport parameter. This parameter is a
    zero-length value.[¶](#section-18.2-4.30.1){.pilcrow}

:   

preferred_address (0x0d):

:   The server\'s preferred address is used to effect a change in server
    address at the end of the handshake, as described in [Section
    9.6](#preferred-address){.xref}. This transport parameter is only
    sent by a server. Servers [MAY]{.bcp14} choose to only send a
    preferred address of one address family by sending an all-zero
    address and port (0.0.0.0:0 or \[::\]:0) for the other family. IP
    addresses are encoded in network byte
    order.[¶](#section-18.2-4.32.1){.pilcrow}

:   

:   The preferred_address transport parameter contains an address and
    port for both IPv4 and IPv6. The four-byte IPv4 Address field is
    followed by the associated two-byte IPv4 Port field. This is
    followed by a 16-byte IPv6 Address field and two-byte IPv6 Port
    field. After address and port pairs, a Connection ID Length field
    describes the length of the following Connection ID field. Finally,
    a 16-byte Stateless Reset Token field includes the stateless reset
    token associated with the connection ID. The format of this
    transport parameter is shown in [Figure
    22](#fig-preferred-address){.xref}
    below.[¶](#section-18.2-4.34.1){.pilcrow}

:   

:   The Connection ID field and the Stateless Reset Token field contain
    an alternative connection ID that has a sequence number of 1; see
    [Section 5.1.1](#issue-cid){.xref}. Having these values sent
    alongside the preferred address ensures that there will be at least
    one unused active connection ID when the client initiates migration
    to the preferred address.[¶](#section-18.2-4.36.1){.pilcrow}

:   

:   The Connection ID and Stateless Reset Token fields of a preferred
    address are identical in syntax and semantics to the corresponding
    fields of a NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame ([Section
    19.15](#frame-new-connection-id){.xref}). A server that chooses a
    zero-length connection ID [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} provide a preferred
    address. Similarly, a server [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} include a
    zero-length connection ID in this transport parameter. A client
    [MUST]{.bcp14} treat a violation of these requirements as a
    connection error of type
    TRANSPORT_PARAMETER_ERROR.[¶](#section-18.2-4.38.1){.pilcrow}

active_connection_id_limit (0x0e):

:   This is an integer value specifying the maximum number of connection
    IDs from the peer that an endpoint is willing to store. This value
    includes the connection ID received during the handshake, that
    received in the preferred_address transport parameter, and those
    received in NEW_CONNECTION_ID frames. The value of the
    active_connection_id_limit parameter [MUST]{.bcp14} be at least 2.
    An endpoint that receives a value less than 2 [MUST]{.bcp14} close
    the connection with an error of type TRANSPORT_PARAMETER_ERROR. If
    this transport parameter is absent, a default of 2 is assumed. If an
    endpoint issues a zero-length connection ID, it will never send a
    NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame and therefore ignores the
    active_connection_id_limit value received from its
    peer.[¶](#section-18.2-6.2.1){.pilcrow}

:   

initial_source_connection_id (0x0f):

:   This is the value that the endpoint included in the Source
    Connection ID field of the first Initial packet it sends for the
    connection; see [Section
    7.3](#cid-auth){.xref}.[¶](#section-18.2-6.4.1){.pilcrow}

:   

retry_source_connection_id (0x10):

:   This is the value that the server included in the Source Connection
    ID field of a Retry packet; see [Section 7.3](#cid-auth){.xref}.
    This transport parameter is only sent by a
    server.[¶](#section-18.2-6.6.1){.pilcrow}

:   

If present, transport parameters that set initial per-stream flow
control limits (initial_max_stream_data_bidi_local,
initial_max_stream_data_bidi_remote, and initial_max_stream_data_uni)
are equivalent to sending a MAX_STREAM_DATA frame ([Section
19.10](#frame-max-stream-data){.xref}) on every stream of the
corresponding type immediately after opening. If the transport parameter
is absent, streams of that type start with a flow control limit of
0.[¶](#section-18.2-7){.pilcrow}

A client [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} include any server-only transport parameter:
original_destination_connection_id, preferred_address,
retry_source_connection_id, or stateless_reset_token. A server
[MUST]{.bcp14} treat receipt of any of these transport parameters as a

Receivers send ACK frames (types 0x02 and 0x03) to inform senders of
packets they have received and processed. The ACK frame contains one or
more ACK Ranges. ACK Ranges identify acknowledged packets. If the frame
type is 0x03, ACK frames also contain the cumulative count of QUIC
packets with associated ECN marks received on the connection up until
this point. QUIC implementations [MUST]{.bcp14} properly handle both
types, and, if they have enabled ECN for packets they send, they
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} use the information in the ECN section to manage their
congestion state.[¶](#section-19.3-1){.pilcrow}

QUIC acknowledgments are irrevocable. Once acknowledged, a packet
remains acknowledged, even if it does not appear in a future ACK frame.
This is unlike reneging for TCP Selective Acknowledgments (SACKs)
\[[RFC2018](#RFC2018){.xref}\].[¶](#section-19.3-2){.pilcrow}

Packets from different packet number spaces can be identified using the
same numeric value. An acknowledgment for a packet needs to indicate
both a packet number and a packet number space. This is accomplished by
having each ACK frame only acknowledge packet numbers in the same space
as the packet in which the ACK frame is
contained.[¶](#section-19.3-3){.pilcrow}

Version Negotiation and Retry packets cannot be acknowledged because
they do not contain a packet number. Rather than relying on ACK frames,
these packets are implicitly acknowledged by the next Initial packet
sent by the client.[¶](#section-19.3-4){.pilcrow}

Largest Acknowledged:

:   A variable-length integer representing the largest packet number the
    peer is acknowledging; this is usually the largest packet number
    that the peer has received prior to generating the ACK frame. Unlike
    the packet number in the QUIC long or short header, the value in an
    ACK frame is not truncated.[¶](#section-19.3-8.2.1){.pilcrow}

:   

ACK Delay:

:   A variable-length integer encoding the acknowledgment delay in
    microseconds; see [Section 13.2.5](#host-delay){.xref}. It is
    decoded by multiplying the value in the field by 2 to the power of
    the ack_delay_exponent transport parameter sent by the sender of the
    ACK frame; see [Section
    18.2](#transport-parameter-definitions){.xref}. Compared to simply
    expressing the delay as an integer, this encoding allows for a
    larger range of values within the same number of bytes, at the cost
    of lower resolution.[¶](#section-19.3-8.4.1){.pilcrow}

:   

ACK Range Count:

:   A variable-length integer specifying the number of ACK Range fields
    in the frame.[¶](#section-19.3-8.6.1){.pilcrow}

:   

First ACK Range:

:   A variable-length integer indicating the number of contiguous
    packets preceding the Largest Acknowledged that are being
    acknowledged. That is, the smallest packet acknowledged in the range
    is determined by subtracting the First ACK Range value from the
    Largest Acknowledged field.[¶](#section-19.3-8.8.1){.pilcrow}

    unacknowledged packets preceding the packet number one lower than
    the smallest in the preceding ACK
    Range.[¶](#section-19.3.1-5.2.1){.pilcrow}

ACK Range Length:

:   A variable-length integer indicating the number of contiguous
    acknowledged packets preceding the largest packet number, as
    determined by the preceding Gap.[¶](#section-19.3.1-5.4.1){.pilcrow}

:   

Gap and ACK Range Length values use a relative integer encoding for
efficiency. Though each encoded value is positive, the values are
subtracted, so that each ACK Range describes progressively
lower-numbered packets.[¶](#section-19.3.1-6){.pilcrow}

Each ACK Range acknowledges a contiguous range of packets by indicating
the number of acknowledged packets that precede the largest packet
number in that range. A value of 0 indicates that only the largest
packet number is acknowledged. Larger ACK Range values indicate a larger
range, with corresponding lower values for the smallest packet number in
the range. Thus, given a largest packet number for the range, the
smallest value is determined by the following
formula:[¶](#section-19.3.1-7){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-19.3.1-8 .artwork .art-text .alignLeft}
       smallest = largest - ack_range

[¶](#section-19.3.1-8){.pilcrow}
:::

An ACK Range acknowledges all packets between the smallest packet number
and the largest, inclusive.[¶](#section-19.3.1-9){.pilcrow}

The largest value for an ACK Range is determined by cumulatively
subtracting the size of all preceding ACK Range Lengths and
Gaps.[¶](#section-19.3.1-10){.pilcrow}

Each Gap indicates a range of packets that are not being acknowledged.
The number of packets in the gap is one higher than the encoded value of
the Gap field.[¶](#section-19.3.1-11){.pilcrow}

The value of the Gap field establishes the largest packet number value

A CRYPTO frame (type=0x06) is used to transmit cryptographic handshake
messages. It can be sent in all packet types except 0-RTT. The CRYPTO
frame offers the cryptographic protocol an in-order stream of bytes.
CRYPTO frames are functionally identical to STREAM frames, except that
they do not bear a stream identifier; they are not flow controlled; and
they do not carry markers for optional offset, optional length, and the
end of the stream.[¶](#section-19.6-1){.pilcrow}

    bytes of the stream, or the end of a stream that includes no
    data).[¶](#section-19.8-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-19.8-2.1}

### [19.14.](#section-19.14){.section-number .selfRef} [STREAMS_BLOCKED Frames](#name-streams_blocked-frames){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-streams_blocked-frames}

A sender [SHOULD]{.bcp14} send a STREAMS_BLOCKED frame (type=0x16 or
0x17) when it wishes to open a stream but is unable to do so due to the
maximum stream limit set by its peer; see [Section
19.11](#frame-max-streams){.xref}. A STREAMS_BLOCKED frame of type 0x16
is used to indicate reaching the bidirectional stream limit, and a
STREAMS_BLOCKED frame of type 0x17 is used to indicate reaching the
unidirectional stream limit.[¶](#section-19.14-1){.pilcrow}

A STREAMS_BLOCKED frame does not open the stream, but informs the peer
that a new stream was needed and the stream limit prevented the creation
of the stream.[¶](#section-19.14-2){.pilcrow}

Sequence Number:

:   The sequence number assigned to the connection ID by the sender,
    encoded as a variable-length integer; see [Section
    5.1.1](#issue-cid){.xref}.[¶](#section-19.15-5.2.1){.pilcrow}

:   

Length:

:   An 8-bit unsigned integer containing the length of the connection
    ID. Values less than 1 and greater than 20 are invalid and
    [MUST]{.bcp14} be treated as a connection error of type
    FRAME_ENCODING_ERROR.[¶](#section-19.15-5.6.1){.pilcrow}

:   

Connection ID:

:   A connection ID of the specified
    length.[¶](#section-19.15-5.8.1){.pilcrow}

:   

Stateless Reset Token:

:   A 128-bit value that will be used for a stateless reset when the
    associated connection ID is used; see [Section
    10.3](#stateless-reset){.xref}.[¶](#section-19.15-5.10.1){.pilcrow}

:   

An endpoint [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} send this frame if it currently requires
that its peer send packets with a zero-length Destination Connection ID.
Changing the length of a connection ID to or from zero length makes it
difficult to identify when the value of the connection ID changed. An
endpoint that is sending packets with a zero-length Destination
Connection ID [MUST]{.bcp14} treat receipt of a NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame
as a connection error of type
PROTOCOL_VIOLATION.[¶](#section-19.15-6){.pilcrow}

Transmission errors, timeouts, and retransmissions might cause the same
NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame to be received multiple times. Receipt of the
same frame multiple times [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be treated as a connection
error. A receiver can use the sequence number supplied in the
NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame to handle receiving the same NEW_CONNECTION_ID
frame multiple times.[¶](#section-19.15-7){.pilcrow}

If an endpoint receives a NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame that repeats a
previously issued connection ID with a different Stateless Reset Token
field value or a different Sequence Number field value, or if a sequence
number is used for different connection IDs, the endpoint [MAY]{.bcp14}
treat that receipt as a connection error of type
PROTOCOL_VIOLATION.[¶](#section-19.15-8){.pilcrow}

The Retire Prior To field applies to connection IDs established during
connection setup and the preferred_address transport parameter; see
[Section 5.1.2](#retire-cid){.xref}. The value in the Retire Prior To
field [MUST]{.bcp14} be less than or equal to the value in the Sequence
Number field. Receiving a value in the Retire Prior To field that is
greater than that in the Sequence Number field [MUST]{.bcp14} be treated
as a connection error of type
FRAME_ENCODING_ERROR.[¶](#section-19.15-9){.pilcrow}

Once a sender indicates a Retire Prior To value, smaller values sent in
subsequent NEW_CONNECTION_ID frames have no effect. A receiver
[MUST]{.bcp14} ignore any Retire Prior To fields that do not increase
the largest received Retire Prior To
value.[¶](#section-19.15-10){.pilcrow}

An endpoint that receives a NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame with a sequence
number smaller than the Retire Prior To field of a previously received
NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame [MUST]{.bcp14} send a corresponding
RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frame that retires the newly received connection
ID, unless it has already done so for that sequence
number.[¶](#section-19.15-11){.pilcrow}

An endpoint sends a RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frame (type=0x19) to indicate
that it will no longer use a connection ID that was issued by its peer.
This includes the connection ID provided during the handshake. Sending a
RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frame also serves as a request to the peer to send
additional connection IDs for future use; see [Section

peer using the NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame ([Section

Frame Type:

    the error. A value of 0 (equivalent to the mention of the PADDING
    frame) is used when the frame type is unknown. The
    application-specific variant of CONNECTION_CLOSE (type 0x1d) does
    not include this field.[¶](#section-19.19-6.4.1){.pilcrow}

:   

Reason Phrase Length:

:   A variable-length integer specifying the length of the reason phrase
    in bytes. Because a CONNECTION_CLOSE frame cannot be split between
    packets, any limits on packet size will also limit the space
    available for a reason phrase.[¶](#section-19.19-6.6.1){.pilcrow}

:   

Reason Phrase:

:   Additional diagnostic information for the closure. This can be zero
    length if the sender chooses not to give details beyond the Error

QUIC frames do not use a self-describing encoding. An endpoint therefore
needs to understand the syntax of all frames before it can successfully
process a packet. This allows for efficient encoding of frames, but it
means that an endpoint cannot send a frame of a type that is unknown to
its peer.[¶](#section-19.21-1){.pilcrow}

An extension to QUIC that wishes to use a new type of frame
[MUST]{.bcp14} first ensure that a peer is able to understand the frame.
An endpoint can use a transport parameter to signal its willingness to
receive extension frame types. One transport parameter can indicate
support for one or more extension frame
types.[¶](#section-19.21-2){.pilcrow}

Extensions that modify or replace core protocol functionality (including
frame types) will be difficult to combine with other extensions that
modify or replace the same functionality unless the behavior of the
combination is explicitly defined. Such extensions [SHOULD]{.bcp14}
define their interaction with previously defined extensions modifying
the same protocol components.[¶](#section-19.21-3){.pilcrow}

Extension frames [MUST]{.bcp14} be congestion controlled and
[MUST]{.bcp14} cause an ACK frame to be sent. The exception is extension
frames that replace or supplement the ACK frame. Extension frames are
not included in flow control unless specified in the
extension.[¶](#section-19.21-4){.pilcrow}

The goal of QUIC is to provide a secure transport connection. [Section

properties; subsequent sections discuss constraints and caveats
regarding these properties, including descriptions of known attacks and
countermeasures.[¶](#section-21-1){.pilcrow}

### [21.1.](#section-21.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Overview of Security Properties](#name-overview-of-security-proper){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-overview-of-security-proper}

A complete security analysis of QUIC is outside the scope of this
document. This section provides an informal description of the desired
security properties as an aid to implementers and to help guide protocol
analysis.[¶](#section-21.1-1){.pilcrow}

QUIC assumes the threat model described in
\[[SEC-CONS](#SEC-CONS){.xref}\] and provides protections against many
of the attacks that arise from that model.[¶](#section-21.1-2){.pilcrow}

For this purpose, attacks are divided into passive and active attacks.
Passive attackers have the ability to read packets from the network,
while active attackers also have the ability to write packets into the
network. However, a passive attack could involve an attacker with the
ability to cause a routing change or other modification in the path
taken by packets that comprise a
connection.[¶](#section-21.1-3){.pilcrow}

Attackers are additionally categorized as either on-path attackers or
off-path attackers. An on-path attacker can read, modify, or remove any
packet it observes such that the packet no longer reaches its
destination, while an off-path attacker observes the packets but cannot
prevent the original packet from reaching its intended destination. Both
types of attackers can also transmit arbitrary packets. This definition
differs from that of [Section
3.5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3552#section-3.5){.relref} of
\[[SEC-CONS](#SEC-CONS){.xref}\] in that an off-path attacker is able to
observe packets.[¶](#section-21.1-4){.pilcrow}

Properties of the handshake, protected packets, and connection migration
are considered separately.[¶](#section-21.1-5){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-21.1.1 .section}
#### [21.1.1.](#section-21.1.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Handshake](#name-handshake){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-handshake}

The QUIC handshake incorporates the TLS 1.3 handshake and inherits the
cryptographic properties described in [Appendix
E.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8446#appendix-E.1){.relref} of
\[[TLS13](#TLS13){.xref}\]. Many of the security properties of QUIC
depend on the TLS handshake providing these properties. Any attack on
the TLS handshake could affect QUIC.[¶](#section-21.1.1-1){.pilcrow}

Any attack on the TLS handshake that compromises the secrecy or
uniqueness of session keys, or the authentication of the participating
peers, affects other security guarantees provided by QUIC that depend on
those keys. For instance, migration ([Section 9](#migration){.xref})
depends on the efficacy of confidentiality protections, both for the
negotiation of keys using the TLS handshake and for QUIC packet
protection, to avoid linkability across network
paths.[¶](#section-21.1.1-2){.pilcrow}

An attack on the integrity of the TLS handshake might allow an attacker
to affect the selection of application protocol or QUIC
version.[¶](#section-21.1.1-3){.pilcrow}

In addition to the properties provided by TLS, the QUIC handshake
provides some defense against DoS attacks on the
handshake.[¶](#section-21.1.1-4){.pilcrow}

##### [21.1.1.1.](#section-21.1.1.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Anti-Amplification](#name-anti-amplification){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-anti-amplification}

Address validation ([Section 8](#address-validation){.xref}) is used to
verify that an entity that claims a given address is able to receive
packets at that address. Address validation limits amplification attack
targets to addresses for which an attacker can observe
packets.[¶](#section-21.1.1.1-1){.pilcrow}

Prior to address validation, endpoints are limited in what they are able
to send. Endpoints cannot send data toward an unvalidated address in
excess of three times the data received from that
address.[¶](#section-21.1.1.1-2){.pilcrow}

Note: The anti-amplification limit only applies when an endpoint
responds to packets received from an unvalidated address. The
anti-amplification limit does not apply to clients when establishing a
new connection or when initiating connection
migration.[¶](#section-21.1.1.1-3.1){.pilcrow}

Computing the server\'s first flight for a full handshake is potentially
expensive, requiring both a signature and a key exchange computation. In
order to prevent computational DoS attacks, the Retry packet provides a
cheap token exchange mechanism that allows servers to validate a
client\'s IP address prior to doing any expensive computations at the
cost of a single round trip. After a successful handshake, servers can
issue new tokens to a client, which will allow new connection
establishment without incurring this
cost.[¶](#section-21.1.1.2-1){.pilcrow}

An on-path or off-path attacker can force a handshake to fail by
replacing or racing Initial packets. Once valid Initial packets have
been exchanged, subsequent Handshake packets are protected with the
Handshake keys, and an on-path attacker cannot force handshake failure
other than by dropping packets to cause endpoints to abandon the
attempt.[¶](#section-21.1.1.3-1){.pilcrow}

An on-path attacker can also replace the addresses of packets on either
side and therefore cause the client or server to have an incorrect view
of the remote addresses. Such an attack is indistinguishable from the
functions performed by a NAT.[¶](#section-21.1.1.3-2){.pilcrow}

The entire handshake is cryptographically protected, with the Initial
packets being encrypted with per-version keys and the Handshake and
later packets being encrypted with keys derived from the TLS key
exchange. Further, parameter negotiation is folded into the TLS
transcript and thus provides the same integrity guarantees as ordinary
TLS negotiation. An attacker can observe the client\'s transport
parameters (as long as it knows the version-specific salt) but cannot
observe the server\'s transport parameters and cannot influence
parameter negotiation.[¶](#section-21.1.1.4-1){.pilcrow}

Connection IDs are unencrypted but integrity protected in all
packets.[¶](#section-21.1.1.4-2){.pilcrow}

mechanism; implementations of incompatible versions will simply fail to

Packet protection ([Section 12.1](#packet-protected){.xref}) applies
authenticated encryption to all packets except Version Negotiation
packets, though Initial and Retry packets have limited protection due to
the use of version-specific keying material; see
\[[QUIC-TLS](#QUIC-TLS){.xref}\] for more details. This section
considers passive and active attacks against protected
packets.[¶](#section-21.1.2-1){.pilcrow}

Both on-path and off-path attackers can mount a passive attack in which
they save observed packets for an offline attack against packet
protection at a future time; this is true for any observer of any packet
on any network.[¶](#section-21.1.2-2){.pilcrow}

An attacker that injects packets without being able to observe valid
packets for a connection is unlikely to be successful, since packet
protection ensures that valid packets are only generated by endpoints
that possess the key material established during the handshake; see
Sections [7](#handshake){.xref} and
[21.1.1](#handshake-properties){.xref}. Similarly, any active attacker
that observes packets and attempts to insert new data or modify existing
data in those packets should not be able to generate packets deemed
valid by the receiving endpoint, other than Initial
packets.[¶](#section-21.1.2-3){.pilcrow}

A spoofing attack, in which an active attacker rewrites unprotected
parts of a packet that it forwards or injects, such as the source or
destination address, is only effective if the attacker can forward
packets to the original endpoint. Packet protection ensures that the
packet payloads can only be processed by the endpoints that completed
the handshake, and invalid packets are ignored by those
endpoints.[¶](#section-21.1.2-4){.pilcrow}

An attacker can also modify the boundaries between packets and UDP
datagrams, causing multiple packets to be coalesced into a single
datagram or splitting coalesced packets into multiple datagrams. Aside
from datagrams containing Initial packets, which require padding,
modification of how packets are arranged in datagrams has no functional
effect on a connection, although it might change some performance
characteristics.[¶](#section-21.1.2-5){.pilcrow}

Connection migration ([Section 9](#migration){.xref}) provides endpoints
with the ability to transition between IP addresses and ports on
multiple paths, using one path at a time for transmission and receipt of
non-probing frames. Path validation ([Section
8.2](#migrate-validate){.xref}) establishes that a peer is both willing
and able to receive packets sent on a particular path. This helps reduce
the effects of address spoofing by limiting the number of packets sent
to a spoofed address.[¶](#section-21.1.3-1){.pilcrow}

For the purposes of this discussion, it is assumed that an off-path

network that will reach the destination endpoint prior to the arrival of
the original packet observed by the attacker. In other words, an
attacker has the ability to consistently \"win\" a race with the

A limited on-path attacker differs from an on-path attacker in that it
is not on the original path between endpoints, and therefore the
original packets sent by an endpoint are still reaching their

the destination faster than their original path will not prevent the

### [21.2.](#section-21.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Handshake Denial of Service](#name-handshake-denial-of-service){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-handshake-denial-of-service}

As an encrypted and authenticated transport, QUIC provides a range of
protections against denial of service. Once the cryptographic handshake
is complete, QUIC endpoints discard most packets that are not
authenticated, greatly limiting the ability of an attacker to interfere
with existing connections.[¶](#section-21.2-1){.pilcrow}

Once a connection is established, QUIC endpoints might accept some
unauthenticated ICMP packets (see [Section 14.2.1](#pmtud){.xref}), but
the use of these packets is extremely limited. The only other type of
packet that an endpoint might accept is a stateless reset ([Section
10.3](#stateless-reset){.xref}), which relies on the token being kept
secret until it is used.[¶](#section-21.2-2){.pilcrow}

During the creation of a connection, QUIC only provides protection
against attacks from off the network path. All QUIC packets contain
proof that the recipient saw a preceding packet from its
peer.[¶](#section-21.2-3){.pilcrow}

Addresses cannot change during the handshake, so endpoints can discard
packets that are received on a different network
path.[¶](#section-21.2-4){.pilcrow}

The Source and Destination Connection ID fields are the primary means of
protection against an off-path attack during the handshake; see [Section
8.1](#validate-handshake){.xref}. These are required to match those set
by a peer. Except for Initial and Stateless Resets, an endpoint only
accepts packets that include a Destination Connection ID field that
matches a value the endpoint previously chose. This is the only
protection offered for Version Negotiation
packets.[¶](#section-21.2-5){.pilcrow}

The Destination Connection ID field in an Initial packet is selected by
a client to be unpredictable, which serves an additional purpose. The
packets that carry the cryptographic handshake are protected with a key
that is derived from this connection ID and a salt specific to the QUIC
version. This allows endpoints to use the same process for
authenticating packets that they receive as they use after the
cryptographic handshake completes. Packets that cannot be authenticated
are discarded. Protecting packets in this fashion provides a strong
assurance that the sender of the packet saw the Initial packet and
understood it.[¶](#section-21.2-6){.pilcrow}

These protections are not intended to be effective against an attacker
that is able to receive QUIC packets prior to the connection being
established. Such an attacker can potentially send packets that will be
accepted by QUIC endpoints. This version of QUIC attempts to detect this
sort of attack, but it expects that endpoints will fail to establish a
connection rather than recovering. For the most part, the cryptographic
handshake protocol \[[QUIC-TLS](#QUIC-TLS){.xref}\] is responsible for
detecting tampering during the handshake.[¶](#section-21.2-7){.pilcrow}

Endpoints are permitted to use other methods to detect and attempt to
recover from interference with the handshake. Invalid packets can be
identified and discarded using other methods, but no specific method is
mandated in this document.[¶](#section-21.2-8){.pilcrow}

An attacker might be able to receive an address validation token
([Section 8](#address-validation){.xref}) from a server and then release
the IP address it used to acquire that token. At a later time, the

congestion window\'s worth of data towards the

### [21.5.](#section-21.5){.section-number .selfRef} [Request Forgery Attacks](#name-request-forgery-attacks){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-request-forgery-attacks}

A request forgery attack occurs where an endpoint causes its peer to
issue a request towards a victim, with the request controlled by the
endpoint. Request forgery attacks aim to provide an attacker with access
to capabilities of its peer that might otherwise be unavailable to the
attacker. For a networking protocol, a request forgery attack is often
used to exploit any implicit authorization conferred on the peer by the
victim due to the peer\'s location in the
network.[¶](#section-21.5-1){.pilcrow}

For request forgery to be effective, an attacker needs to be able to
influence what packets the peer sends and where these packets are sent.
If an attacker can target a vulnerable service with a controlled
payload, that service might perform actions that are attributed to the
attacker\'s peer but are decided by the
attacker.[¶](#section-21.5-2){.pilcrow}

For example, cross-site request forgery \[[CSRF](#CSRF){.xref}\]
exploits on the Web cause a client to issue requests that include
authorization cookies \[[COOKIE](#COOKIE){.xref}\], allowing one site
access to information and actions that are intended to be restricted to
a different site.[¶](#section-21.5-3){.pilcrow}

As QUIC runs over UDP, the primary attack modality of concern is one
where an attacker can select the address to which its peer sends UDP
datagrams and can control some of the unprotected content of those
packets. As much of the data sent by QUIC endpoints is protected, this
includes control over ciphertext. An attack is successful if an attacker
can cause a peer to send a UDP datagram to a host that will perform some
action based on content in the datagram.[¶](#section-21.5-4){.pilcrow}

This section discusses ways in which QUIC might be used for request
forgery attacks.[¶](#section-21.5-5){.pilcrow}

This section also describes limited countermeasures that can be
implemented by QUIC endpoints. These mitigations can be employed
unilaterally by a QUIC implementation or deployment, without potential
targets for request forgery attacks taking action. However, these
countermeasures could be insufficient if UDP-based services do not
properly authorize requests.[¶](#section-21.5-6){.pilcrow}

Because the migration attack described in [Section
21.5.4](#request-forgery-with-spoofed-migration){.xref} is quite
powerful and does not have adequate countermeasures, QUIC server
implementations should assume that attackers can cause them to generate
arbitrary UDP payloads to arbitrary destinations. QUIC servers [SHOULD
NOT]{.bcp14} be deployed in networks that do not deploy ingress
filtering \[[BCP38](#BCP38){.xref}\] and also have inadequately secured
UDP endpoints.[¶](#section-21.5-7){.pilcrow}

Although it is not generally possible to ensure that clients are not
co-located with vulnerable endpoints, this version of QUIC does not
allow servers to migrate, thus preventing spoofed migration attacks on
clients. Any future extension that allows server migration
[MUST]{.bcp14} also define countermeasures for forgery
attacks.[¶](#section-21.5-8){.pilcrow}

QUIC offers some opportunities for an attacker to influence or control
where its peer sends UDP datagrams:[¶](#section-21.5.1-1){.pilcrow}

-   [initial connection establishment ([Section 7](#handshake){.xref}),
    where a server is able to choose where a client sends datagrams \--
    for example, by populating DNS
    records;[¶](#section-21.5.1-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-21.5.1-2.1}

-   [spoofed connection migrations ([Section
    9.3.1](#address-spoofing){.xref}), where a client is able to use
    source address spoofing to select where a server sends subsequent
    datagrams;
    and[¶](#section-21.5.1-2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-21.5.1-2.3}
-   [spoofed packets that cause a server to send a Version Negotiation
    packet ([Section
    21.5.5](#vn-spoofing){.xref}).[¶](#section-21.5.1-2.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-21.5.1-2.4}

In all cases, the attacker can cause its peer to send datagrams to a
victim that might not understand QUIC. That is, these packets are sent
by the peer prior to address validation; see [Section
8](#address-validation){.xref}.[¶](#section-21.5.1-3){.pilcrow}

Outside of the encrypted portion of packets, QUIC offers an endpoint
several options for controlling the content of UDP datagrams that its
peer sends. The Destination Connection ID field offers direct control
over bytes that appear early in packets sent by the peer; see [Section
5.1](#connection-id){.xref}. The Token field in Initial packets offers a
server control over other bytes of Initial packets; see [Section
17.2.2](#packet-initial){.xref}.[¶](#section-21.5.1-4){.pilcrow}

There are no measures in this version of QUIC to prevent indirect
control over the encrypted portions of packets. It is necessary to
assume that endpoints are able to control the contents of frames that a
peer sends, especially those frames that convey application data, such
as STREAM frames. Though this depends to some degree on details of the
application protocol, some control is possible in many protocol usage
contexts. As the attacker has access to packet protection keys, they are
likely to be capable of predicting how a peer will encrypt future
packets. Successful control over datagram content then only requires
that the attacker be able to predict the packet number and placement of
frames in packets with some amount of
reliability.[¶](#section-21.5.1-5){.pilcrow}

This section assumes that limiting control over datagram content is not
feasible. The focus of the mitigations in subsequent sections is on
limiting the ways in which datagrams that are sent prior to address
validation can be used for request
forgery.[¶](#section-21.5.1-6){.pilcrow}

An attacker acting as a server can choose the IP address and port on
which it advertises its availability, so Initial packets from clients
are assumed to be available for use in this sort of attack. The address
validation implicit in the handshake ensures that \-- for a new
connection \-- a client will not send other types of packets to a
destination that does not understand QUIC or is not willing to accept a
QUIC connection.[¶](#section-21.5.2-1){.pilcrow}

Initial packet protection ([Section
5.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9001#section-5.2){.relref} of
\[[QUIC-TLS](#QUIC-TLS){.xref}\]) makes it difficult for servers to
control the content of Initial packets sent by clients. A client
choosing an unpredictable Destination Connection ID ensures that servers
are unable to control any of the encrypted portion of Initial packets
from clients.[¶](#section-21.5.2-2){.pilcrow}

However, the Token field is open to server control and does allow a
server to use clients to mount request forgery attacks. The use of
tokens provided with the NEW_TOKEN frame ([Section
8.1.3](#validate-future){.xref}) offers the only option for request
forgery during connection establishment.[¶](#section-21.5.2-3){.pilcrow}

Clients, however, are not obligated to use the NEW_TOKEN frame. Request
forgery attacks that rely on the Token field can be avoided if clients
send an empty Token field when the server address has changed from when
the NEW_TOKEN frame was received.[¶](#section-21.5.2-4){.pilcrow}

Clients could avoid using NEW_TOKEN if the server address changes.
However, not including a Token field could adversely affect performance.
Servers could rely on NEW_TOKEN to enable the sending of data in excess
of the three-times limit on sending data; see [Section
8.1](#validate-handshake){.xref}. In particular, this affects cases
where clients use 0-RTT to request data from
servers.[¶](#section-21.5.2-5){.pilcrow}

Sending a Retry packet ([Section 17.2.5](#packet-retry){.xref}) offers a
server the option to change the Token field. After sending a Retry, the
server can also control the Destination Connection ID field of
subsequent Initial packets from the client. This also might allow
indirect control over the encrypted content of Initial packets. However,
the exchange of a Retry packet validates the server\'s address, thereby
preventing the use of subsequent Initial packets for request
forgery.[¶](#section-21.5.2-6){.pilcrow}

Servers can specify a preferred address, which clients then migrate to
after confirming the handshake; see [Section
9.6](#preferred-address){.xref}. The Destination Connection ID field of
packets that the client sends to a preferred address can be used for

Clients are able to present a spoofed source address as part of an

The Destination Connection ID field in any packets that a server
subsequently sends to this spoofed address can be used for request
forgery. A client might also be able to influence the
ciphertext.[¶](#section-21.5.4-2){.pilcrow}

A server that only sends probing packets ([Section
9.1](#probing){.xref}) to an address prior to address validation
provides an attacker with only limited control over the encrypted
portion of datagrams. However, particularly for NAT rebinding, this can
adversely affect performance. If the server sends frames carrying

The absence of size restrictions on the connection ID fields for packets

The most effective defense against request forgery attacks is to modify
vulnerable services to use strong authentication. However, this is not
always something that is within the control of a QUIC deployment. This
section outlines some other steps that QUIC endpoints could take
unilaterally. These additional steps are all discretionary because,
depending on circumstances, they could interfere with or prevent
legitimate uses.[¶](#section-21.5.6-1){.pilcrow}

Services offered over loopback interfaces often lack proper
authentication. Endpoints [MAY]{.bcp14} prevent connection attempts or
migration to a loopback address. Endpoints [SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} allow
connections or migration to a loopback address if the same service was
previously available at a different interface or if the address was
provided by a service at a non-loopback address. Endpoints that depend
on these capabilities could offer an option to disable these
protections.[¶](#section-21.5.6-2){.pilcrow}

Similarly, endpoints could regard a change in address to a link-local
address \[[RFC4291](#RFC4291){.xref}\] or an address in a private-use
range \[[RFC1918](#RFC1918){.xref}\] from a global, unique-local
\[[RFC4193](#RFC4193){.xref}\], or non-private address as a potential
attempt at request forgery. Endpoints could refuse to use these
addresses entirely, but that carries a significant risk of interfering
with legitimate uses. Endpoints [SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} refuse to use an
address unless they have specific knowledge about the network indicating
that sending datagrams to unvalidated addresses in a given range is not
safe.[¶](#section-21.5.6-3){.pilcrow}

Endpoints [MAY]{.bcp14} choose to reduce the risk of request forgery by
not including values from NEW_TOKEN frames in Initial packets or by only
sending probing frames in packets prior to completing address
validation. Note that this does not prevent an attacker from using the
Destination Connection ID field for an
attack.[¶](#section-21.5.6-4){.pilcrow}

Endpoints are not expected to have specific information about the
location of servers that could be vulnerable targets of a request
forgery attack. However, it might be possible over time to identify
specific UDP ports that are common targets of attacks or particular
patterns in datagrams that are used for attacks. Endpoints [MAY]{.bcp14}
choose to avoid sending datagrams to these ports or not send datagrams
that match these patterns prior to validating the destination address.
Endpoints [MAY]{.bcp14} retire connection IDs containing patterns known
to be problematic without using them.[¶](#section-21.5.6-5){.pilcrow}

Note: Modifying endpoints to apply these protections is more efficient
than deploying network-based protections, as endpoints do not need to
perform any additional processing when sending to an address that has
been validated.[¶](#section-21.5.6-6.1){.pilcrow}

The attacks commonly known as Slowloris
\[[SLOWLORIS](#SLOWLORIS){.xref}\] try to keep many connections to the
target endpoint open and hold them open as long as possible. These
attacks can be executed against a QUIC endpoint by generating the
minimum amount of activity necessary to avoid being closed for

opening flow control windows in order to control the sender rate, or
manufacturing ACK frames that simulate a high loss
rate.[¶](#section-21.6-1){.pilcrow}

An adversarial sender might intentionally not send portions of the
stream data, causing the receiver to commit resources for the unsent
data. This could cause a disproportionate receive buffer memory
commitment and/or the creation of a large and inefficient data structure
at the receiver.[¶](#section-21.7-1){.pilcrow}

An adversarial receiver might intentionally not acknowledge packets
containing stream data in an attempt to force the sender to store the
unacknowledged stream data for
retransmission.[¶](#section-21.7-2){.pilcrow}

The attack on receivers is mitigated if flow control windows correspond
to available memory. However, some receivers will overcommit memory and
advertise flow control offsets in the aggregate that exceed actual
available memory. The overcommitment strategy can lead to better
performance when endpoints are well behaved, but renders endpoints
vulnerable to the stream fragmentation
attack.[¶](#section-21.7-3){.pilcrow}

QUIC deployments [SHOULD]{.bcp14} provide mitigations for stream
fragmentation attacks. Mitigations could consist of avoiding
overcommitting memory, limiting the size of tracking data structures,
delaying reassembly of STREAM frames, implementing heuristics based on
the age and duration of reassembly holes, or some combination of
these.[¶](#section-21.7-4){.pilcrow}

An adversarial endpoint can open a large number of streams, exhausting
state on an endpoint. The adversarial endpoint could repeat the process
on a large number of connections, in a manner similar to SYN flooding
attacks in TCP.[¶](#section-21.8-1){.pilcrow}

Normally, clients will open streams sequentially, as explained in
[Section 2.1](#stream-id){.xref}. However, when several streams are
initiated at short intervals, loss or reordering can cause STREAM frames
that open streams to be received out of sequence. On receiving a
higher-numbered stream ID, a receiver is required to open all
intervening streams of the same type; see [Section
3.2](#stream-recv-states){.xref}. Thus, on a new connection, opening
stream 4000000 opens 1 million and 1 client-initiated bidirectional
streams.[¶](#section-21.8-2){.pilcrow}

The number of active streams is limited by the initial_max_streams_bidi
and initial_max_streams_uni transport parameters as updated by any
received MAX_STREAMS frames, as explained in [Section
4.6](#controlling-concurrency){.xref}. If chosen judiciously, these
limits mitigate the effect of the stream commitment attack. However,
setting the limit too low could affect performance when applications
expect to open a large number of streams.[¶](#section-21.8-3){.pilcrow}

Stateless resets create a possible denial-of-service attack analogous to
a TCP reset injection. This attack is possible if an attacker is able to
cause a stateless reset token to be generated for a connection with a
selected connection ID. An attacker that can cause this token to be
generated can reset an active connection with the same connection
ID.[¶](#section-21.11-1){.pilcrow}

If a packet can be routed to different instances that share a static key
\-- for example, by changing an IP address or port \-- then an attacker
can cause the server to send a stateless reset. To defend against this
style of denial of service, endpoints that share a static key for
stateless resets (see [Section 10.3.2](#reset-token){.xref})
[MUST]{.bcp14} be arranged so that packets with a given connection ID
always arrive at an instance that has connection state, unless that
connection is no longer active.[¶](#section-21.11-2){.pilcrow}

More generally, servers [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} generate a stateless reset if
a connection with the corresponding connection ID could be active on any
endpoint using the same static key.[¶](#section-21.11-3){.pilcrow}

In the case of a cluster that uses dynamic load balancing, it is
possible that a change in load-balancer configuration could occur while
an active instance retains connection state. Even if an instance retains
connection state, the change in routing and resulting stateless reset
will result in the connection being terminated. If there is no chance of
the packet being routed to the correct instance, it is better to send a
stateless reset than wait for the connection to time out. However, this
is acceptable only if the routing cannot be influenced by an
attacker.[¶](#section-21.11-4){.pilcrow}

private use and experimentation with extensions to QUIC. Provisional
registrations only require the inclusion of the codepoint value and
contact information. However, provisional registrations could be
reclaimed and reassigned for another
purpose.[¶](#section-22.1.1-1){.pilcrow}

Provisional registrations require Expert Review, as defined in [Section
4.5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8126#section-4.5){.relref} of
\[[RFC8126](#RFC8126){.xref}\]. The designated expert or experts are
advised that only registrations for an excessive proportion of remaining
codepoint space or the very first unassigned value (see [Section
22.1.2](#iana-random){.xref}) can be
rejected.[¶](#section-22.1.1-2){.pilcrow}

Provisional registrations will include a Date field that indicates when
the registration was last updated. A request to update the date on any
provisional registration can be made without review from the designated
expert(s).[¶](#section-22.1.1-3){.pilcrow}

All QUIC registries include the following fields to support provisional
registration:[¶](#section-22.1.1-4){.pilcrow}

Provisional registrations [MAY]{.bcp14} omit the Specification and Notes
fields, plus any additional fields that might be required for a
permanent registration. The Date field is not required as part of
requesting a registration, as it is set to the date the registration is
created or updated.[¶](#section-22.1.1-6){.pilcrow}

#### [22.1.2.](#section-22.1.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Selecting Codepoints](#name-selecting-codepoints){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-selecting-codepoints}

New requests for codepoints from QUIC registries [SHOULD]{.bcp14} use a
randomly selected codepoint that excludes both existing allocations and
the first unallocated codepoint in the selected space. Requests for
multiple codepoints [MAY]{.bcp14} use a contiguous range. This minimizes
the risk that differing semantics are attributed to the same codepoint
by different implementations.[¶](#section-22.1.2-1){.pilcrow}

The use of the first unassigned codepoint is reserved for allocation
using the Standards Action policy; see [Section
4.9](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8126#section-4.9){.relref} of
\[[RFC8126](#RFC8126){.xref}\]. The early codepoint assignment process
\[[EARLY-ASSIGN](#EARLY-ASSIGN){.xref}\] can be used for these
values.[¶](#section-22.1.2-2){.pilcrow}

For codepoints that are encoded in variable-length integers ([Section
16](#integer-encoding){.xref}), such as frame types, codepoints that
encode to four or eight bytes (that is, values 2^14^ and above)
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} be used unless the usage is especially sensitive to
having a longer encoding.[¶](#section-22.1.2-3){.pilcrow}

Applications to register codepoints in QUIC registries [MAY]{.bcp14}
include a requested codepoint as part of the registration. IANA
[MUST]{.bcp14} allocate the selected codepoint if the codepoint is
unassigned and the requirements of the registration policy are
met.[¶](#section-22.1.2-4){.pilcrow}

A request might be made to remove an unused provisional registration
from the registry to reclaim space in a registry, or a portion of the
registry (such as the 64-16383 range for codepoints that use
variable-length encodings). This [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be done only for the
codepoints with the earliest recorded date, and entries that have been
updated less than a year prior [SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} be
reclaimed.[¶](#section-22.1.3-1){.pilcrow}

A request to remove a codepoint [MUST]{.bcp14} be reviewed by the
designated experts. The experts [MUST]{.bcp14} attempt to determine
whether the codepoint is still in use. Experts are advised to contact
the listed contacts for the registration, plus as wide a set of protocol
implementers as possible in order to determine whether any use of the
codepoint is known. The experts are also advised to allow at least four
weeks for responses.[¶](#section-22.1.3-2){.pilcrow}

If any use of the codepoints is identified by this search or a request
to update the registration is made, the codepoint [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be
reclaimed. Instead, the date on the registration is updated. A note
might be added for the registration recording relevant information that
was learned.[¶](#section-22.1.3-3){.pilcrow}

If no use of the codepoint was identified and no request was made to
update the registration, the codepoint [MAY]{.bcp14} be removed from the
registry.[¶](#section-22.1.3-4){.pilcrow}

This review and consultation process also applies to requests to change
a provisional registration into a permanent registration, except that
the goal is not to determine whether there is no use of the codepoint
but to determine that the registration is an accurate representation of
any deployed usage.[¶](#section-22.1.3-5){.pilcrow}

Permanent registrations in QUIC registries use the Specification
Required policy ([Section
4.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8126#section-4.6){.relref} of
\[[RFC8126](#RFC8126){.xref}\]), unless otherwise specified. The
designated expert or experts verify that a specification exists and is
readily accessible. Experts are encouraged to be biased towards
approving registrations unless they are abusive, frivolous, or actively
harmful (not merely aesthetically displeasing or architecturally
dubious). The creation of a registry [MAY]{.bcp14} specify additional
constraints on permanent registrations.[¶](#section-22.1.4-1){.pilcrow}

The creation of a registry [MAY]{.bcp14} identify a range of codepoints
where registrations are governed by a different registration policy. For
instance, the \"QUIC Frame Types\" registry ([Section
22.4](#iana-frames){.xref}) has a stricter policy for codepoints in the
range from 0 to 63.[¶](#section-22.1.4-2){.pilcrow}

Any stricter requirements for permanent registrations do not prevent
provisional registrations for affected codepoints. For instance, a
provisional registration for a frame type of 61 could be
requested.[¶](#section-22.1.4-3){.pilcrow}

All registrations made by Standards Track publications [MUST]{.bcp14} be
permanent.[¶](#section-22.1.4-4){.pilcrow}

All registrations in this document are assigned a permanent status and
list a change controller of the IETF and a contact of the QUIC Working
Group (quic\@ietf.org).[¶](#section-22.1.4-5){.pilcrow}

For example, if the highest successfully authenticated packet had a
packet number of 0xa82f30ea, then a packet containing a 16-bit value of
0x9b32 will be decoded as 0xa82f9b32.[¶](#section-a.3-5){.pilcrow}

## [A.4.](#section-a.4){.section-number .selfRef} [Sample ECN Validation Algorithm](#name-sample-ecn-validation-algor){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-sample-ecn-validation-algor}

Each time an endpoint commences sending on a new network path, it
determines whether the path supports ECN; see [Section
13.4](#ecn){.xref}. If the path supports ECN, the goal is to use ECN.
Endpoints might also periodically reassess a path that was determined to
not support ECN.[¶](#section-a.4-1){.pilcrow}

This section describes one method for testing new paths. This algorithm
is intended to show how a path might be tested for ECN support.
Endpoints can implement different methods.[¶](#section-a.4-2){.pilcrow}

The path is assigned an ECN state that is one of \"testing\",
\"unknown\", \"failed\", or \"capable\". On paths with a \"testing\" or
\"capable\" state, the endpoint sends packets with an ECT marking \--
ECT(0) by default; otherwise, the endpoint sends unmarked
packets.[¶](#section-a.4-3){.pilcrow}

To start testing a path, the ECN state is set to \"testing\", and
existing ECN counts are remembered as a
baseline.[¶](#section-a.4-4){.pilcrow}

The testing period runs for a number of packets or a limited time, as
determined by the endpoint. The goal is not to limit the duration of the
testing period but to ensure that enough marked packets are sent for
received ECN counts to provide a clear indication of how the path treats
marked packets. [Section 13.4.2](#ecn-validation){.xref} suggests
limiting this to ten packets or three times the
PTO.[¶](#section-a.4-5){.pilcrow}

After the testing period ends, the ECN state for the path becomes
\"unknown\". From the \"unknown\" state, successful validation of the
ECN counts in an ACK frame (see [Section 13.4.2.1](#ecn-ack){.xref})
causes the ECN state for the path to become \"capable\", unless no
marked packet has been acknowledged.[¶](#section-a.4-6){.pilcrow}

If validation of ECN counts fails at any time, the ECN state for the
affected path becomes \"failed\". An endpoint can also mark the ECN
state for a path as \"failed\" if marked packets are all declared lost
or if they are all ECN-CE marked.[¶](#section-a.4-7){.pilcrow}

Following this algorithm ensures that ECN is rarely disabled for paths
that properly support ECN. Any path that incorrectly modifies markings
will cause ECN to be disabled. For those rare cases where marked packets
are discarded by the path, the short duration of the testing period
limits the number of losses incurred.[¶](#section-a.4-8){.pilcrow}
