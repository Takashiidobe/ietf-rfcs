# RFC 8801 {#rfcnum}

# Discovering Provisioning Domain Names and Data {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

Provisioning Domains (PvDs) are defined as consistent sets of network
configuration information. PvDs allows hosts to manage connections to
multiple networks and interfaces simultaneously, such as when a home
router provides connectivity through both a broadband and cellular
network provider.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

This document defines a mechanism for explicitly identifying PvDs
through a Router Advertisement (RA) option. This RA option announces a
PvD identifier, which hosts can compare to differentiate between PvDs.
The option can directly carry some information about a PvD and can
optionally point to PvD Additional Information that can be retrieved
using HTTP over TLS.[¶](#section-abstract-2){.pilcrow}

Provisioning Domains (PvDs) are defined in
\[[RFC7556](#RFC7556){.xref}\] as consistent sets of network
configuration information. This information includes properties that are
traditionally associated with a single networking interface, such as
source addresses, DNS configuration, proxy configuration, and gateway
addresses.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

Clients that are aware of PvDs can take advantage of multiple network
interfaces simultaneously. This enables using two PvDs in parallel for
separate connections or for multi-path
transports.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

While most PvDs today are discovered implicitly (such as by receiving
information via Router Advertisements from a router on a network that a
client host directly connects to), \[[RFC7556](#RFC7556){.xref}\] also
defines the notion of Explicit PvDs. IPsec Virtual Private Networks are
considered Explicit PvDs, but Explicit PvDs can also be discovered via
the local network router. Discovering Explicit PvDs allows two key
advancements in managing multiple PvDs:[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

1.  [The ability to discover and use multiple PvDs on a single
    interface, such as when a local router can provide connectivity to
    two different Internet Service
    Providers.[¶](#section-1-4.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-4.1}
2.  [The ability to associate Additional Information about PvDs to
    describe the properties of the
    network.[¶](#section-1-4.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-4.2}

While \[[RFC7556](#RFC7556){.xref}\] defines the concept of Explicit
PvDs, it does not define the mechanism for discovering multiple Explicit
PvDs on a single network and their Additional
Information.[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}

This document specifies a way to identify PvDs with Fully Qualified
Domain Names (FQDNs), called PvD IDs. Those identifiers are advertised
in a new Router Advertisement (RA) \[[RFC4861](#RFC4861){.xref}\] option
called the PvD Option, which, when present, associates the PvD ID with
all the information present in the Router Advertisement as well as any
configuration object, such as addresses, derived from it. The PvD Option
may also contain a set of other RA options, along with an optional inner
Router Advertisement message header. These options and optional inner
header are only visible to \'PvD-aware\' hosts, allowing such hosts to
have a specialized view of the network
configuration.[¶](#section-1-6){.pilcrow}

Since PvD IDs are used to identify different ways to access the
Internet, multiple PvDs (with different PvD IDs) can be provisioned on a
single host interface. Similarly, the same PvD ID could be used on
different interfaces of a host in order to inform that those PvDs
ultimately provide equivalent services.[¶](#section-1-7){.pilcrow}

This document also introduces a mechanism for hosts to retrieve optional
Additional Information related to a specific PvD by means of an
HTTP-over-TLS query using a URI derived from the PvD ID. The retrieved
JSON object contains Additional Information that would typically be
considered too large to be directly included in the Router Advertisement
but might be considered useful to the applications, or even sometimes
users, when choosing which PvD should be
used.[¶](#section-1-8){.pilcrow}

For example, if Alice has both a cellular network provider and a
broadband provider in her home, her PvD-aware devices and applications
would be aware of both available uplinks. These applications could
fail-over between these networks or run connections over both
(potentially using multi-path transports). Applications could also
select specific uplinks based on the properties of the network; for
example, if the cellular network provides free high-quality video
streaming, a video-streaming application could select that network while
most of the other traffic on Alice\'s device uses the broadband
provider.[¶](#section-1-9){.pilcrow}

A router [MAY]{.bcp14} send RAs containing one PvD Option but [MUST
NOT]{.bcp14} include more than one PvD Option in each RA. The PvD Option
[MUST NOT]{.bcp14} contain further PvD
Options.[¶](#section-3.2-1){.pilcrow}

The PvD Option [MAY]{.bcp14} contain zero, one, or more RA options that
would otherwise be valid as part of the same RA. Such options are
processed by PvD-aware hosts and ignored by other hosts as per [Section
4.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4861#section-4.2){.relref} of
\[[RFC4861](#RFC4861){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3.2-2){.pilcrow}

In order to provide multiple different PvDs, a router [MUST]{.bcp14}
send multiple RAs. RAs sent from different link-local source addresses
establish distinct Implicit PvDs in the absence of a PvD Option.
Explicit PvDs [MAY]{.bcp14} share link-local source addresses with an
Implicit PvD and any number of other Explicit
PvDs.[¶](#section-3.2-3){.pilcrow}

In other words, different Explicit PvDs [MAY]{.bcp14} be advertised with
RAs using the same link-local source address, but different Implicit
PvDs, advertised by different RAs, [MUST]{.bcp14} use different
link-local addresses because these Implicit PvDs are identified by the
source addresses of the RAs. If a link-local address on the router is
changed, then any new RA will be interpreted as a different Implicit PvD
by PvD-aware hosts.[¶](#section-3.2-4){.pilcrow}

As specified in \[[RFC4861](#RFC4861){.xref}\] and
\[[RFC6980](#RFC6980){.xref}\], when the set of options causes the size
of an advertisement to exceed the link MTU, multiple router
advertisements [MUST]{.bcp14} be sent to avoid fragmentation, each
containing a subset of the options. In such cases, the PvD Option header
(i.e., all fields except the Options field) [MUST]{.bcp14} be repeated
in all the transmitted RAs. The options within the Options field
[MAY]{.bcp14} be transmitted only once, included in one of the
transmitted PvD Options.[¶](#section-3.2-5){.pilcrow}

As the PvD Option has a new option code, non-PvD-aware hosts will simply
ignore the PvD Option and all the options it contains (see [Section
4.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4861#section-4.2){.relref} of

required in [Section
3.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7556#section-3.3){.relref} of
\[[RFC7556](#RFC7556){.xref}\]. This behavior allows for a mixed-mode
network where a mix of PvD-aware and non-PvD-aware hosts
coexist.[¶](#section-3.3-1){.pilcrow}

### [3.4.](#section-3.4){.section-number .selfRef} [PvD-Aware Host Behavior](#name-pvd-aware-host-behavior){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-pvd-aware-host-behavior}

Hosts [MUST]{.bcp14} associate received RAs and included configuration
information (e.g., Router Valid Lifetime, Prefix Information
\[[RFC4861](#RFC4861){.xref}\], Recursive DNS Server
\[[RFC8106](#RFC8106){.xref}\], and Routing Information
\[[RFC4191](#RFC4191){.xref}\] options) with the Explicit PvD identified
by the first PvD Option present in the received RA, if any, or with the
Implicit PvD identified by the host interface and the source address of
the received RA otherwise. If an RA message header is present both
within the PvD Option and outside it, the header within the PvD Option
takes precedence.[¶](#section-3.4-1){.pilcrow}

In case multiple PvD Options are found in a given RA, hosts
[MUST]{.bcp14} ignore all but the first PvD
Option.[¶](#section-3.4-2){.pilcrow}

If a host receives PvD Options flags that it does not recognize
(currently in the Reserved field), it [MUST]{.bcp14} ignore these
flags.[¶](#section-3.4-3){.pilcrow}

Similarly, hosts [MUST]{.bcp14} associate all network configuration
objects (e.g., default routers, addresses, more specific routes, and DNS
Recursive Resolvers) with the PvD associated with the RA that
provisioned the object. For example, addresses that are generated using
a received Prefix Information Option (PIO) are associated with the PvD
of the last received RA that included the given
PIO.[¶](#section-3.4-4){.pilcrow}

PvD IDs [MUST]{.bcp14} be compared in a case-insensitive manner as
defined by \[[RFC4343](#RFC4343){.xref}\]. For example,
\"pvd.example.com.\" or \"PvD.Example.coM.\" would refer to the same
PvD.[¶](#section-3.4-5){.pilcrow}

While performing PvD-specific operations such as resolving names,
executing the default address selection algorithm
\[[RFC6724](#RFC6724){.xref}\], or executing the default router
selection algorithm when forwarding packets
\[[RFC4861](#RFC4861){.xref}\] \[[RFC4191](#RFC4191){.xref}\]
\[[RFC8028](#RFC8028){.xref}\], hosts and applications [MAY]{.bcp14}
consider only the configuration associated with any non-empty subset of
PvDs. For example, a host [MAY]{.bcp14} associate a given process with a
specific PvD, or a specific set of PvDs, while associating another
process with another PvD. A PvD-aware application might also be able to
select, on a per-connection basis, which PvDs should be used. In
particular, constrained devices such as small battery-operated devices
(e.g., Internet of Things (IoT)) or devices with limited CPU or memory
resources may purposefully use a single PvD while ignoring some received
RAs containing different PvD IDs.[¶](#section-3.4-6){.pilcrow}

The way an application expresses its desire to use a given PvD, or a set
of PvDs, and the way this selection is enforced are out of the scope of
this document. Useful insights about these considerations can be found
in

#### [3.4.1.](#section-3.4.1){.section-number .selfRef} [DHCPv6 Configuration Association](#name-dhcpv6-configuration-associ){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-dhcpv6-configuration-associ}

When a host retrieves stateless configuration elements using DHCPv6
(e.g., DNS recursive resolvers or DNS domain search lists
\[[RFC3646](#RFC3646){.xref}\]), they [MUST]{.bcp14} be associated with
all the Explicit and Implicit PvDs received on the same interface and
contained in an RA with the O-flag set
\[[RFC4861](#RFC4861){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3.4.1-1){.pilcrow}

When a host retrieves stateful assignments using DHCPv6, such
assignments [MUST]{.bcp14} be associated with the received PvD that was
received with RAs with the M-flag set and including a matching PIO. A
PIO is considered to match a DHCPv6 assignment when the IPv6 prefix from
the PIO includes the assignment from DHCPv6. For example, if a PvD\'s
associated PIO defines the prefix `2001:db8:cafe::/64`, a DHCPv6 IA_NA
message that assigns the address `2001:db8:cafe::1234:4567` would be
considered to match.[¶](#section-3.4.1-2){.pilcrow}

In cases where an address would be assigned by DHCPv6 and no matching
PvD could be found, hosts [MAY]{.bcp14} associate the assigned address
with any Implicit PvD received on the same interface or to multiple
Implicit PvDs received on the same interface. This is intended to
resolve backward-compatibility issues with rare deployments choosing to
assign addresses with DHCPv6 while not sending any matching PIO.
Implementations are suggested to flag or log such scenarios as errors to
help detect misconfigurations.[¶](#section-3.4.1-3){.pilcrow}

#### [3.4.2.](#section-3.4.2){.section-number .selfRef} [DHCPv4 Configuration Association](#name-dhcpv4-configuration-associ){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-dhcpv4-configuration-associ}

Associating DHCPv4 \[[RFC2131](#RFC2131){.xref}\] configuration elements
with Explicit PvDs allows hosts to treat a set of IPv4 and IPv6
configurations as a single PvD with shared properties. For example,
consider a router that provides two different uplinks. One could be a
broadband network that has data rate and streaming properties described
in PvD Additional Information and that provides both IPv4 and IPv6
network access. The other could be a cellular network that provides only
IPv6 network access and uses NAT64 \[[RFC6146](#RFC6146){.xref}\]. The
broadband network can be represented by an Explicit PvD that points to
the Additional Information and also marks association with DHCPv4
information. The cellular network can be represented by a different
Explicit PvD that is not associated with
DHCPv4.[¶](#section-3.4.2-1){.pilcrow}

When a PvD-aware host retrieves configuration elements from DHCPv4, the
information is associated either with a single Explicit PvD on that
interface or else with all Implicit PvDs on the same
interface.[¶](#section-3.4.2-2){.pilcrow}

An Explicit PvD indicates its association with DHCPv4 information by
setting the L-flag in the PvD Option. If there is exactly one Explicit
PvD that sets this flag, hosts [MUST]{.bcp14} associate the DHCPv4
information with that PvD. Multiple Explicit PvDs on the same interface
marking this flag is a misconfiguration, and hosts [SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14}
associate the DHCPv4 information with any Explicit PvD in this
case.[¶](#section-3.4.2-3){.pilcrow}

If no single Explicit PvD claims association with DHCPv4, the
configuration elements coming from DHCPv4 [MUST]{.bcp14} be associated
with all Implicit PvDs identified by the interface on which the DHCPv4
transaction happened. This maintains existing host
behavior.[¶](#section-3.4.2-4){.pilcrow}

The situation in which a host shares connectivity from an upstream
interface (e.g., cellular) to a downstream interface (e.g., Wi-Fi) is
known as \'tethering\'. Techniques such as ND Proxy
\[[RFC4389](#RFC4389){.xref}\], 64share \[[RFC7278](#RFC7278){.xref}\],
or prefix delegation (e.g., using DHCPv6-PD
\[[RFC8415](#RFC8415){.xref}\]) may be used for that
purpose.[¶](#section-3.4.3-1){.pilcrow}

Whenever the RAs received from the upstream interface contain a PvD
Option, hosts that are sharing connectivity [SHOULD]{.bcp14} include a
PvD Option within the RAs sent downstream
with:[¶](#section-3.4.3-2){.pilcrow}

The values of the R-flag, Router Advertisement message header, and
Options field depend on whether or not the connectivity should be shared
only with PvD-aware hosts (see [Section 3.2](#router){.xref}). In

PvD-aware hosts can be provisioned with recursive DNS servers via RA
options passed within an Explicit PvD, via RA options associated with an
Implicit PvD, via DHCPv6 or DHCPv4, or from some other provisioning
mechanism that creates an Explicit PvD (such as a VPN). In all of these
cases, the recursive DNS server addresses [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be associated
with the corresponding PvD. Specifically, queries sent to a configured
recursive DNS server [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be sent from a local IP address
that was provisioned for the PvD via RA or DHCP. Answers received from
the DNS server [SHOULD]{.bcp14} only be used on the same
PvD.[¶](#section-3.4.4-1){.pilcrow}

PvD-aware applications will be able to select which PvD(s) to use for
DNS resolution and connections, which allows them to effectively use
multiple Explicit PvDs. In order to support non-PvD-aware applications,
however, PvD-aware hosts [SHOULD]{.bcp14} ensure that non-PvD-aware name
resolution APIs like \"getaddrinfo\" only use resolvers from a single
PvD for a given query. Handling DNS across PvDs is discussed in [Section

the certificate is equal to the PvD ID expressed as an FQDN. This
validation indicates that the owner of the FQDN authorizes its use with
the prefix advertised by the router. If this validation fails, hosts
[MUST]{.bcp14} close the connection and treat the PvD as if it has no
Additional Information.[¶](#section-4.1-3){.pilcrow}

HTTP requests and responses for PvD Additional Information use the
\"application/pvd+json\" media type (see [Section
8.5](#pvd-json-media-type-registration){.xref}). Clients
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} include this media type as an Accept header field in
their GET requests, and servers [MUST]{.bcp14} mark this media type as
their Content-Type header field in
responses.[¶](#section-4.1-4){.pilcrow}

Note that the DNS name resolution of the PvD ID, any connections made
for certificate validation (such as Online Certificate Status Protocol
(OCSP) \[[RFC6960](#RFC6960){.xref}\]), and the HTTP request itself
[MUST]{.bcp14} be performed using the considered PvD. In other words,
the name resolution, PKI checks, source address selection, as well as
the next-hop router selection [MUST]{.bcp14} be performed while
exclusively using the set of configuration information attached with the
PvD, as defined in [Section 3.4](#host){.xref}. In some cases, it may
therefore be necessary to wait for an address to be available for use
(e.g., once the Duplicate Address Detection or DHCPv6 processes are
complete) before initiating the HTTP-over-TLS query. In order to address
privacy concerns around linkability of the PvD HTTP connection with
future user-initiated connections, if the host has a temporary address
per \[[RFC4941](#RFC4941){.xref}\] in this PvD, then it [SHOULD]{.bcp14}
use a temporary address to fetch the PvD Additional Information and
[MAY]{.bcp14} deprecate the used temporary address and generate a new
temporary address afterward.[¶](#section-4.1-5){.pilcrow}

If the HTTP status of the answer is greater than or equal to 400, the
host [MUST]{.bcp14} close its connection and consider that there is no
PvD Additional Information. If the HTTP status of the answer is between
300 and 399, inclusive, it [MUST]{.bcp14} follow the redirection(s). If
the HTTP status of the answer is between 200 and 299, inclusive, the
response is expected to be a single JSON
object.[¶](#section-4.1-6){.pilcrow}

After retrieval of the PvD Additional Information, hosts [MUST]{.bcp14}
remember the last Sequence Number value received in an RA including the
same PvD ID. Whenever a new RA for the same PvD is received with a
different Sequence Number value, or whenever the expiry date for the
additional information is reached, hosts [MUST]{.bcp14} deprecate the
Additional Information and stop using it.[¶](#section-4.1-7){.pilcrow}

Hosts retrieving a new PvD Additional Information object [MUST]{.bcp14}
check for the presence and validity of the mandatory fields specified in
[Section 4.3](#aiformat){.xref}. A retrieved object including an
expiration time that is already past or missing a mandatory element
[MUST]{.bcp14} be ignored.[¶](#section-4.1-8){.pilcrow}

In order to avoid synchronized queries toward the server hosting the PvD
Additional Information when an object expires, object updates are
delayed by a randomized backoff time.[¶](#section-4.1-9){.pilcrow}

-   [When a host performs a JSON object update after it detected a
    change in the PvD Option Sequence Number, it [MUST]{.bcp14} add a
    delay before sending the query. The target time for the delay is
    calculated as a random time between zero and 2^(10 +\ Delay)^
    milliseconds, where \'Delay\' corresponds to the 4-bit unsigned
    integer in the last received PvD
    Option.[¶](#section-4.1-10.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.1-10.1}
-   [When a host last retrieved a JSON object at time A that includes an
    expiry time B using the \"expires\" key, and the host is configured
    to keep the PvD Additional Information up to date, it [MUST]{.bcp14}
    add some randomness into its calculation of the time to fetch the
    update. The target time for fetching the updated object is
    calculated as a uniformly random time in the interval
    \[(B-A)/2,B\].[¶](#section-4.1-10.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.1-10.2}

In the example in [Figure 2](#pvd_example){.xref}, the Delay field value
is 1; this means that the host calculates its delay by choosing a
uniformly random time between 0 and 2^(10\ +\ 1)^ milliseconds, i.e.,
between 0 and 2048 milliseconds.[¶](#section-4.1-11){.pilcrow}

Since the Delay value is directly within the PvD Option rather than the
object itself, an operator may perform a push-based update by
incrementing the Sequence Number value while changing the Delay value
depending on the criticality of the update and the capacity of its PvD
Additional Information servers.[¶](#section-4.1-12){.pilcrow}

In addition to adding a random delay when fetching Additional
Information, hosts [MUST]{.bcp14} enforce a minimum time between
requesting Additional Information for a given PvD on the same network.
This minimum time is [RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14} to be 10 seconds, in order to
avoid hosts causing a denial-of-service on the PvD server. Hosts also
[MUST]{.bcp14} limit the number of requests that are made to different
PvD Additional Information servers on the same network within a short
period of time. A [RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14} value is to issue no more than
five PvD Additional Information requests in total on a given network
within 10 seconds. For more discussion, see [Section
6](#security){.xref}.[¶](#section-4.1-13){.pilcrow}

The PvD Additional Information object includes a set of IPv6 prefixes
(under the key \"prefixes\") that [MUST]{.bcp14} be checked against all
the Prefix Information Options advertised in the RA. If any of the
prefixes included in any associated PIO is not covered by at least one
of the listed prefixes, the PvD Additional Information [MUST]{.bcp14} be
considered to be a misconfiguration and [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be used by
the host. See [Section 4.4](#misconfig){.xref} for more discussion on
handling such misconfigurations.[¶](#section-4.1-14){.pilcrow}

If the request for PvD Additional Information fails due to a TLS
certificate validation error, an HTTP error, or because the retrieved
file does not contain valid PvD JSON, hosts [MUST]{.bcp14} close any
connection used to fetch the PvD Additional Information and [MUST
NOT]{.bcp14} request the information for that PvD ID again for the
duration of the local network attachment. If a host detects 10 or more
such failures to fetch PvD Additional Information, the local network is
assumed to be misconfigured or under attack and the host [MUST
NOT]{.bcp14} make any further requests for any PvD Additional
Information, belonging to any PvD ID, for the duration of the local
network attachment. For more discussion, see [Section

Hosts [MUST]{.bcp14} validate the TLS server certificate when retrieving
PvD Additional Information, as detailed in [Section
4.1](#retr){.xref}.[¶](#section-4.4-1){.pilcrow}

Hosts [MUST]{.bcp14} verify that all prefixes in all the RA PIOs are
covered by a prefix from the PvD Additional Information. An adversarial
router attempting to spoof the definition of an Explicit PvD, without
the ability to modify the PvD Additional Information, would need to
perform IPv6-to-IPv6 Network Prefix Translation (NPTv6)
\[[RFC6296](#RFC6296){.xref}\] in order to circumvent this check. Thus,
this check cannot prevent all spoofing, but it can detect
misconfiguration or mismatched routers that are not adding a
NAT.[¶](#section-4.4-2){.pilcrow}

If NPTv6 is being added in order to spoof PvD ownership, the HTTPS
server for Additional Information can detect this misconfiguration. The
HTTPS server [SHOULD]{.bcp14} validate the source addresses of incoming
connections (see [Section 4.1](#retr){.xref}). This check gives
reasonable assurance that NPTv6 was not used and restricts the
information to the valid network users.If the PvD does not provision
IPv4 (it does not include the L-flag in the RA), the server cannot
validate the source addresses of connections using IPv4. Thus, the PvD
ID FQDN for such PvDs [SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} have a DNS A
record.[¶](#section-4.4-3){.pilcrow}

It is expected that for some years, networks will have a mixed

A PvD-aware host will fetch \<https://cafe.example.com/.well-known/pvd>

At this point, the host has the PvD Additional Information and knows the
expiry time. When either the expiry time passes or a new Sequence Number
is provided in an RA, the host will re-fetch the Additional
Information.[¶](#section-5.4-7){.pilcrow}

For example, if the router sends a new RA with the Sequence Number set
to 8, the host will re-fetch the Additional
Information:[¶](#section-5.4-8){.pilcrow}

-   [PvD Option header: length = 3 + 5 + 4 , PvD ID FQDN =

    bytes)[¶](#section-5.4-9.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.4-9.1}

However, if the router sends a new RA, but the Sequence Number has not
changed, the host would not re-fetch the Additional Information (until
and unless the expiry time of the Additional Information has
passed).[¶](#section-5.4-10){.pilcrow}

## [6.](#section-6){.section-number .selfRef} [Security Considerations](#name-security-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-security-considerations}

Since the PvD Option can contain an RA header and other RA options, any
security considerations that apply for specific RA options continue to
apply when used within a PvD Option.[¶](#section-6-1){.pilcrow}

Although some solutions such as IPsec or SEcure Neighbor Discovery
(SeND) \[[RFC3971](#RFC3971){.xref}\] can be used in order to secure the
IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Protocol, in practice, actual deployments
largely rely on link-layer or physical-layer security mechanisms (e.g.,
802.1x \[[IEEE8021X](#IEEE8021X){.xref}\]) in conjunction with RA-Guard
\[[RFC6105](#RFC6105){.xref}\].[¶](#section-6-2){.pilcrow}

If multiple RAs are sent for a single PvD to avoid fragmentation,
dropping packets can lead to processing only part of a PvD Option, which
could lead to hosts receiving only part of the contained options. As
discussed in [Section 3.2](#router){.xref}, routers [MUST]{.bcp14}
include the PvD Option in all fragments
generated.[¶](#section-6-3){.pilcrow}

This specification does not improve the Neighbor Discovery Protocol
security model but simply validates that the owner of the PvD FQDN
authorizes its use with the prefix advertised by the router. In
combination with implicit trust in the local router (if present), this
gives the host some level of assurance that the PvD is authorized for
use in this environment. However, when the local router cannot be
trusted, no such guarantee is available.[¶](#section-6-4){.pilcrow}

It must be noted that [Section 4.4](#misconfig){.xref} of this document
only provides reasonable assurance against misconfiguration but does not
prevent a hostile network access provider from advertising incorrect
information that could lead applications or hosts to select a hostile
PvD. However, a host that correctly implements the multiple PvD
architecture \[[RFC7556](#RFC7556){.xref}\] using the mechanism
described in this document will be less susceptible to some attacks than
a host that does not by being able to check for the various
misconfigurations or inconsistencies described in this
document.[¶](#section-6-5){.pilcrow}

Since expiration times provided in PvD Additional Information use
absolute time, these values can be skewed due to clock skew or for hosts
without an accurate time base. Such time values [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be
used for security-sensitive functionality or
decisions.[¶](#section-6-6){.pilcrow}

An attacker generating RAs on a local network can use the H-flag and the
PvD ID to cause hosts on the network to make requests for PvD Additional
Information from servers. This can become a denial-of-service attack, in
which an attacker can amplify its attack by triggering TLS connections
to arbitrary servers in response to sending UDP packets containing RA
messages. To mitigate this attack, hosts
[MUST]{.bcp14}:[¶](#section-6-7){.pilcrow}

-   [limit the rate at which they fetch a particular PvD\'s Additional
    Information;[¶](#section-6-8.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-6-8.1}
-   [limit the rate at which they fetch any PvD Additional Information
    on a given local
    network;[¶](#section-6-8.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-6-8.2}
-   [stop making requests for a PvD ID that does not respond with valid
    JSON; and[¶](#section-6-8.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-6-8.3}
-   [stop making requests for all PvD IDs once a certain number of
    failures is reached on a particular
    network.[¶](#section-6-8.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-6-8.4}

Details are provided in [Section 4.1](#retr){.xref}. This attack can be
targeted at generic web servers, in which case the host behavior of
stopping requesting for any server that doesn\'t behave like a PvD
Additional Information server is critical. Limiting requests for a
specific PvD ID might not be sufficient if the attacker changes the PvD
ID values quickly, so hosts also need to stop requesting if they detect
consistent failure when on a network that is under attack. For cases in
which an attacker is pointing hosts at a valid PvD Additional
Information server (but one that is not actually associated with the
local network), the server [SHOULD]{.bcp14} reject any requests that do
not originate from the expected IPv6 prefix as described in [Section
4.2](#serverop){.xref}.[¶](#section-6-9){.pilcrow}

::: {#privacy-considerations}
::: {#section-7 .section}
## [7.](#section-7){.section-number .selfRef} [Privacy Considerations](#name-privacy-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-privacy-considerations}

Retrieval of the PvD Additional Information over HTTPS requires early
communications between the connecting host and a server that may be
located further than the first-hop router. Although this server is
likely to be located within the same administrative domain as the
default router, this property can\'t be ensured. To minimize the leakage
of identity information while retrieving the PvD Additional Information,
hosts [SHOULD]{.bcp14} make use of an IPv6 temporary address and [SHOULD
NOT]{.bcp14} include any privacy-sensitive data, such as a User-Agent
header field or an HTTP cookie.[¶](#section-7-1){.pilcrow}

Hosts might not always fetch PvD Additional Information, depending on
whether or not they expect to use the information. However, if a host
allows requesting Additional Information for certain PvD IDs, an
attacker could send various PvD IDs in RAs to detect which PvD IDs are
allowed by the client. To avoid this, hosts [SHOULD]{.bcp14} either
fetch Additional Information for all eligible PvD IDs on a given local
network or fetch the information for none of
them.[¶](#section-7-2){.pilcrow}

From a user privacy perspective, retrieving the PvD Additional
Information is not different from establishing a first connection to a
remote server or even performing a single DNS lookup. For example, most
operating systems already perform early queries to static web sites,
such as \<http://captive.example.com/hotspot-detect.html>, in order to
detect the presence of a captive portal.[¶](#section-7-3){.pilcrow}

The DNS queries associated with the PvD Additional Information
[MUST]{.bcp14} use the DNS servers indicated by the associated PvD, as
described in [Section 4.1](#retr){.xref}. This ensures the name of the
PvD Additional Information server is not unintentionally sent on another
network, thus leaking identifying information about the networks with
which the client is associated.[¶](#section-7-4){.pilcrow}

There may be some cases where hosts, for privacy reasons, should refrain
from accessing servers that are located outside a certain network
boundary. In practice, this could be implemented as an allowed list of
\'trusted\' FQDNs and/or IP prefixes that the host is allowed to
communicate with. In such scenarios, the host [SHOULD]{.bcp14} check
that the provided PvD ID, as well as the IP address that it resolves
into, are part of the allowed list.[¶](#section-7-5){.pilcrow}

Network operators [SHOULD]{.bcp14} restrict access to PvD Additional
Information to only expose it to hosts that are connected to the local
network, especially if the Additional Information would provide
information about local network configuration to attackers. This can be
implemented by allowing access from the addresses and prefixes that the
router provides for the PvD, which will match the prefixes contained in
the PvD Additional Information. This technique is described in [Section
4.2](#serverop){.xref}.[¶](#section-7-6){.pilcrow}
