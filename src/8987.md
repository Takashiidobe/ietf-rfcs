# DHCPv6 Prefix Delegating Relay Requirements {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

This document describes operational problems that are known to occur
when using DHCPv6 relays with prefix delegation. These problems can
prevent successful delegation and result in routing failures. To address
these problems, this document provides necessary functional requirements
for operating DHCPv6 relays with prefix
delegation.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

It is recommended that any network operator using DHCPv6 prefix
delegation with relays ensure that these requirements are followed on
their networks.[¶](#section-abstract-2){.pilcrow}

## [1.](#section-1){.section-number .selfRef} [Introduction](#name-introduction){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-introduction}

For Internet service providers that offer native IPv6 access with prefix
delegation to their customers, a common deployment architecture is to
have a DHCPv6 relay agent function located in the ISP\'s Layer 3
customer edge device and a separate, centralized DHCPv6 server
infrastructure. \[[RFC8415](#RFC8415){.xref}\] describes the
functionality of a DHCPv6 relay, and [Section
19.1.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8415#section-19.1.3){.relref}
of \[[RFC8415](#RFC8415){.xref}\] mentions this deployment scenario, but
it does not provide details for all of the functional requirements that
the relay needs to fulfill to operate deterministically in this
deployment scenario.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

A DHCPv6 relay agent for prefix delegation is a function commonly
implemented in routing devices, but implementations vary in their
functionality and client/server interworking. This can result in
operational problems such as messages not being forwarded by the relay
or unreachability of the delegated prefixes. This document provides a
set of requirements for devices implementing a relay function for use
with prefix delegation.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

The mechanisms for a relay to inject routes (including aggregated ones)
on its network-facing interface based on prefixes learned from a server
via DHCP prefix delegation (DHCP-PD) are out of scope of the
document.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

Multi-hop DHCPv6 relaying is not affected. The requirements in this
document are solely applicable to the DHCP relay agent co-located with
the first-hop router to which the DHCPv6 client requesting the prefix is
connected, so no changes to any subsequent relays in the path are
needed.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

### [2.1.](#section-2.1){.section-number .selfRef} [General](#name-general){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-general}

This document uses the terminology defined in
\[[RFC8415](#RFC8415){.xref}\]. However, when defining the functional
elements for prefix delegation, \[[RFC8415](#RFC8415){.xref}\], [Section
4.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8415#section-4.2){.relref}
defines the term \"delegating router\" as:[¶](#section-2.1-1){.pilcrow}

> The router that acts as a DHCP server and responds to requests for
> delegated prefixes.[¶](#section-2.1-2){.pilcrow}

This document is concerned with deployment scenarios in which the DHCPv6
relay and DHCPv6 server functions are separated, so the term
\"delegating router\" is not used. Instead, a new term is introduced to
describe the relaying function:[¶](#section-2.1-3){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

Delegating relay:
:   A delegating relay acts as an intermediate device, forwarding DHCPv6
    messages containing IA_PD and IAPREFIX options between the client
    and server. The delegating relay does not implement a DHCPv6 server
    function. The delegating relay is also responsible for routing
    traffic for the delegated prefixes.[¶](#section-2.1-4.2){.pilcrow}
:   

Where the term \"relay\" is used on its own within this document, it
should be understood to be a delegating relay unless specifically stated
otherwise.[¶](#section-2.1-5){.pilcrow}

In CableLabs DOCSIS environments, the Cable Modem Termination System
(CMTS) would be considered a delegating relay with respect to Customer
Premises Devices (CPEs) (\[[DOCSIS_3.1](#DOCSIS_3.1){.xref}\], Section
5.2.7.2). A Broadband Network Gateway (BNG) in a DSL-based access
network may be a delegating relay if it does not implement a local
DHCPv6 server function (\[[TR-092](#TR-092){.xref}\], Section
4.10).[¶](#section-2.1-6){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC8415](#RFC8415){.xref}\] defines the \"DHCP server\" (or
\"server\") as:[¶](#section-2.1-7){.pilcrow}

> A node that responds to requests from clients. It may or may not be on
> the same link as the client(s). Depending on its capabilities, if it
> supports prefix delegation it may also feature the functionality of a
> delegating router.[¶](#section-2.1-8){.pilcrow}

This document serves the deployment cases where a DHCPv6 server is not
located on the same link as the client (necessitating the delegating
relay). The server supports prefix delegation and is capable of leasing
prefixes to clients, but it is not responsible for other functions
required of a delegating router, such as managing routes for the
delegated prefixes.[¶](#section-2.1-9){.pilcrow}

The term \"requesting router\" has previously been used to describe the
DHCP client requesting prefixes for use. This document adopts the
terminology of \[[RFC8415](#RFC8415){.xref}\] and uses \"DHCP client\"
or \"client\" interchangeably for this
element.[¶](#section-2.1-10){.pilcrow}

The client requests prefixes via the downlink interface of the
delegating relay. The resulting prefixes will be used for addressing the
client network. The delegating relay is responsible for forwarding DHCP
messages, including prefix delegation requests and responses between the
client and server. Messages are forwarded from the delegating relay to
the server using multicast or unicast via the operator uplink
interface.[¶](#section-2.2-3){.pilcrow}

The delegating relay provides the operator\'s Layer 3 edge towards the
client and is responsible for routing traffic to and from clients
connected to the client network using addresses from the delegated
prefixes.[¶](#section-2.2-4){.pilcrow}

The following sections of the document describe problems that have been
observed with delegating relay implementations in commercially available
devices.[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-3.1 .section}
### [3.1.](#section-3.1){.section-number .selfRef} [DHCP Messages Not Being Forwarded by the Delegating Relay](#name-dhcp-messages-not-being-for){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-dhcp-messages-not-being-for}

Delegating relay implementations have been observed not to forward
messages between the client and server. This generally occurs if a
client sends a message that is unexpected by the delegating relay. For
example, the delegating relay already has an active PD lease entry for
an existing client on a port. A new client is connected to this port and
sends a Solicit message. The delegating relay then drops the Solicit
messages until either it receives a DHCP Release message from the
original client or the existing lease times out. This causes a
particular problem when a client device needs to be replaced due to a
failure.[¶](#section-3.1-1){.pilcrow}

In addition to dropping messages, in some cases, the delegating relay
will generate error messages and send them to the client, e.g.,
\"NoBinding\" messages being sent in the event that the delegating relay
does not have an active delegated prefix
lease.[¶](#section-3.1-2){.pilcrow}

For proper routing of client traffic, the delegating relay requires a
corresponding routing table entry for each active prefix delegated to a
connected client. A delegating relay that does not store this state
persistently across reboots will not be able to forward traffic to the
client\'s delegated leases until the state is reestablished through new
DHCP messages.[¶](#section-3.2-1){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-3.3 .section}
### [3.3.](#section-3.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Multiple Delegated Prefixes for a Single Client](#name-multiple-delegated-prefixes){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-multiple-delegated-prefixes}

DHCPv6 \[[RFC8415](#RFC8415){.xref}\] allows a client to include more
than one instance of OPTION_IA_PD in messages in order to request
multiple prefix delegations by the server. If configured for this, the
server supplies one (or more) instance of OPTION_IAPREFIX for each
received instance of OPTION_IA_PD, each containing information for a
different delegated prefix.[¶](#section-3.3-1){.pilcrow}

In some delegating relay implementations, only a single delegated prefix
per DHCP Unique Identifier (DUID) is supported. In those cases, only one
IPv6 route for one of the delegated prefixes is installed, meaning that
other prefixes delegated to a client are
unreachable.[¶](#section-3.3-2){.pilcrow}
:::

::: {#section-3.4 .section}
### [3.4.](#section-3.4){.section-number .selfRef} [Dropping Messages from Devices with Duplicate MAC Addresses and DUIDs](#name-dropping-messages-from-devi){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-dropping-messages-from-devi}

It is an operational reality that client devices with duplicate Media
Access Control (MAC) addresses and/or DUIDs exist and have been
deployed. In some networks, the operational costs of locating and
swapping out such devices are prohibitive.[¶](#section-3.4-1){.pilcrow}

Delegating relays have been observed to restrict forwarding client
messages originating from one client DUID to a single interface. In this
case, if the same client DUID appears from a second client on another
interface while there is already an active lease, messages originating
from the second client are dropped, causing the second client to be
unable to obtain a prefix delegation.[¶](#section-3.4-2){.pilcrow}

It should be noted that in some access networks, the MAC address and/or
DUID are used as part of device identification and authentication. In
such networks, enforcing uniqueness of the MAC address and/or DUID is a
necessary function and is not considered a
problem.[¶](#section-3.4-3){.pilcrow}

### [3.5.](#section-3.5){.section-number .selfRef} [Forwarding Loops between Client and Relay](#name-forwarding-loops-between-cl){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-forwarding-loops-between-cl}

If the client loses information about an active prefix lease it has been
delegated while the lease entry and associated route are still active in
the delegating relay, then the relay will forward traffic to the client.
The client will return this traffic to the relay, which is the client\'s
default gateway (learned via a Router Advertisement (RA)). The loop will
continue until either the client is successfully reprovisioned via DHCP
or the lease ages out in the relay.[¶](#section-3.5-1){.pilcrow}

    dynamically updated with leases and the associated next hops as they
    are delegated to clients. When a delegated prefix is released or

R-3:
:   The relay [MUST]{.bcp14} provide a mechanism to dynamically update
    ingress filters permitting ingress traffic sourced from client
    delegated leases and blocking packets from invalid source prefixes.
    This is to implement anti-spoofing as described in
    \[[BCP38](#BCP38){.xref}\]. The delegating relay\'s ingress filter
    entry [MUST]{.bcp14} use the same prefix length for the delegated
    prefix as given in the IA_PD.[¶](#section-4.2-1.3){.pilcrow}

R-4:
:   The relay [MAY]{.bcp14} provide a mechanism to dynamically advertise
    delegated leases into a routing protocol as they are learned. If
    such a mechanism is implemented, when a delegated lease is released
    or expires, the delegated route [MUST]{.bcp14} be withdrawn from the
    routing protocol. The mechanism by which the routes are inserted and
    deleted is out of the scope of this
    document.[¶](#section-4.2-1.4){.pilcrow}

    configurable policy to drop potential looping packets received on
    any DHCP-PD client-facing
    interfaces.[¶](#section-4.2-1.5.1){.pilcrow}

    The policy [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be configurable on a per-client or
    per-destination basis.[¶](#section-4.2-1.5.2){.pilcrow}

    Looping packets are those with a destination address in a prefix
