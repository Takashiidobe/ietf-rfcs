TLS 1.3 \[[RFC8446](#RFC8446){.xref}\] supports Pre-Shared Key (PSK)
authentication, wherein PSKs can be established via session tickets from
prior connections or via some external, out-of-band mechanism. The
protocol mandates that each PSK only be used with a single hash
function. This was done to simplify protocol analysis. TLS 1.2
\[[RFC5246](#RFC5246){.xref}\], in contrast, has no such requirement, as
a PSK may be used with any hash algorithm and the TLS 1.2 pseudorandom
function (PRF). While there is no known way in which the same external
PSK might produce related output in TLS 1.3 and prior versions, only
limited analysis has been done. Applications [SHOULD]{.bcp14} provision
separate PSKs for (D)TLS 1.3 and prior versions. In cases where this is
not possible (e.g., there are already-deployed external PSKs or
provisioning is otherwise limited), reusing external PSKs across
different versions of TLS may produce related outputs, which may, in
turn, lead to security problems; see [Appendix
E.7](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8446#appendix-E.7){.relref} of
\[[RFC8446](#RFC8446){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

To mitigate such problems, this document specifies a PSK importer
interface by which external PSKs may be imported and subsequently bound
to a specific key derivation function (KDF) and hash function for use in
TLS 1.3 \[[RFC8446](#RFC8446){.xref}\] and DTLS 1.3
\[[RFC9147](#RFC9147){.xref}\]. In particular, it describes a mechanism
for importing PSKs derived from external PSKs by including the target
KDF, (D)TLS protocol version, and an optional context string to ensure
uniqueness. This process yields a set of candidate PSKs, each of which
are bound to a target KDF and protocol, that are separate from those
used in (D)TLS 1.2 and prior versions. This expands what would normally
have been a single PSK and identity into a set of PSKs and
identities.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

The PSK importer interface mirrors that of the TLS exporter interface
(see \[[RFC8446](#RFC8446){.xref}\]) in that it diversifies a key based
on some contextual information. In contrast to the exporter interface,
wherein output uniqueness is achieved via an explicit label and context
string, the PSK importer interface defined herein takes an external PSK
and identity and \"imports\" it into TLS, creating a set of \"derived\"
PSKs and identities that are each unique. Each of these derived PSKs are
bound to a target protocol, KDF identifier, and optional context string.
Additionally, the resulting PSK binder keys are modified with a new
derivation label to prevent confusion with non-imported PSKs. Through
this interface, importing external PSKs with different identities yields
distinct PSK binder keys.[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

Imported keys do not require negotiation for use since a client and
server will not agree upon identities if imported incorrectly. Endpoints
may incrementally deploy PSK importer support by offering non-imported
PSKs for TLS versions prior to TLS 1.3. Non-imported and imported PSKs
are not equivalent since their identities are different. See [Section
7](#rollout){.xref} for more details.[¶](#section-4-2){.pilcrow}

Endpoints that import external keys [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} use the keys that
are input to the import process for any purpose other than the importer,
and they [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} use the derived keys for any purpose other
than TLS PSKs. Moreover, each external PSK fed to the importer process
[MUST]{.bcp14} be associated with one hash function at most. This is
analogous to the rules in [Section
4.2.11](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8446#section-4.2.11){.relref}
of \[[RFC8446](#RFC8446){.xref}\]. See [Section

This section describes the PSK importer interface and its underlying
diversification mechanism and binder key computation
modification.[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

::: {#external-psk-diversification}
::: {#section-5.1 .section}
### [5.1.](#section-5.1){.section-number .selfRef} [External PSK Diversification](#name-external-psk-diversificatio){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-external-psk-diversificatio}

As input, the PSK importer interface takes an EPSK with External
Identity `external_identity` and base key `epsk` (as defined in [Section
3](#terminology){.xref}) along with an optional context. It then
transforms the input into a set of PSKs and imported identities for use
in a connection based on target protocols and KDFs. In particular, for
each supported target protocol `target_protocol` and KDF `target_kdf`,
the importer constructs an ImportedIdentity structure as
follows:[¶](#section-5.1-1){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-5.1-2}
``` sourcecode
struct {
   opaque external_identity<1...2^16-1>;
   opaque context<0..2^16-1>;
   uint16 target_protocol;
   uint16 target_kdf;
} ImportedIdentity;
```

[¶](#section-5.1-2){.pilcrow}
:::

The list of ImportedIdentity.target_kdf values is maintained by IANA as
described in [Section 10](#IANA){.xref}. External PSKs [MUST
NOT]{.bcp14} be imported for (D)TLS 1.2 or prior versions. See [Section
7](#rollout){.xref} for discussion on how imported PSKs for TLS 1.3 and
non-imported PSKs for earlier versions coexist for incremental
deployment.[¶](#section-5.1-3){.pilcrow}

ImportedIdentity.context [MUST]{.bcp14} include the context used to
determine the EPSK, if any exists. For example, ImportedIdentity.context
may include information about peer roles or identities to mitigate
Selfie-style reflection attacks \[[Selfie](#Selfie){.xref}\]. See
[Appendix A](#mitigate-selfie){.xref} for more details. Since the EPSK
is a key derived from an external protocol or sequence of protocols,
ImportedIdentity.context [MUST]{.bcp14} include a channel binding for
the deriving protocols \[[RFC5056](#RFC5056){.xref}\]. The details of
this binding are protocol specific and out of scope for this
document.[¶](#section-5.1-4){.pilcrow}

ImportedIdentity.target_protocol [MUST]{.bcp14} be the (D)TLS protocol
version for which the PSK is being imported. For example, TLS 1.3
\[[RFC8446](#RFC8446){.xref}\] uses 0x0304, which will therefore also be
used by QUICv1 \[[QUIC](#RFC9000){.xref}\]. Note that this means the
number of PSKs derived from an EPSK is a function of the number of
target protocols.[¶](#section-5.1-5){.pilcrow}

Given an ImportedIdentity and corresponding EPSK with base key `epsk`,
an imported PSK IPSK with base key `ipskx` is computed as
follows:[¶](#section-5.1-6){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-5.1-7 .alignLeft .art-text .artwork}
       epskx = HKDF-Extract(0, epsk)
       ipskx = HKDF-Expand-Label(epskx, "derived psk",
                                 Hash(ImportedIdentity), L)

[¶](#section-5.1-7){.pilcrow}
:::

L corresponds to the KDF output length of ImportedIdentity.target_kdf as
defined in [Section 10](#IANA){.xref}. For hash-based KDFs, such as
HKDF_SHA256 (0x0001), this is the length of the hash function output,
e.g., 32 octets for SHA256. This is required for the IPSK to be of
length suitable for supported ciphersuites. Internally,
HKDF-Expand-Label uses a label corresponding to
ImportedIdentity.target_protocol (e.g., \"tls13\" for TLS 1.3, as per
[Section
7.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8446#section-7.1){.relref} of
\[[RFC8446](#RFC8446){.xref}\] or \"dtls13\" for DTLS 1.3, as per
[Section
5.10](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9147#section-5.10){.relref} of
\[[RFC9147](#RFC9147){.xref}\]).[¶](#section-5.1-8){.pilcrow}

The identity of `ipskx` as sent on the wire is ImportedIdentity, i.e.,
the serialized content of ImportedIdentity is used as the content of
PskIdentity.identity in the PSK extension. The corresponding PSK input
for the TLS 1.3 key schedule is \"ipskx\".[¶](#section-5.1-9){.pilcrow}

As the maximum size of the PSK extension is 2^16^ - 1 octets, an
Imported Identity that exceeds this size is likely to cause a decoding
error. Therefore, the PSK importer interface [SHOULD]{.bcp14} reject any
ImportedIdentity that exceeds this size.[¶](#section-5.1-10){.pilcrow}

The hash function used for HMAC-based Key Derivation Function (HKDF)
\[[RFC5869](#RFC5869){.xref}\] is that which is associated with the
EPSK. It is not the hash function associated with
ImportedIdentity.target_kdf. If the EPSK does not have such an
associated hash function, SHA-256 \[[SHA2](#SHA2){.xref}\]
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} be used. Diversifying EPSK by
ImportedIdentity.target_kdf ensures that an IPSK is only used as input
keying material to one KDF at most, thus satisfying the requirements in
\[[RFC8446](#RFC8446){.xref}\]. See [Section
8](#security-considerations){.xref} for more
details.[¶](#section-5.1-11){.pilcrow}

Endpoints [SHOULD]{.bcp14} generate a compatible `ipskx` for each target
ciphersuite they offer. For example, importing a key for
TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 and TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 would yield two PSKs:
one for HKDF-SHA256 and another for HKDF-SHA384. In contrast, if
TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 and TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256 are supported,
only one derived key is necessary. Each ciphersuite uniquely identifies
the target KDF. Future specifications that change the way the KDF is
negotiated will need to update this specification to make clear how
target KDFs are determined for the import
process.[¶](#section-5.1-12){.pilcrow}

EPSKs [MAY]{.bcp14} be imported before the start of a connection if the
target KDFs, protocols, and context string(s) are known a priori. EPSKs
[MAY]{.bcp14} also be imported for early data use if they are bound to
the protocol settings and configuration that are required for sending
early data. Minimally, this means that the Application-Layer Protocol
Negotiation (ALPN) value \[[RFC7301](#RFC7301){.xref}\], QUIC transport
parameters (if used for QUIC), and any other relevant parameters that
are negotiated for early data [MUST]{.bcp14} be provisioned alongside
these EPSKs.[¶](#section-5.1-13){.pilcrow}

To prevent confusion between imported and non-imported PSKs, imported
PSKs change the PSK binder key derivation label. In particular, the
standard TLS 1.3 PSK binder key computation is defined as
follows:[¶](#section-5.2-1){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-5.2-2 .alignLeft .art-text .artwork}
               0
               |
               v
     PSK ->  HKDF-Extract = Early Secret
               |
               +-----> Derive-Secret(., "ext binder" | "res binder", "")
               |                     = binder_key
               V

[¶](#section-5.2-2){.pilcrow}
:::

Imported PSKs use the string \"imp binder\" rather than \"ext binder\"
or \"res binder\" when deriving `binder_key`. This means the binder key
is computed as follows:[¶](#section-5.2-3){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-5.2-4 .alignLeft .art-text .artwork}
               0
               |
               v
     PSK ->  HKDF-Extract = Early Secret
               |
               +-----> Derive-Secret(., "ext binder"
               |                      | "res binder"
               |                      | "imp binder", "")
               |                     = binder_key
               V

[¶](#section-5.2-4){.pilcrow}
:::

This new label ensures a client and server will negotiate use of an
external PSK if and only if (a) both endpoints import the PSK or (b)
neither endpoint imports the PSK. As `binder_key` is a leaf key,
changing its computation does not affect any other
key.[¶](#section-5.2-5){.pilcrow}

## [6.](#section-6){.section-number .selfRef} [Deprecating Hash Functions](#name-deprecating-hash-functions){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-deprecating-hash-functions}

If a client or server wishes to deprecate a hash function and no longer
use it for TLS 1.3, it removes the corresponding KDF from the set of
target KDFs used for importing keys. This does not affect the KDF
operation used to derive imported PSKs.[¶](#section-6-1){.pilcrow}

## [7.](#section-7){.section-number .selfRef} [Incremental Deployment](#name-incremental-deployment){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-incremental-deployment}

In deployments that already have PSKs provisioned and in use with TLS
1.2, attempting to incrementally deploy the importer mechanism would
result in concurrent use of the already-provisioned PSK directly as both
a TLS 1.2 PSK and an EPSK, which, in turn, could mean that the same KDF
and key would be used in two different protocol contexts. This is not a
recommended configuration; see [Section
8](#security-considerations){.xref} for more details. However, the
benefits of using TLS 1.3 and PSK importers may prove sufficiently
compelling that existing deployments choose to enable this noncompliant
configuration for a brief transition period while new software (using
TLS 1.3 and importers) is deployed. Operators are advised to make any
such transition period as short as possible.[¶](#section-7-1){.pilcrow}

::: {#security-considerations}
::: {#section-8 .section}
## [8.](#section-8){.section-number .selfRef} [Security Considerations](#name-security-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-security-considerations}

The PSK importer security goals can be roughly stated as follows: avoid
PSK reuse across KDFs while properly authenticating endpoints. When
modeled as computational extractors, KDFs assume that input keying
material (IKM) is sampled from some \"source\" probability distribution
and that any two IKM values are chosen independently of each other
\[[Kraw10](#Kraw10){.xref}\]. This source-independence requirement
implies that the same IKM value cannot be used for two different
KDFs.[¶](#section-8-1){.pilcrow}

PSK-based authentication is functionally equivalent to session
resumption in that a connection uses existing key material to
authenticate both endpoints. Following the work of
\[[BAA15](#BAA15){.xref}\], this is a form of compound authentication.
Loosely speaking, compound authentication is the property that an
execution of multiple authentication protocols, wherein at least one is
uncompromised, jointly authenticates all protocols. Therefore,
authenticating with an externally provisioned PSK should ideally
authenticate both the TLS connection and the external provisioning
process. Typically, the external provisioning process produces a PSK and
corresponding context from which the PSK was derived and in which it
should be used. If available, this is used as the
ImportedIdentity.context value. We refer to an external PSK without such
context as \"context-free\".[¶](#section-8-2){.pilcrow}

Thus, in considering the source-independence and compound authentication
requirements, the PSK importer interface described in this document aims
to achieve the following goals:[¶](#section-8-3){.pilcrow}

1.  [Externally provisioned PSKs imported into a TLS connection achieve
    compound authentication of the provisioning process and

There are no known related outputs or security issues caused from the
process for computing imported PSKs from an external PSK and the
processing of existing external PSKs used in (D)TLS 1.2 and below, as
noted in [Section 7](#rollout){.xref}. However, only limited analysis
has been done, which is an additional reason why applications
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} provision separate PSKs for (D)TLS 1.3 and prior
versions, even when the importer interface is used in (D)TLS
1.3.[¶](#section-8-5){.pilcrow}

The PSK importer does not prevent applications from constructing
non-importer PSK identities that collide with imported PSK
identities.[¶](#section-8-6){.pilcrow}

External PSK identities are commonly static by design so that endpoints
may use them to look up keying material. As a result, for some systems
and use cases, this identity may become a persistent tracking
identifier.[¶](#section-9-1){.pilcrow}

Note also that ImportedIdentity.context is visible in cleartext on the
wire as part of the PSK identity. Unless otherwise protected by a
mechanism such as TLS Encrypted ClientHello

## [Appendix A.](#appendix-A){.section-number .selfRef} [Addressing Selfie](#name-addressing-selfie){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-addressing-selfie}

The Selfie attack \[[Selfie](#Selfie){.xref}\] relies on a misuse of the
PSK interface. The PSK interface makes the implicit assumption that each
PSK is known only to one client and one server. If multiple clients or
multiple servers with distinct roles share a PSK, TLS only authenticates
the entire group. A node successfully authenticates its peer as being in
the group whether the peer is another node or itself. Note that this
case can also occur when there are two nodes sharing a PSK without
predetermined roles.[¶](#appendix-A-1){.pilcrow}

Applications that require authenticating finer-grained roles while still
configuring a single shared PSK across all nodes can resolve this
mismatch either by exchanging roles over the TLS connection after the
handshake or by incorporating the roles of both the client and the
server into the IPSK context string. For instance, if an application
identifies each node by the Media Access Control (MAC) address, it could
use the following context string.[¶](#appendix-A-2){.pilcrow}

::: {#appendix-A-3}
``` sourcecode
  struct {
    opaque client_mac<0..2^8-1>;
    opaque server_mac<0..2^8-1>;
  } Context;
```

[¶](#appendix-A-3){.pilcrow}
:::

If an attacker then redirects a ClientHello intended for one node to a
different node, including the node that generated the ClientHello, the
receiver will compute a different context string and the handshake will
not complete.[¶](#appendix-A-4){.pilcrow}

Note that, in this scenario, there is still a single shared PSK across
all nodes, so each node must be trusted not to impersonate another
node\'s role.[¶](#appendix-A-5){.pilcrow}
