# RFC 8943 {#rfcnum}

# Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) Tags for Date {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR), as specified in RFC
7049, is a data format whose design goals include the possibility of
extremely small code size, fairly small message size, and extensibility
without the need for version
negotiation.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

In CBOR, one point of extensibility is the definition of CBOR tags. RFC
7049 defines two tags for time: CBOR tag 0 (date/time string as per RFC
3339) and tag 1 (POSIX \"seconds since the epoch\"). Since then,
additional requirements have become known. This specification defines a
CBOR tag for a date text string (as per RFC 3339) for applications
needing a textual date representation within the Gregorian calendar
without a time. It also defines a CBOR tag for days since the date
1970-01-01 in the Gregorian calendar for applications needing a numeric
date representation without a time. This specification is the reference
document for IANA registration of the CBOR tags
defined.[¶](#section-abstract-2){.pilcrow}

The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR)
\[[RFC7049](#RFC7049){.xref}\] provides for the interchange of
structured data without a requirement for a pre-agreed schema. RFC 7049
defines a basic set of data types, as well as a tagging mechanism that
enables extending the set of data types supported via an IANA
registry.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

This specification defines a CBOR tag for a text string representing a
date without a time. The tagged text string is represented as specified
by the RFC 3339 \[[RFC3339](#RFC3339){.xref}\] `full-date` production.
Per RFC 3339, this represents a date within the Gregorian
calendar.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

This specification also defines a CBOR tag for an integer representing a
date without a time. The tagged integer is an unsigned or negative value
indicating the number of days since the Gregorian calendar date
1970-01-01. As an implementation note, this value has a constant offset
from the Modified Julian Date value (which is defined by the Smithsonian
Astrophysical Observatory as the number of days since November 17,
1858); this value is the Modified Julian Date minus
40587.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

Note that since both tags are for dates without times, times of day,
time zones, and leap seconds are not applicable to these values. These
tags are both for representations of Gregorian calendar
dates.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

::: {#CalendarDates}
::: {#section-1.1 .section}
### [1.1.](#section-1.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Calendar Dates](#name-calendar-dates){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-calendar-dates}

Calendar dates are used for numerous human use cases, such as marking
the dates of significant events. For instance, John Lennon was born on
October 9, 1940 and died on December 8, 1980. One such use case is
driver\'s licenses, which typically include a date of birth. The dates
used in this specification use the Gregorian calendar, as do those in
RFC 3339 \[[RFC3339](#RFC3339){.xref}\]. The time zones and actual times
of these events are intentionally not represented in the calendar
date.[¶](#section-1.1-1){.pilcrow}

The epoch chosen for the second tag, which represents days since the
Gregorian calendar date 1970-01-01, is related to the IEEE Std 1003.1,
2013 Edition \[[POSIX.1](#POSIX.1){.xref}\] time epoch
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z UTC only insofar as both contain the date
1970-01-01. This should not be construed as indicating that dates using
this tag represent either a specific time of day and/or time
zone.[¶](#section-1.1-2){.pilcrow}

The day of the week (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, etc.) is not explicitly
represented in either of these date formats. However, deterministic
algorithms that are beyond the scope of this specification can be used
to derive the day of the week in the Gregorian calendar from dates
represented in both of these formats.[¶](#section-1.1-3){.pilcrow}

### [1.2.](#section-1.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Comparing Dates](#name-comparing-dates){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-comparing-dates}

Comparison of dates in `full-date` format can be accomplished by normal
string comparison, since, by design, the digits representing the date
are in fixed format and ordered from most significant to least
significant. Comparison of numeric dates representing days since
1970-01-01 can be performed by normal integer comparison. Comparison of
dates in other formats or using other calendars require conversions that
are beyond the scope of this specification.[¶](#section-1.2-1){.pilcrow}

Note that different dates may correspond to the same moment in time,
depending upon the time zone in which the date was determined. For
instance, at many times of the day, a conference call occurring on a
particular date in Japan will simultaneously occur on the previous date
in Hawaii; at many times of the day, Japan\'s Friday corresponds with
Hawaii\'s Thursday.[¶](#section-1.2-2){.pilcrow}

Comparing dates with date/time values, which represent a particular
moment in time, is beyond the scope of this specification. That said, if
a date is augmented with a time zone and time of day, a specific
date/time value can be determined, and comparing that date/time value to
others becomes possible. For instance, if one were to augment John
Lennon\'s birth date of October 9, 1940 with the time of day and time
zone of his birth, then it would be possible to derive a date/time at
which he was born that could be compared with other date/time
values.[¶](#section-1.3-1){.pilcrow}

## [3.](#section-3){.section-number .selfRef} [Security Considerations](#name-security-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-security-considerations}

The security considerations of RFC 7049 apply; the tags introduced here
are not expected to raise security considerations beyond
those.[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

A date, of course, has significant security considerations. These
include the exploitation of ambiguities where the date is security
relevant or where the date is used in access control
decisions.[¶](#section-3-2){.pilcrow}

When using a calendar date for decision making (for example, access
control), it needs to be noted that since calendar dates do not
represent a specific point in time, the results of the evaluation can
differ depending upon where the decision is made. For instance, a person
may have reached their 21st birthday in Japan while simultaneously being
a day short of their 21st birthday in Hawaii. Similarly, it would be
inappropriate to use only a date to trigger certificate expiration,
since a date corresponds to a range of times worldwide rather than a
specific point in time that is independent of geographic
location.[¶](#section-3-3){.pilcrow}
