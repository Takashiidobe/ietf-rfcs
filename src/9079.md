Source-specific routing, also known as Source Address Dependent Routing
(SADR), is an extension to traditional next-hop routing where packets
are forwarded according to both their destination address and their
source address. This document describes an extension for source-specific
routing to the Babel routing protocol.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

The Babel routing protocol \[[RFC8966](#RFC8966){.xref}\] is a distance
vector routing protocol for next-hop routing. In next-hop routing, each
node maintains a forwarding table that maps destination prefixes to next
hops. The forwarding decision is a per-packet operation that depends on
the destination address of the packets and on the entries of the
forwarding table. When a packet is about to be routed, its destination
address is compared to the prefixes of the routing table: the entry with
the most specific prefix containing the destination address of the
packet is chosen, and the packet is forwarded to the associated next
hop. Next-hop routing is a simple, well-understood paradigm that works
satisfactorily in a large number of cases.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

The use of next-hop routing limits the flexibility of the routing system
in two ways. First, since the routing decision is local to each router,
a router A can only select a route ABC\...Z if its neighbouring router B
has selected the route BC\...Z. Second, the only criterion used by a
router to choose a route is the destination address: two packets with
the same destination follow the same route. Yet, there are other data in
the IP header that could conceivably be used to guide the routing
decision \-- the Type of Service (ToS) octet and, of course, the source
address.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

Source-specific routing \[[SS-ROUTING](#SS-ROUTING){.xref}\], or Source
Address Dependent Routing (SADR), is a modest extension to next-hop
routing where the forwarding decision depends not only on the
destination address but also on the source address of the packet being
routed, which makes it possible for two packets with the same
destination but different source addresses to be routed following
different paths.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

This document describes a source-specific routing extension for the
Babel routing protocol \[[RFC8966](#RFC8966){.xref}\]. This involves
minor changes to the data structures, which must include a source prefix
in addition to the destination prefix already present, and some changes
to the Update, Route Request, and Seqno Request TLVs, which are extended
with a source prefix. The source prefix is encoded using a mandatory
sub-TLV (\[[RFC8966](#RFC8966){.xref}\], [Section
4.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8966#section-4.4){.relref}).[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

### [1.1.](#section-1.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Application to Multihoming](#name-application-to-multihoming){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-application-to-multihoming}

Multihoming is the practice of connecting a single network to two or
more transit networks. The main application of source-specific routing
is a form of multihoming known as \"multihoming with multiple
addresses\".[¶](#section-1.1-1){.pilcrow}

Classical multihoming consists of assigning a provider-independent range
of addresses to the multihomed network and announcing it to all transit
providers. While classical multihoming works well for large networks,
the cost of obtaining a provider-independent address range and
announcing it globally in the Internet is prohibitive for small
networks. Unfortunately, it is not possible to implement classical
multihoming with ordinary provider-dependent addresses: in a network
connected to two providers A and B, a packet with a source address
allocated by A needs to be routed through the edge router connected to
A. If it is routed through the edge router connected to B, it will most
likely be filtered (dropped), in accordance with
\[[BCP84](#BCP84){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1.1-2){.pilcrow}

In multihoming with multiple addresses, every host in the multihomed
network is assigned multiple addresses, one for each transit provider.
Additional mechanisms are needed in order (i) to choose, for each
packet, a source address that is associated with a provider that is
currently up, and (ii) to route each packet towards the router connected
to the provider associated with its source address. One might argue that
multihoming with multiple addresses splits the difficult problem of
multihoming into two simpler sub-problems.[¶](#section-1.1-3){.pilcrow}

The issue of choosing a suitable source address is a decision local to
the sending host and is an area of active research. The simplest
solution is to use a traditional transport-layer protocol, such as TCP,
and to probe all available source addresses at connection time,
analogously to what is already done with destination addresses, either
sequentially \[[RFC6724](#RFC6724){.xref}\] or in parallel
\[[RFC8305](#RFC8305){.xref}\]. Since the transport-layer protocol is
not aware of the multiple available addresses, flows are interrupted
when the selected provider goes down (from the point of view of the
user, all TCP connections are dropped when the network environment
changes). A better user experience can be provided by making all of the
potential source and destination addresses available to higher-layer
protocols, either at the transport layer \[[RFC8684](#RFC8684){.xref}\]
\[[RFC4960](#RFC4960){.xref}\] or at the application layer
\[[RFC8445](#RFC8445){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1.1-4){.pilcrow}

Source-specific routing solves the problem of routing a packet to the
edge router indicated by its source address. Every edge router announces
into the routing domain a default route specific to the prefix
associated with the provider it is connected to. This route is
propagated all the way to the routers on the access link, which are
therefore able to route every packet to the correct router. Hosts simply
send packets to their default router \-- no host changes are necessary
at the network layer.[¶](#section-1.1-5){.pilcrow}
:::

::: {#section-1.2 .section}
### [1.2.](#section-1.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Other Applications](#name-other-applications){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-other-applications}

In addition to multihoming with multiple addresses, we are aware of two
applications of source-specific routing. Tunnels and VPNs are packet
encapsulation techniques that are commonly used in the Internet to
establish a network-layer topology that is different from the physical
topology. In some deployments, the default route points at the tunnel;
this causes the network stack to attempt to send encapsulated packets
through the tunnel, which causes it to break. Various solutions to this
problem are possible, the most common of which is to point a host route
at the tunnel endpoint.[¶](#section-1.2-1){.pilcrow}

When source-specific routing is available, it becomes possible to
announce through the tunnel a default route that is specific to the
prefix served by the tunnel. Since the encapsulated packets have a
source address that is not within that prefix, they are not routed
through the tunnel.[¶](#section-1.2-2){.pilcrow}

The third application of source-specific routing is controlled anycast.
Anycast is a technique in which a single destination address is used to
represent multiple network endpoints, collectively called an \"anycast
group\". A packet destined to the anycast group is routed to an
arbitrary member of the group, typically the one that is nearest
according to the routing protocol.[¶](#section-1.2-3){.pilcrow}

In many applications of anycast, such as DNS root servers, the
nondeterminism of anycast is acceptable; some applications, however,
require finer control. For example, in some Content Distribution
Networks (CDNs), every endpoint is expected to handle a well-defined
subset of the client population. With source-specific routing, it is
possible for each member of the anycast group to announce a route
specific to its client population, a technique that is both simpler and
more robust than manually tweaking the routing protocol\'s metric
(\"prepending\" in BGP).[¶](#section-1.2-4){.pilcrow}

### [1.3.](#section-1.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Specificity of Prefix Pairs](#name-specificity-of-prefix-pairs){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-specificity-of-prefix-pairs}

In ordinary next-hop routing, when multiple routing table entries match
the destination of a packet, the \"longest prefix rule\" mandates that
the most specific entry applies. The reason why this rule makes sense is
that the set of prefixes has the following \"tree
property\":[¶](#section-1.3-1){.pilcrow}

-   [For any prefixes P and P\', either P and P\' are disjoint, or one
    is more specific than the
    other.[¶](#section-1.3-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-1.3-2.1}

It would be a natural proposition to order pairs of prefixes pointwise:
to define that (D,S) is more specific than (D\',S\') when D is more
specific than D and S is more specific than S\'. Unfortunately, the set
of pairs of prefixes with the pointwise ordering doesn\'t satisfy the
tree property. Indeed, consider the following two
pairs:[¶](#section-1.3-3){.pilcrow}

(2001:db8:0:1::/64, ::/0) and (::/0,
2001:db8:0:2::/64)[¶](#section-1.3-4){.pilcrow}

These two pairs are not disjoint (a packet with destination
2001:db8:0:1::1 and source 2001:db8:0:2::1 is matched by both), but
neither is more specific than the other. The effect is that there is no
natural, unambiguous way to interpret a routing table such as the
following:[¶](#section-1.3-5){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-1.3-6 .artwork .art-text .alignLeft}
              destination                source     next-hop
        2001:db8:0:1::/64                  ::/0            A
                     ::/0     2001:db8:0:2::/64            B

[¶](#section-1.3-6){.pilcrow}
:::

A finer ordering of pairs of prefixes is required in order to avoid all
ambiguities. There are two natural choices: destination-first ordering,
where (D,S) is more specific than (D\',S\')
when[¶](#section-1.3-7){.pilcrow}

-   [D is strictly more specific than D\',
    or[¶](#section-1.3-8.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-1.3-8.1}
-   [D = D\', and S is more specific than
    S\'[¶](#section-1.3-8.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-1.3-8.2}

and, symmetrically, source-first ordering, in which sources are compared
first and destinations second.[¶](#section-1.3-9){.pilcrow}

Expedient as it would be to leave the choice to the implementation, this
is not possible: all routers in a routing domain must use the same
ordering lest persistent routing loops occur. Indeed, consider the
following topology:[¶](#section-1.3-10){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-1.3-11 .artwork .art-text .alignLeft}
       A --- B --- C --- D

[¶](#section-1.3-11){.pilcrow}
:::

Suppose that A announces a route for (::/0, 2001:db8:0:2::/64), while D
announces a route for (2001:db8:0:1::/64, ::/0). Suppose further that B
uses destination-first ordering while C uses source-first ordering. Then
a packet that matches both routes, say, with destination 2001:db8:0:1::1
and source 2001:db8:0:2::1, would be sent by B towards D and by C
towards A and would therefore loop indefinitely between B and
C.[¶](#section-1.3-12){.pilcrow}

This document mandates ([Section 4](#forwarding){.xref}) that all
routers use destination-first ordering, which is generally believed to
be more useful than source-first ordering. Consider the following
topology, where A is an edge router connected to the Internet and B is
an internal router connected to an access network
N:[¶](#section-1.3-13){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-1.3-14 .artwork .art-text .alignLeft}

       Internet --- A --- B --- N

[¶](#section-1.3-14){.pilcrow}
:::

A announces a source-specific default route with source S (::/0, S),
while B announces a nonspecific route to prefix D. Consider what happens
to a packet with a destination in D and a source in S. With
destination-first ordering, the packet is routed towards the network N,
which is the only way it can possibly reach its destination. With
source-first ordering, on the other hand, the packet is sent towards the
Internet, with no hope of ever reaching its destination in
N.[¶](#section-1.3-15){.pilcrow}

## [5.](#section-5){.section-number .selfRef} [Protocol Operation](#name-protocol-operation){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-protocol-operation}

This extension does not fundamentally change the operation of the Babel
protocol, and we therefore only describe differences between the
original protocol and the extended protocol.[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

In the original protocol, three TLVs carry a destination prefix: Update,
Route Request, and Seqno Request TLVs. This specification extends these
messages so that they may carry a Source Prefix sub-TLV, as described in
[Section 7](#protocol-encoding){.xref}. The sub-TLV is marked as
mandatory so that an unextended implementation will silently ignore the
whole enclosing TLV. A node obeying this specification [MUST
NOT]{.bcp14} send a TLV with a zero-length source prefix; instead, it
sends a TLV with no Source Prefix sub-TLV. Conversely, an extended
implementation [MUST]{.bcp14} interpret an unextended TLV as carrying a
source prefix of zero length. Taken together, these properties ensure
interoperability between the original and extended protocols (see
[Section 6](#compatibility){.xref}).[¶](#section-5-2){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-5.1 .section}
### [5.1.](#section-5.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Protocol Messages](#name-protocol-messages){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-protocol-messages}

This extension allows three TLVs of the original Babel protocol to carry
a source prefix: Update TLVs, Route Request TLVs, and Seqno Request
TLVs.[¶](#section-5.1-1){.pilcrow}

In order to advertise a route with a non-zero length source prefix, a
node sends a source-specific update, i.e., an update with a Source
Prefix sub-TLV. When a node receives a source-specific update (prefix,
source prefix, router-id, seqno, metric) from a neighbour neigh, it
behaves as described in \[[RFC8966](#RFC8966){.xref}\], [Section
3.5.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8966#section-3.5.3){.relref},
except that the entry under consideration is indexed by (prefix, plen,
sprefix, splen, neigh) rather than just (prefix, plen,
neigh).[¶](#section-5.1-2){.pilcrow}

Similarly, when a node needs to send a request of either kind that
applies to a route with a non-zero length source prefix, it sends a
source-specific request, i.e., a request with a Source Prefix sub-TLV.
When a node receives a source-specific request, it behaves as described
in [Section
3.8](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8966#section-3.8){.relref} of
\[[RFC8966](#RFC8966){.xref}\], except that the request applies to the
route table entry carrying the source prefix indicated by the Source
Prefix sub-TLV.[¶](#section-5.1-3){.pilcrow}
:::

::: {#section-5.2 .section}
### [5.2.](#section-5.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Wildcard Messages](#name-wildcard-messages){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-wildcard-messages}

In the original protocol, the address encoding (AE) value 0 is used for
wildcard messages: messages that apply to all routes of any address
family and with any destination prefix. Wildcard messages are allowed in
two places in the protocol: wildcard retractions are used to retract all
of the routes previously advertised by a node on a given interface, and
wildcard route requests are used to request a full dump of the route
table from a given node. Wildcard messages are intended to apply to all
routes, including routes decorated with additional data and AE values to
be defined by future extensions; hence, this specification extends
wildcard operations to apply to all routes, whatever the value of the
source prefix.[¶](#section-5.2-1){.pilcrow}

More precisely, a node receiving an update with the AE field set to 0
and the Metric field set to infinity (a wildcard retraction)
[MUST]{.bcp14} apply the route acquisition procedure described in
[Section
3.5.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8966#section-3.5.3){.relref} of
\[[RFC8966](#RFC8966){.xref}\] to all of the routes that it has learned
from the sending node, whatever the value of the source prefix. A node
[MUST NOT]{.bcp14} send a wildcard retraction with an attached source
prefix, and a node that receives a wildcard retraction with a source
prefix [MUST]{.bcp14} ignore the
retraction.[¶](#section-5.2-2){.pilcrow}

Similarly, a node that receives a route request with the AE field set to
0 (a wildcard route request) [SHOULD]{.bcp14} send a full routing table
dump, including routes with a non-zero length source prefix. A node
[MUST NOT]{.bcp14} send a wildcard request that carries a source prefix,
and a node receiving a wildcard request with a source prefix
[MUST]{.bcp14} ignore the request.[¶](#section-5.2-3){.pilcrow}

## [6.](#section-6){.section-number .selfRef} [Compatibility with the Base Protocol](#name-compatibility-with-the-base){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-compatibility-with-the-base}

The protocol extension defined in this document is, to a great extent,
interoperable with the base protocol defined in
\[[RFC8966](#RFC8966){.xref}\] (and all previously standardised
extensions). More precisely, if non-source-specific routers and
source-specific routers are mixed in a single routing domain, Babel\'s
loop-avoidance properties are preserved, and, in particular, no
persistent routing loops will occur.[¶](#section-6-1){.pilcrow}

However, this extension is encoded using mandatory sub-TLVs, introduced
in \[[RFC8966](#RFC8966){.xref}\], and therefore is not compatible with
the older version of the Babel routing protocol
\[[RFC6126](#RFC6126){.xref}\], which does not support mandatory
sub-TLVs. Consequently, this extension [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be used in a
routing domain in which some routers implement
\[[RFC6126](#RFC6126){.xref}\]; otherwise, persistent routing loops may
occur.[¶](#section-6-2){.pilcrow}

### [6.1.](#section-6.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Starvation and Blackholes](#name-starvation-and-blackholes){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-starvation-and-blackholes}

In general, the discarding of source-specific routes by
non-source-specific routers will cause route starvation. Intuitively,
unless there are enough non-source-specific routes in the network,
non-source-specific routers will suffer starvation and discard packets
for destinations that are only announced by source-specific
routers.[¶](#section-6.1-1){.pilcrow}

In the common case where all source-specific routes are originated at
one of a small set of edge routers, a simple yet sufficient condition
for avoiding starvation is to build a connected source-specific backbone
that includes all of the edge routers and announce a non-source-specific
default route towards the backbone.[¶](#section-6.1-2){.pilcrow}

This extension defines a new sub-TLV used to carry a source prefix: the
Source Prefix sub-TLV. It can be used within an Update, Route Request,
or Seqno Request TLV to match a source-specific entry of the route table
in conjunction with the destination prefix natively carried by these
TLVs.[¶](#section-7-1){.pilcrow}

Since a source-specific routing entry is characterised by a single
destination prefix and a single source prefix, a source-specific message
contains exactly one Source Prefix sub-TLV. A node [MUST NOT]{.bcp14}
send more than one Source Prefix sub-TLV in a TLV, and a node receiving
more than one Source Prefix sub-TLV in a single TLV [MUST]{.bcp14}
ignore the TLV. It [MAY]{.bcp14} ignore the whole
packet.[¶](#section-7-2){.pilcrow}

Length

Source Plen
:   The length of the advertised source prefix, in bits. This [MUST
    NOT]{.bcp14} be 0.[¶](#section-7.1-3.6){.pilcrow}
:   

Source Prefix
:   The source prefix being advertised. This field\'s size is (Source
    Plen)/8 octets rounded upwards.[¶](#section-7.1-3.8){.pilcrow}
:   

The length of the body TLV is normally of size 1+(Source Plen)/8 rounded
upwards. If the Length field indicates a length smaller than that, then
the sub-TLV is corrupt, and the whole enclosing TLV must be ignored; if
the Length field indicates a length that is larger, then the extra
octets contained in the sub-TLV [MUST]{.bcp14} be silently
ignored.[¶](#section-7.1-4){.pilcrow}

The contents of the Source Prefix sub-TLV are interpreted according to
the AE of the enclosing TLV. If a TLV with AE equal to 0 contains a
Source Prefix sub-TLV, then the whole enclosing TLV [MUST]{.bcp14} be
ignored. If a TLV contains multiple Source Prefix sub-TLVs, then the
whole TLV [MUST]{.bcp14} be ignored.[¶](#section-7.1-5){.pilcrow}

Note that this sub-TLV is a mandatory sub-TLV. Therefore, as described
in [Section
4.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8966#section-4.4){.relref} of
\[[RFC8966](#RFC8966){.xref}\], the whole TLV [MUST]{.bcp14} be ignored

### [7.2.](#section-7.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Source-Specific Update](#name-source-specific-update){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-source-specific-update}

The source-specific update is an Update TLV with a Source Prefix
sub-TLV. It advertises or retracts source-specific routes in the same
manner as routes with non-source-specific updates (see
\[[RFC8966](#RFC8966){.xref}\]). A wildcard retraction (update with AE
equal to 0) [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} carry a Source Prefix
sub-TLV.[¶](#section-7.2-1){.pilcrow}

Babel uses a stateful compression scheme to reduce the size taken by
destination prefixes in Update TLVs (see [Section
4.5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8966#section-4.5){.relref} of
\[[RFC8966](#RFC8966){.xref}\]). The source prefix defined by this
extension is not compressed. On the other hand, compression is allowed
for the destination prefixes carried by source-specific updates. As
described in [Section
4.5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8966#section-4.5){.relref} of
\[[RFC8966](#RFC8966){.xref}\], unextended implementations will

The extension defined in this document adds a new sub-TLV to three
sub-TLVs already present in the original Babel protocol and does not
change the security properties of the protocol itself. However, the
additional flexibility provided by source-specific routing might
invalidate the assumptions made by some network administrators, which
could conceivably lead to security issues.[¶](#section-9-1){.pilcrow}

For example, a network administrator might be tempted to abuse route
filtering ([Appendix
C](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8966#appendix-C){.relref} of
\[[RFC8966](#RFC8966){.xref}\]) as a security mechanism. Unless the
filtering rules are designed to take source-specific routing into
account, they might be bypassed by a source-specific route, which might
cause traffic to reach a portion of a network that was thought to be
protected. A network administrator might also assume that no route is
more specific than a host route and use a host route in order to direct
traffic for a given destination through a security device (e.g., a
firewall); source-specific routing invalidates this assumption, and, in
some topologies, announcing a source-specific route might conceivably be
used to bypass the security device.[¶](#section-9-2){.pilcrow}
