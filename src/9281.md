The process used by the IETF community for the standardization of
protocols and procedures is described in BCP 9
\[[IETFPROCS](#IETFPROCS){.xref}\]. BCP 9 defines the stages in the
standardization process, the requirements for moving a document between
stages, and the types of documents used during this process. This
document identifies some of the key individual roles and organizations
in that process.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

::: {#terminology}
::: {#section-1.1 .section}
### [1.1.](#section-1.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Terminology](#name-terminology){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-terminology}

This document refers to individual roles in the singular, such as \"a
document editor.\" In reality, many roles are filled by more than one
person at the same time. For clarity, this document does not use phrases
like \"chair (or co-chair).\"[¶](#section-1.1-1){.pilcrow}

This section describes the individual roles involved in the process. It
attempts to list the roles in the order in which they are involved in
the process, without otherwise expressing
significance.[¶](#section-2-1){.pilcrow}

### [2.1.](#section-2.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Document Editor or Author](#name-document-editor-or-author){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-document-editor-or-author}

Most working groups (WGs) focus their efforts on one or more documents
that capture their work results. The WG chair designates one or more
people to serve as the editor(s) for a particular document. The editor
is responsible for ensuring that the contents of the document accurately
reflect the decisions that have been made by the
WG.[¶](#section-2.1-1){.pilcrow}

When a document is composed and edited mainly by one or more
individuals, they may be referred to as \"document authors\". The
distinction is not significant for the standards process. This document
uses the term \"document editor\".[¶](#section-2.1-2){.pilcrow}

When a document editor is a chair of the same WG, another chair should
manage the process around the document. If another chair is not
available, the WG and AD must monitor the process especially carefully
to ensure that the resulting documents accurately reflect the consensus
of the WG and that all processes are followed. This is the collective
obligation of all parties involved in the
document.[¶](#section-2.1-3){.pilcrow}

### [2.2.](#section-2.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Working Group Chair](#name-working-group-chair){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-working-group-chair}

Each WG is headed by a chair who has the responsibility for facilitating
the group\'s activities, presiding over the group\'s meetings, and
ensuring that the commitments of the group with respect to its role in
the Internet standards process are met. In particular, the WG chair is
the formal point of contact between the WG and the Internet Engineering
Steering Group (IESG), via the AD of the area to which the WG
belongs.[¶](#section-2.2-1){.pilcrow}

The details on the selection and responsibilities of a WG chair can be
found in \[[WGPROCS](#WGPROCS){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2.2-2){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-2.3 .section}
### [2.3.](#section-2.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Area Director](#name-area-director){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-area-director}

Each WG is assigned a single responsible area director (AD). The AD can
assist the WG chair in assessing consensus and executing process. The AD
also reviews documents after the WG has approved them, and when
satisfied, the AD coordinates the IESG review and IETF Last Call of the
document.[¶](#section-2.3-1){.pilcrow}

An AD can also sponsor an Internet-Draft directly, but this is not very
common. When this is done, a WG is not
involved.[¶](#section-2.3-2){.pilcrow}

Except for the General Area, IETF areas traditionally have multiple
ADs.[¶](#section-2.3-3){.pilcrow}

### [3.1.](#section-3.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)](#name-internet-engineering-task-f){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-internet-engineering-task-f}

The IETF is an open international community of network designers,
operators, implementors, researchers, and other interested parties who
are concerned with the evolution of the Internet architecture and the
smooth operation of the Internet. It is the principal body engaged in
the development of new Internet Standard specifications and related
documents.[¶](#section-3.1-1){.pilcrow}

### [3.2.](#section-3.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Working Groups (WGs)](#name-working-groups-wgs){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-working-groups-wgs}

The technical work of the IETF is done in its WGs, which are organized
by topics into several [areas](https://www.ietf.org/topics/areas/), each
under the coordination of an AD. WGs typically have a narrow focus and a
lifetime bounded by completion of specific tasks as defined in their
charter and milestones. Some WGs are long-lived and intended to conduct
ongoing maintenance on IETF protocol(s). There are also \"dispatch\" WGs
that assess where new work in the IETF should be done but do not
directly produce standards.[¶](#section-3.2-1){.pilcrow}

For all purposes relevant to the Internet Standards development process,
membership in the IETF and its WGs is defined to be established solely
and entirely by individuals who participate in IETF and WG activities.
These individuals do not formally represent any organizations they may
be affiliated with, although affiliations are often used for
identification.[¶](#section-3.2-2){.pilcrow}

Anyone with the time and interest to do so is entitled and urged to
participate actively in one or more WGs and to attend IETF meetings,
which are usually held three times a year
\[[MEETINGS](#RFC8719){.xref}\]. A WG may also schedule interim meetings
(virtual, in-person, or hybrid). These are scheduled and announced to
the entire WG. Active WG participation is possible without attending any
in-person meetings.[¶](#section-3.2-3){.pilcrow}

Participants in the IETF and its WGs must disclose any relevant current
or pending intellectual property rights that are reasonably and
personally known to the participant if they participate in discussions
about a specific technology. The full intellectual property policy is
defined in \[[IPRRIGHTS1](#IPRRIGHTS1){.xref}\] and
\[[IPRRIGHTS2](#IPRRIGHTS2){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3.2-4){.pilcrow}

New WGs are established by the IESG and almost always have a specific
and explicit charter. The charter can be modified as the WG progresses.
The guidelines and procedures for the formation and operation of WGs are
described in detail in
\[[WGPROCS](#WGPROCS){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3.2-5){.pilcrow}

A WG is managed by a WG chair, as described in [Section
2.2](#wgchair){.xref}. Documents produced by the group have an editor,
as described in [Section 2.1](#doceditor){.xref}. Further details of WG
operation can be found in
\[[WGPROCS](#WGPROCS){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3.2-6){.pilcrow}

WGs ideally display a spirit of cooperation as well as a high degree of
technical maturity; IETF participants recognize that the greatest
benefit for all members of the Internet community results from
cooperative development of technically excellent protocols and
services.[¶](#section-3.2-7){.pilcrow}

### [3.3.](#section-3.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG)](#name-internet-engineering-steeri){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-internet-engineering-steeri}

The IESG is responsible for the management of the IETF technical
activities. It administers the Internet Standards process according to
the rules and procedures defined in \[[IETFPROCS](#IETFPROCS){.xref}\].
The IESG is responsible for the actions associated with the progression
of documents along the IETF Stream, including the initial approval of
new WGs, any subsequent rechartering, and the final approval of
documents. The IESG is composed of the ADs and the IETF Chair. The IETF
Chair also chairs the IESG and is the AD for the General Area. The Chair
of the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) is an ex officio member of the
IESG. Various other bodies have liaisons with the IESG; the full list
can be found at
\<<https://www.ietf.org/about/groups/iesg/members/>\>.[¶](#section-3.3-1){.pilcrow}

All members of the IESG are nominated by a Nominations Committee
(colloquially, \"NomCom\") and are confirmed by the IAB. See
\[[NOMCOM](#NOMCOM){.xref}\] for a detailed description of the NomCom
procedures. Other matters concerning the organization and operation of
the NomCom are described in the IESG Charter
\[[IESG](#RFC3710){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3.3-2){.pilcrow}

### [3.4.](#section-3.4){.section-number .selfRef} [Internet Architecture Board (IAB)](#name-internet-architecture-board){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-internet-architecture-board}

The IAB provides oversight of the architecture of the Internet and its
protocols. The IAB approves IESG candidates put forward by the NomCom.
It also reviews all proposed IETF WG
charters.[¶](#section-3.4-1){.pilcrow}

The IAB provides oversight of the standards process and serves as an
appeal board for related complaints about improper execution
\[[IETFPROCS](#IETFPROCS){.xref}\]. In general, it acts as a source of
advice about technical, architectural, procedural, and policy matters
pertaining to the Internet and its enabling
technologies.[¶](#section-3.4-2){.pilcrow}

The members of the IAB are nominated by the NomCom and are confirmed by
the Board of the Internet Society (ISOC). The IETF Chair is also a
member of the IAB, and the Chair of the Internet Research Task Force
(IRTF) is an ex officio member. Other matters concerning the IAB\'s
organization and operation are described in the IAB Charter
\[[IAB](#IAB){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3.4-3){.pilcrow}

### [3.5.](#section-3.5){.section-number .selfRef} [RFC Production Center (RPC)](#name-rfc-production-center-rpc){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-rfc-production-center-rpc}

Editorial preparation and publication of RFCs are handled by the RFC
Production Center (RPC). RFC policy is defined by the RFC Series Working
Group (RSWG), an open group (similar to IETF WGs), and approved by the
RFC Series Advisory Board (RSAB), which has appointed members. The RFC
Series Consulting Editor (RSCE) is a position funded by the IETF
Administration LLC, with responsibilities defined in
\[[RFCEDMODEL](#RFC9280){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3.5-1){.pilcrow}

Full details on the roles and responsibilities of the RPC are specified
in \[[RFCEDMODEL](#RFC9280){.xref}\], in particular Section

### [3.6.](#section-3.6){.section-number .selfRef} [Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)](#name-internet-assigned-numbers-a){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-internet-assigned-numbers-a}

Many protocol specifications include parameters that must be uniquely
assigned. Examples of this include port numbers, option identifiers
within a protocol, and so on. The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
(IANA) is responsible for assigning values to these protocol parameters
and maintaining parameter registries online
(<https://www.iana.org/protocols>). Assignments are coordinated by
writing an \"IANA Considerations\" section for a given document, as
described in \[[IANADOCS](#IANADOCS){.xref}\]. The IETF\'s relationship
with IANA is defined by formal agreements, including
\[[IANAMOU](#RFC2860){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3.6-1){.pilcrow}

IANA is also responsible for operating and maintaining [several aspects
of the DNS](https://www.iana.org/domains) and [coordinating of IP
address
assignments](https://www.iana.org/numbers).[¶](#section-3.6-2){.pilcrow}

### [3.7.](#section-3.7){.section-number .selfRef} [Internet Research Task Force (IRTF)](#name-internet-research-task-forc){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-internet-research-task-forc}

The IRTF focuses on longer-term research issues related to the Internet
as a parallel organization to the IETF, which focuses on the
shorter-term issues of engineering, operations, and specification of
standards.[¶](#section-3.7-1){.pilcrow}

The IRTF consists of a number of research groups (RGs) chartered to
research various aspects related to the broader Internet. The products
of these RGs are typically research results that are often published in
scholarly conferences and journals, but they can also be published as
RFCs on the IRTF Stream. RGs also sometimes develop experimental
protocols or technologies, some of which may be suitable for possible
standardization in IETF. Similarly, IETF WGs sometimes ask RGs for
advice or other input. However, contributions from RGs generally carry
no more weight in the IETF than other community input and go through the
same standards-setting process as any other
proposal.[¶](#section-3.7-2){.pilcrow}

The IRTF is managed by the IRTF Chair in consultation with the Internet
Research Steering Group (IRSG). The IRSG membership includes the IRTF
Chair, the chairs of the various RGs, and possibly other individuals
(\"members at large\") from the community. Details of the organization
and operation of the IRTF, the ISRG, and its RGs may be found in
\[[IRTF](#RFC2014){.xref}\], \[[IABIRTF](#RFC4440){.xref}\],
\[[IRTFPRIMER](#RFC7418){.xref}\], and

The IETF Trust is the legal owner of intellectual property for the IETF,
IRTF, and IAB. This includes their trademarks, the copyrights to RFCs
and to works of the IETF such as the IETF website, and copyright
licenses for IETF contributions including Internet-Drafts. The
principles for the copyright licenses granted to and from the Trust are
described in \[[IPRRIGHTS1](#IPRRIGHTS1){.xref}\] and
\[[COPYRIGHT](#RFC8721){.xref}\], and the licenses themselves are in the
[Trust Legal
Provisions](https://trustee.ietf.org/documents/trust-legal-provisions/).[¶](#section-3.8-1){.pilcrow}

The Trust also currently owns IANA\'s domain names and trademarks
through an agreement with IANA.[¶](#section-3.8-2){.pilcrow}

The Trustees that govern the Trust are selected from the IETF community,
as described in \[[TRUSTEES](#RFC8714){.xref}\] and the rationale given
in \[[TRUSTRAT](#RFC8715){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3.8-3){.pilcrow}

### [3.9.](#section-3.9){.section-number .selfRef} [IETF Administration LLC (IETF LLC)](#name-ietf-administration-llc-iet){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-ietf-administration-llc-iet}

The IETF Administration Limited Liability Company (colloquially, the
\"IETF LLC\") provides the corporate legal home for the IETF, the IAB,
and the IRTF.[¶](#section-3.9-1){.pilcrow}

The IETF LLC is responsible for supporting the ongoing operations of the
IETF, managing its finances and budget, and raising money. It regularly
reports to the community. The IETF LLC is the legal entity that signs
contracts for the IETF Secretariat, meeting hotels, tools development
contractors, among many others. The IETF LLC also responds to legal
requests; these are often subpoenas in patent
lawsuits.[¶](#section-3.9-2){.pilcrow}

Selection of the IETF LLC Board of Directors is defined in
\[[NOMCOM](#NOMCOM){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3.9-3){.pilcrow}

The IETF Executive Director handles the IETF\'s daily tasks and
management and is overseen by the IETF LLC Board of
Directors.[¶](#section-3.9-4){.pilcrow}

[Section 6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8712#section-6){.relref}
of \[[ISOCIETF](#RFC8712){.xref}\] describes the legal relationship

### [3.10.](#section-3.10){.section-number .selfRef} [IETF Secretariat](#name-ietf-secretariat){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-ietf-secretariat}

The administrative functions necessary to support the activities of the
IETF and its various related boards and organizations are performed by a
Secretariat contracted by the IETF LLC. The IETF Secretariat handles
much of the logistics of running the in-person meetings and is
responsible for maintaining the formal public record of the Internet
standards process

ISOC plays an important role in the standards process. In addition to
being the legal entity that hosts the IETF LLC, ISOC appoints the NomCom
Chair, confirms IAB candidates selected by the NomCom, and acts as the
final authority in the appeals process. This is described in
\[[ISOCIETF](#RFC8712){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3.11-1){.pilcrow}

The way in which the ISOC leadership is selected and other matters
concerning the operation of the Internet Society are described in
