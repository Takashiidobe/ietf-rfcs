RFC 7274 \[[RFC7274](#RFC7274){.xref}\] made some changes to the
terminology used for MPLS Special-Purpose Labels but did not define
consistent terminology.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

One thing that RFC 7274 did was to deprecate the use of the term
\"reserved labels\" when describing a range of labels allocated from a
registry maintained by IANA. The term \"Reserved\" in such a registry
means \"set aside, not to be used\", but that range of labels was
available for allocation according to the policies set out in that
registry. The name \"Special-Purpose Labels\" was introduced in RFC 7274
in place of the previous term, and the abbreviation \"SPL\" was
recommended.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

At the time of writing the first draft version of this document, the
IETF was in the process of allocating the very first SPLs from the
Extended SPL (eSPL) range \[[RFC8595](#RFC8595){.xref}\]. This document
discusses and recommends terminology and abbreviations to be used when
talking about and documenting Special-Purpose
Labels.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

This document updates RFC 3032 \[[RFC3032](#RFC3032){.xref}\] and RFC
7274 \[[RFC7274](#RFC7274){.xref}\] in that it changes the terminology
for both Base SPLs (previously referred to simply as \"Special-Purpose
Labels\") and Extended SPLs.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

This document applies that terminology change to the relevant IANA
registry and also clarifies the use of the Entropy Label Indicator (7)
when immediately preceded by the Extension Label
(15).[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}

Two sets of SPLs are defined for use in MPLS:[¶](#section-2-1){.pilcrow}

-   [The range 0-15 (Base Special-Purpose Labels (bSPLs) as described in
    this document) is specified in RFC 3032
    \[[RFC3032](#RFC3032){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-2-2.1}

-   ::: {#section-2-2.2}
    The range 0-1048575 of eSPLs is specified in RFC 7274
    \[[RFC7274](#RFC7274){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2-2.2.1){.pilcrow}

    -   [The values 0-15 have been reserved and are never to be
        allocated.[¶](#section-2-2.2.2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-2-2.2.2.1}
    -   [The values 16-239 are available for
        allocation.[¶](#section-2-2.2.2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-2-2.2.2.2}
    -   [The values 240-255 are for experimental
        use.[¶](#section-2-2.2.2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-2-2.2.2.3}
    -   [The values 256-1048575 are currently not available for
        allocation. A Standards Track RFC would be needed to change this
        rule, and that RFC would need to define the ranges that are made
        available for allocation and the registration policy for those
        ranges.[¶](#section-2-2.2.2.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-2-2.2.2.4}

Note that IANA maintains a registry that is called \"Special-Purpose
Generalized Label Values\". Labels in that registry have special meaning
when present in certain signaling objects, are 32 bits long, and are not
to be confused with MPLS forwarding-plane labels. This document does not
make any changes to the GMPLS registry or to how labels from that
registry are described.[¶](#section-2.1-1){.pilcrow}

## [3.](#section-3){.section-number .selfRef} [Terminology and Abbreviations](#name-terminology-and-abbreviatio){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-terminology-and-abbreviatio}

Prior to the publication of this document, IANA maintained a name space
for \"Special-Purpose Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label
Values\" code points \[[SPL-NAME-SPACE](#SPL-NAME-SPACE){.xref}\].
Within this name space, there are two registries. One was called the
\"Special-Purpose MPLS Label Values\" registry \[[bSPL](#bSPL){.xref}\].
The other was called the \"Extended Special-Purpose MPLS Label Values\"
registry \[[eSPL](#eSPL){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

The difference in the name of the name space and the first registry is
only that the MPLS abbreviation is expanded. This document makes no
change to the name of the name space itself (i.e., \"Special-Purpose
Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Values\"). This document
changes the name of the first registry to \"Base Special-Purpose MPLS
Label Values\" but leaves the name of the latter registry unchanged as
\"Extended Special-Purpose MPLS Label
Values\".[¶](#section-3-2){.pilcrow}

The following conventions will be used in specifications and when
talking about SPLs.[¶](#section-3-3){.pilcrow}

-   [Collectively, the two (unrelated) ranges (0-15 and 16-1048575) are
    known as \"Special-Purpose Labels\"
    (SPLs).[¶](#section-3-4.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-4.1}
-   [SPLs from the range 0-15 are called \"Base Special-Purpose Labels\"
    (bSPLs).[¶](#section-3-4.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-4.2}
-   [SPLs from the range 16-1048575 are called \"Extended
    Special-Purpose Labels\" (eSPLs). (Note that the reserved values
    0-15 from the \"Extended Special-Purpose MPLS Label Values\"
    registry do not need a name, as they are not available for
    allocation and [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be
    used.)[¶](#section-3-4.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-4.3}
-   [The combination of the Extension Label (XL) (value 15, which is a
    bSPL and is also called the \"xSPL\") and an eSPL is called a
    \"Composite Special-Purpose Label\"
    (cSPL).[¶](#section-3-4.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-4.4}

This results in label stacks such as the examples shown in
Figures [1](#stack-example-1){.xref} and
[2](#stack-example-2){.xref}.[¶](#section-3-5){.pilcrow}

[Section
3.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7274#section-3.1){.relref} of
\[[RFC7274](#RFC7274){.xref}\] contains two paragraphs that describe the
handling of the Entropy Label Indicator (label 7). These paragraphs have
introduced some confusion about whether the Entropy Label Indicator can
be present when immediately preceded by the Extension Label. This
document updates \[[RFC7274](#RFC7274){.xref}\] by replacing those
paragraphs as follows.[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

OLD[¶](#section-4-2){.pilcrow}

> Values 0-15 of the \"Extended Special-Purpose MPLS Label Values\"
> registry are set aside as reserved. Furthermore, values 0-6 and 8-15

>
> Label 7 (when received) retains its meaning as Entropy Label Indicator
> (ELI) whether a regular special-purpose label or an ESPL; this is

NEW[¶](#section-4-4){.pilcrow}

> Values 0-15 of the \"Extended Special-Purpose MPLS Label Values\"
