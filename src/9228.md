# RFC 9228 {#rfcnum}

# Delivered-To Email Header Field {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

The address to which email is delivered might be different than any of
the addresses shown in any of the content header fields that were
created by the email\'s author. For example, the address used by the
email transport service is provided separately, such as through SMTP\'s
\"RCPT TO\" command, and might not match any address in the To: or cc:
fields. In addition, before final delivery, handling can entail a
sequence of submission/delivery events, using a sequence of different
destination addresses that (eventually) lead to the recipient. As well,
a receiving system\'s delivery process can produce local address
transformations.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

It can be helpful for a message to have a common way to record each
delivery in such a sequence, noting each address used in the sequence to
that recipient, such as for (1) analyzing the path a message has taken,
(2) loop detection, or (3) formulating the author\'s address in a reply
message. This document defines a header field for this
information.[¶](#section-abstract-2){.pilcrow}

Email handling information discloses details about the email
infrastructure, as well as about a particular recipient; this can raise
privacy concerns.[¶](#section-abstract-3){.pilcrow}

A header field such as this is not automatically assured of widespread
use. Therefore, this document is being published as an Experimental RFC,
looking for constituency and for operational utility. This document was
produced through the Independent Submission Stream and was not subject
to the IETF\'s approval process.[¶](#section-abstract-4){.pilcrow}

The address to which email is delivered might be different than any of
the addresses shown in any of the content header fields
\[[Mail-Fmt](#RFC5322){.xref}\], such as the To: and cc: fields that
were created by the author\'s Message User Agent (MUA)
\[[Mail-Arch](#RFC5598){.xref}\]. The address used by the Message
Handling Service (MHS) is provided separately, in envelope information,
such as through a \"RCPT TO\" command in
\[[SMTP](#RFC5321){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

As noted in [Section
4.3.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5598#section-4.3.3){.relref} of
\[[Mail-Arch](#RFC5598){.xref}\], \'A transfer of responsibility from
the MHS to a Recipient\'s environment (mailbox) is called
\"delivery\".\' That is, when the destination address is fully and
successfully processed, and any additional processing is by an agent
working on behalf of that address, the message has been delivered.
Rather than placing the message into a recipient inbox or otherwise
completing the handling of the message, that agent might create
additional processing, including to one or more different addresses.
Each transition of responsibility, from the MHS to an agent of a current
addressee, constitutes a distinct delivery. Given handling sequences
that can include aliasing, mailing lists, and the like, the transit of a
message from its author to a final recipient might include a series of
submission/delivery events. Also, the delivery process at a receiving
system can produce local (internal) address
transformations.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

Header fields that provide information about handling can be used when
assessing email traffic issues and when diagnosing specific handling
problems. To this end, it can be helpful for a message to have a common
way to indicate each delivery in the handling sequence and to include
each address that led to the final delivery. This can aid in the
analysis of a message\'s transit handling.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

An additional use can be to aid in detecting a delivery sequence loop,
based on a specific address. With a problematic loop, the same copy of a
message is delivered to the same email address more than once. This is
different from having different copies delivered to the same address,
such as happens when a message is sent directly to an address, as well
as via a mailing list. It is also different from having two copies of
the same message arrive at the same, ultimate destination address,
having been originally posted to two different addresses. Further, this
is different from noting when a message simply transits the same Message
Transfer Agent (MTA) more than once, which might be necessary, such as
when it is processed through a mailing list; an MTA services many
addresses.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

Delivering the same copy of a message more than once, to the same
address, is almost certainly not an intended activity. An example of a
problematic arrangement would be to send a message to mailing list
List-A, where List-A contains an entry for List-B, and List-B contains
an entry for List-A. The message will enter an infinite loop. Loop
detection for email can be a complicated affair. The Delivered-To:
header field provides helpful information, with a definitive indication
that this copy of a message has (already) been delivered to a specific
address.[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}

When specifying new activity that is related to existing activity, there
is a choice of design approach:[¶](#section-1-6){.pilcrow}

-   [Seeking to change (some of) the existing
    behavior[¶](#section-1-7.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-7.1}
-   [Adding to the activity without changing what is already being
    done[¶](#section-1-7.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-7.2}
-   [Calling for separate, new
    activity[¶](#section-1-7.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-7.3}

On the average, attempting to change existing activities is the least
likely to obtain adoption; it can create operational confusion between
old and new activities, which in turn creates resistance to adoption.
Seeking new activity can make sense when that activity is sufficiently
different and deemed sufficiently beneficial. Adding to existing
activity has the selling point of building upon an installed base. The
current specification builds upon an existing installed base of
Delivered-To: activity. It calls for little technical enhancement;
rather, it simply provides for a wider range of
application.[¶](#section-1-8){.pilcrow}

Considerations:[¶](#section-1-9){.pilcrow}

-   [Email handling information, such as this, provides information
    about the email infrastructure, as well as about the recipient.
    Disclosure of this information might engender privacy
    concerns.[¶](#section-1-10.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-10.1}
-   [A specification is not automatically assured of adoption or use.
    Therefore, this document is being published as an Experimental RFC,
    looking for extended constituency and for general operational
    utility.[¶](#section-1-10.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-10.2}
-   [This document was produced through the Independent RFC Stream and
    was not subject to the IETF\'s approval
    process.[¶](#section-1-10.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-10.3}

## [2.](#section-2){.section-number .selfRef} [Background](#name-background){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-background}

Ad hoc use of a Delivered-To: email header field appears to date back to
the 1990s, primarily for loop detection, although documentation is
spotty and system specific. A listing of some implementations is offered
in \[[Prior](#Prior){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2-1){.pilcrow}

It appears that all uses include a string in the form of an email
address, although at least one example has leading text that is a
comment about the address. In some cases, the string appears to be the
email transport destination address, such as the address used in SMTP\'s
\"RCPT TO\" command. In other cases, it appears to be the result of some
internal mapping at the receiving system, although tending to be a
variant of the transport address.[¶](#section-2-2){.pilcrow}

Email loop detection tends to be accomplished through a variety of
different methods, such as counting Received: header fields. These
methods are often combined to greater effect.[¶](#section-2-3){.pilcrow}

The Received: header field\'s \'for\' clause is sometimes useful for
disclosing the recipient\'s address. However, the clause is not used
reliably, and its semantics are not thoroughly defined. Also, it
references an addressing value that is received but might be different
from the value that is ultimately used (as the result of a
transformation). That is, the value in a \'for\' clause might be a
sufficient indicator of delivery addressing, but it might
not.[¶](#section-2-4){.pilcrow}

The Delivered-To: header field annotates an email delivery event. The
header field contains information about the individual address used to
effect that transition.[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

-   [When a message is delivered, as a transition from control by the
    MHS to the recipient\'s store or their agent, a Delivered-To: header
    field [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be added, with the *addr-spec* value
    containing the address that was used by the service to reach the
    recipient.[¶](#section-4-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-4-2.1}
-   [If a receiving system\'s delivery process applies mappings or
    transformations from the address used by the MHS to a local value,
    this new value [SHOULD]{.bcp14} also be recorded into a separate
    Delivered-To: field when transit and processing using that address
    successfully complete. This ensures a detailed record of the
    sequence of handling addresses used for the
    message.[¶](#section-4-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-4-2.2}
-   [As with some other information, each additional Delivered-To:
    header field [MUST]{.bcp14} be placed at the current \'top\' of the
    message\'s set of header fields \-- that is, as the first header
    field, in a fashion similar to the trace fields specified in
    \[[SMTP](#RFC5321){.xref}\] (for example, [Section
    4.1.1.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5321#section-4.1.1.4){.relref}
    of \[[SMTP](#RFC5321){.xref}\]). This produces a sequence of
    Delivered-To: header fields that represent the sequence of
    deliveries, with the first being at the \'bottom\' of the sequence
    and the final one being at the
    top.[¶](#section-4-2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-4-2.3}
-   [As with other fields placed incrementally in this way, with each
    added at the current top, the Delivered-To: header field [MUST
    NOT]{.bcp14} be reordered with respect to other Delivered-To: fields
    and those other fields. This is intended to preserve the fields as
    representing the message handling
    sequence.[¶](#section-4-2.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-4-2.4}

The Delivered-To: header field is added at the time of delivery, when
responsibility for a message transitions from the Message Handling
Service (MHS) to an agent of the specified individual recipient address.
The field can also be added as a result of internal system processing,
to note address transformations.[¶](#section-4-3){.pilcrow}

Note: The presence of an existing Delivered-To: header field, for the
same address, typically indicates a handling loop for this instance of
the message.[¶](#section-4-4.1){.pilcrow}

The syntax of the header field is:[¶](#section-4-5){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-4-6}
``` {.lang-abnf .sourcecode}
"Delivered-To:" FWS addr-spec FWS CRLF ; addr-spec is from [Mail-Fmt]
```

[¶](#section-4-6){.pilcrow}

The field records information about a single address, for one recipient.
See [Section 6](#Security){.xref} for the privacy-related concerns about
divulging addresses.[¶](#section-4-7){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-5 .section}
## [5.](#section-5){.section-number .selfRef} [Multi-Delivery Example](#name-multi-delivery-example){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-multi-delivery-example}

The Delivered-To: header field can be used to document a sequence of
deliveries of a message. Each time an address is fully processed, a
Delivered-To: header field is added, recording a handling sequence, with
the most recent one being towards the \'top\' of the sequence of header
fields.[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

This example demonstrates a message traveling from its original posting,
through a remote group mailing list, on through an independent personal
aliasing mechanism, and then reaching final delivery at yet another
independent email provider.[¶](#section-5-2){.pilcrow}

## [6.](#section-6){.section-number .selfRef} [Security Considerations](#name-security-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-security-considerations}

As with Received: header fields, the presence of a Delivered-To: header
field discloses handling information and, possibly, personal
information.[¶](#section-6-1){.pilcrow}

Security and privacy are essential, if challenging, topics for email in
general and for the handling of metadata in particular. The purpose of
this section is to note points of potential concern, rather than to
provide details for mitigation. The basic mechanism described here has a
long history of use, with no history of being problematic. However, the
expanded use described here might create new scenarios that are
problematic.[¶](#section-6-2){.pilcrow}

An issue specific to this mechanism is disclosure of a sequence of
addresses, applied to the same recipient, if a message goes through a
series of recipient address replacements. This document calls for each
of these addresses to be recorded in a separate Delivered-To: field.
This does not disclose addresses of other recipients, but it does
disclose an address-transformation handling path for the
recipient.[¶](#section-6-3){.pilcrow}

This disclosure is most likely to be a concern when a recipient manually
forwards a message and includes all of the original header fields. This
will expose, to a later recipient, any intermediate addresses used for
getting the original message to the original recipient. Such a
disclosure is likely to be unintended and might be (highly) problematic.
Note that a basic version of this unintended disclosure has long
existed, by virtue of a later recipient\'s seeing Received: header
fields, but especially any with a \'for\' clause. However, a
Delivered-To: header field sequence can disclose significantly more
recipient-specific handling detail.[¶](#section-6-4){.pilcrow}

An issue that is entirely implementation specific \-- and therefore out
of scope for this document \-- is that in some systems, a message that

Even a simple, narrow specification can elicit a remarkable range and
intensity of debate. In spite of the current document\'s being a case of
that challenge, useful discussion has taken place, first in the IETF\'s
emailcore working group mailing list, and then on the long-standing
ietf-smtp mailing list.[¶](#appendix-A-1){.pilcrow}
