# RFC 8686 {#rfcnum}

# Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Cross‑Domain Server Discovery {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to provide
guidance to applications that have to select one or several hosts from a
set of candidates capable of providing a desired resource. ALTO is
realized by a client-server protocol. Before an ALTO client can ask for
guidance, it needs to discover one or more ALTO servers that can provide
suitable guidance.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

In some deployment scenarios, in particular if the information about the
network topology is partitioned and distributed over several ALTO
servers, it may be necessary to discover an ALTO server outside of the
ALTO client\'s own network domain, in order to get appropriate guidance.
This document details applicable scenarios, itemizes requirements, and
specifies a procedure for ALTO cross-domain server
discovery.[¶](#section-abstract-2){.pilcrow}

Technically, the procedure specified in this document takes one
IP address or prefix and a U-NAPTR Service Parameter (typically,
\"ALTO:https\") as parameters. It performs DNS lookups (for NAPTR
resource records in the \"in-addr.arpa.\" or \"ip6.arpa.\" trees) and
returns one or more URIs of information resources related to that IP
address or prefix.[¶](#section-abstract-3){.pilcrow}

The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to provide
guidance to applications that have to select one or several hosts from a
set of candidates capable of providing a desired resource
\[[RFC5693](#RFC5693){.xref}\]. ALTO is realized by an HTTP-based
client-server protocol \[[RFC7285](#RFC7285){.xref}\], which can be used
in various scenarios
\[[RFC7971](#RFC7971){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

The ALTO base protocol document \[[RFC7285](#RFC7285){.xref}\] specifies
the communication between an ALTO client and one ALTO server. In
principle, the client may send any ALTO query. For example, it might ask
for the routing cost between any two IP addresses, or it might request
network and cost maps for the whole network, which might be the
worldwide Internet. It is assumed that the server can answer any query,
possibly with some kind of default value if no exact data is
known.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

No special provisions were made for deployment scenarios with multiple
ALTO servers, with some servers having more accurate information about
some parts of the network topology while others have better information
about other parts of the network (\"partitioned knowledge\"). Various
ALTO use cases have been studied in the context of such scenarios. In
some cases, one cannot assume that a topologically nearby ALTO server
(e.g., a server discovered with the procedure specified in
\[[RFC7286](#RFC7286){.xref}\]) will always provide useful information
to the client. One such scenario is detailed in [Appendix
C](#apx.alto_p2p){.xref}. Several solution approaches, such as
redirecting a client to a server that has more accurate information or
forwarding the request to such a server on behalf of the client, have
been proposed and analyzed (see [Appendix
A](#sec.multiplesources){.xref}), but no solution has been specified so
far.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

[Section 3](#sec.3pdisc-spec){.xref} of this document specifies the
\"ALTO Cross-Domain Server Discovery Procedure\" for client-side usage
in these scenarios. An ALTO client that wants to send an ALTO query
related to a specific IP address or prefix X may call this procedure
with X as a parameter. It will use Domain Name System (DNS) lookups to
find one or more ALTO servers that can provide a competent answer. The
above wording \"related to\" was intentionally kept somewhat unspecific,
as the exact semantics depends on the ALTO service to be used; see
[Section 4](#sec.xdom-usage){.xref}.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

Those who are in control of the \"reverse DNS\" for a given IP address
or prefix (i.e., the corresponding subdomain of \"in-addr.arpa.\" or
\"ip6.arpa.\") \-- typically an Internet Service Provider (ISP), a
corporate IT department, or a university\'s computing center \-- may add
resource records to the DNS that point to one or more relevant ALTO
servers. In many cases, it may be an ALTO server run by that ISP or IT
department, as they naturally have good insight into routing costs from
and to their networks. However, they may also refer to an ALTO server
provided by someone else, e.g., their upstream
ISP.[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}

## [2.](#section-2){.section-number .selfRef} [ALTO Cross-Domain Server Discovery Procedure: Overview](#name-alto-cross-domain-server-di){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-alto-cross-domain-server-di}

This section gives a non-normative overview of the ALTO Cross-Domain
Server Discovery Procedure. The detailed specification will follow in
the next section.[¶](#section-2-1){.pilcrow}

This procedure was inspired by \"Location Information Server (LIS)
Discovery Using IP Addresses and Reverse DNS\"
\[[RFC7216](#RFC7216){.xref}\] and reuses parts of the basic ALTO Server
Discovery Procedure
\[[RFC7286](#RFC7286){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2-2){.pilcrow}

The basic idea is to use the Domain Name System (DNS), more specifically
the \"in-addr.arpa.\" or \"ip6.arpa.\" trees, which are mostly used for
\"reverse mapping\" of IP addresses to host names by means of PTR
resource records. There, URI-enabled Naming Authority Pointer (U-NAPTR)
resource records \[[RFC4848](#RFC4848){.xref}\], which allow the mapping
of domain names to Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs), are installed as
needed. Thereby, it is possible to store a mapping from an IP address or
prefix to one or more ALTO server URIs in the
DNS.[¶](#section-2-3){.pilcrow}

The ALTO Cross-Domain Server Discovery Procedure is called with one
IP address or prefix and a U-NAPTR Service Parameter
\[[RFC4848](#RFC4848){.xref}\] as parameters.[¶](#section-2-4){.pilcrow}

The service parameter is usually set to \"ALTO:https\". However, other
parameter values may be used in some scenarios \-- e.g., \"ALTO:http\"
to search for a server that supports unencrypted transmission for
debugging purposes, or other application protocol or service tags if
applicable.[¶](#section-2-5){.pilcrow}

The procedure performs DNS lookups and returns one or more URIs of
information resources related to said IP address or prefix, usually the
URIs of one or more ALTO Information Resource Directories (IRDs; see
[Section 9](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7285#section-9){.relref}
of \[[RFC7285](#RFC7285){.xref}\]). The U-NAPTR records also provide
preference values, which should be considered if more than one URI is
returned.[¶](#section-2-6){.pilcrow}

The discovery procedure sequentially tries two different lookup
strategies. First, an ALTO-specific U-NAPTR record is searched in the
\"reverse tree\" \-- i.e., in subdomains of \"in-addr.arpa.\" or
\"ip6.arpa.\" corresponding to the given IP address or prefix. If this
lookup does not yield a usable result, the procedure tries further
lookups with truncated domain names, which correspond to shorter prefix
lengths. The goal is to allow deployment scenarios that require
fine-grained discovery on a per-IP basis, as well as large-scale
scenarios where discovery is to be enabled for a large number of IP
addresses with a small number of additional DNS resource
records.[¶](#section-2-7){.pilcrow}

The procedure specified in this document takes two parameters, X and SP,
where X is an IP address or prefix and SP is a U-NAPTR Service
Parameter.[¶](#section-3.1-1){.pilcrow}

The parameter X may be an IPv4 or an IPv6 address or prefix in Classless
Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation (see \[[RFC4632](#RFC4632){.xref}\]
for the IPv4 CIDR notation and \[[RFC4291](#RFC4291){.xref}\] for IPv6).
Consequently, the address type AT is either \"IPv4\" or \"IPv6\". In
both cases, X consists of an IP address A and a prefix length L. From
the definitions of IPv4 and IPv6, it follows that syntactically valid
values for L are 0 \<= L \<= 32 when AT=IPv4 and 0 \<= L \<= 128 when
AT=IPv6. However, not all syntactically valid values of L are actually
supported by this procedure; Step 1 (see below) will check for
unsupported values and report an error if
necessary.[¶](#section-3.1-2){.pilcrow}

For example, for X=198.51.100.0/24, we get AT=IPv4, A=198.51.100.0, and
L=24. Similarly, for X=2001:0DB8::20/128, we get AT=IPv6,
A=2001:0DB8::20, and L=128.[¶](#section-3.1-3){.pilcrow}

In the intended usage scenario, the procedure is normally always called
with the parameter SP set to \"ALTO:https\". However, for general
applicability and in order to support future extensions, the procedure
[MUST]{.bcp14} support being called with any valid U-NAPTR Service
Parameter (see [Section
4.5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4848#section-4.5){.relref} of
\[[RFC4848](#RFC4848){.xref}\] for the syntax of U-NAPTR Service
Parameters and Section
[5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4848#section-5){.relref} of the
same document for information about the IANA
registries).[¶](#section-3.1-4){.pilcrow}

The procedure performs DNS lookups and returns one or more URIs of
information resources related to that IP address or prefix, usually the
URIs of one or more ALTO Information Resource Directories (IRDs; see
[Section 9](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7285#section-9){.relref}
of \[[RFC7285](#RFC7285){.xref}\]). For each URI, the procedure also
returns order and preference values (see [Section
4.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3403#section-4.1){.relref} of
\[[RFC3403](#RFC3403){.xref}\]), which should be considered if more than
one URI is returned.[¶](#section-3.1-5){.pilcrow}

During execution of this procedure, various error conditions may occur
and have to be reported to the caller; see [Section
3.5](#sec.3pdisc-spec-errorhandling){.xref}.[¶](#section-3.1-6){.pilcrow}

For the remainder of the document, we use the following notation for
calling the ALTO Cross-Domain Server Discovery Procedure:
   IRD_URIS_X = XDOMDISC(X,\"ALTO:https\")[¶](#section-3.1-7){.pilcrow}

First, the procedure checks the prefix length L for unsupported values:
If AT=IPv4 (i.e., if A is an IPv4 address) and L \< 8, the procedure
aborts and indicates an \"unsupported prefix length\" error to the
caller. Similarly, if AT=IPv6 and L \< 32, the procedure aborts and
indicates an \"unsupported prefix length\" error to the caller.
Otherwise, the procedure continues.[¶](#section-3.2-1){.pilcrow}

If AT=IPv4, the procedure will then produce a DNS domain name, which
will be referred to as R32. This domain name is constructed according to
the rules specified in [Section
3.5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1035#section-3.5){.relref} of
\[[RFC1035](#RFC1035){.xref}\], and it is rooted in the special domain
\"IN-ADDR.ARPA.\".[¶](#section-3.2-2){.pilcrow}

For example, A=198.51.100.3 yields
R32=\"3.100.51.198.IN-ADDR.ARPA.\".[¶](#section-3.2-3){.pilcrow}

If AT=IPv6, a domain name, which will be called R128, is constructed
according to the rules specified in [Section
2.5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3596#section-2.5){.relref} of
\[[RFC3596](#RFC3596){.xref}\], and the special domain \"IP6.ARPA.\" is
used.[¶](#section-3.2-4){.pilcrow}

For example (note: a line break was added after the second
line),[¶](#section-3.2-5){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-3.2-6}
``` {.sourcecode .lang-pseudocode}
A = 2001:0DB8::20    yields

For this step, an auxiliary function, \"skip\", is defined as follows:
skip(str,n) will skip all characters in the string str, up to and
including the n-th dot, and return the remaining part of str. For
example, skip(\"foo.bar.baz.qux.quux.\",2) will return
\"baz.qux.quux.\".[¶](#section-3.3-1){.pilcrow}

If AT=IPv4, the following additional domain names are generated from the
result of the previous step:[¶](#section-3.3-2){.pilcrow}

-   [R24=skip(R32,1),[¶](#section-3.3-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.3-3.1}

Removing one label from a domain name (i.e., one number of the \"dotted
quad notation\") corresponds to shortening the prefix length by 8
bits.[¶](#section-3.3-4){.pilcrow}

For example,[¶](#section-3.3-5){.pilcrow}

The ALTO Cross-Domain Server Discovery Procedure may fail for several
reasons.[¶](#section-3.5-1){.pilcrow}

If the procedure is called with syntactically invalid parameters or
unsupported parameter values (in particular, the prefix length L; see
[Section 3.2](#sec.3pdisc-spec-step1){.xref}), the procedure aborts, no
URI list will be returned, and the error has to be reported to the
caller.[¶](#section-3.5-2){.pilcrow}

The procedure performs one or more DNS lookups in a well-defined order
(corresponding to descending prefix lengths, see [Section
3.4](#sec.3pdisc-spec-step3){.xref}) until one produces a usable result.
Each of these DNS lookups might fail to produce a usable result, due to
either a normal condition (e.g., a domain name exists, but no
ALTO-specific NAPTR resource records are associated with it), a
permanent error (e.g., nonexistent domain name), or a temporary error
(e.g., timeout). In all three cases, and as long as there are further
domain names that can be looked up, the procedure [SHOULD]{.bcp14}
immediately try to look up the next domain name (from Column 4 in the
table given in [Section 3.4](#sec.3pdisc-spec-step3){.xref}). Only after
all domain names have been tried at least once, the procedure
[MAY]{.bcp14} retry those domain names that had caused temporary lookup
errors.[¶](#section-3.5-3){.pilcrow}

Generally speaking, ALTO provides advisory information for the
optimization of applications (peer-to-peer applications, overlay
networks, etc.), but applications should not rely on the availability of
such information for their basic functionality (see [Section
8.3.4.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7285#section-8.3.4.3){.relref}
of \[[RFC7285](#RFC7285){.xref}\]). Consequently, the speedy detection
of an ALTO server, even though it may give less accurate answers than
other servers, or the quick realization that there is no suitable ALTO
server, is in general preferable to causing long delays by retrying
failed queries. Nevertheless, if DNS queries have failed due to
temporary errors, the ALTO Cross-Domain Server Discovery Procedure
SHOULD inform its caller that DNS queries have failed for that reason
and that retrying the discovery at a later point in time might give more
accurate results.[¶](#section-3.5-4){.pilcrow}

Procedure (as specified in [Section 3](#sec.3pdisc-spec){.xref}) for an
IP address or prefix X and get a list of one or more IRD URIs, including
order and preference values: IRD_URIS_X = XDOMDISC(X,\"ALTO:https\").

IRD_URIS_X = XDOMDISC(X,\"ALTO:https\"). The result, IRD_URIS_X, is a

\[[RFC7285](#RFC7285){.xref}\]) provides information about costs between
individual endpoints and also supports ranking. The ECS allows endpoints
to be denoted by IP addresses or prefixes. The ECS is called with a list
of one or more source IP addresses or prefixes, which we will call (S1,
S2, S3, \...), and a list of one or more destination IP addresses or
prefixes, called (D1, D2, D3, \...).[¶](#section-4.4-1){.pilcrow}

This specification distinguishes several cases, regarding the number of
elements in the list of source and destination addresses,
respectively:[¶](#section-4.4-2){.pilcrow}

1.  ::: {#section-4.4-3.1}
    Exactly one source address S1 and more than one destination
    addresses (D1, D2, D3, \...). In this case, the ALTO client has to
    invoke the ALTO Cross-Domain Server Discovery Procedure (as
    specified in [Section 3](#sec.3pdisc-spec){.xref}) with that single
    source address as a parameter:
    IRD_URIS_S1 = XDOMDISC(S1,\"ALTO:https\"). The result, IRD_URIS_S1,
    is a list of one or more URIs of Information Resource Directories
    (IRDs, see [Section
    9](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7285#section-9){.relref} of
    \[[RFC7285](#RFC7285){.xref}\]). Considering the order and
    preference values, the client has to check these IRDs for a suitable
    Endpoint Cost Service and query it. The ECS is an optional service
    (see [Section
    11.5.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7285#section-11.5.1){.relref}
    of \[[RFC7285](#RFC7285){.xref}\]), and therefore, it may well be
    that an IRD does not refer to an
    ECS.[¶](#section-4.4-3.1.1){.pilcrow}

    Calling the Cross-Domain Server Discovery Procedure only once with
    the single source address as a parameter \-- as opposed to multiple
    calls, e.g., one for each destination address \-- is not only a
    matter of efficiency. In the given scenario, it is advisable to send
    all ECS queries to the same ALTO server. This ensures that the
    results can be compared (e.g., for sorting candidate resource
    providers), even when cost metrics lack a well-defined base unit \--
    e.g., the \"routingcost\" metric.[¶](#section-4.4-3.1.2){.pilcrow}

    the ALTO Cross-Domain Server Discovery Procedure with that single
    destination address as a parameter:
    IRD_URIS_D1 = XDOMDISC(D1,\"ALTO:https\"). The result, IRD_URIS_D1,
    is a list of one or more URIs of IRDs. Considering the order and
    preference values, the client has to check these IRDs for a suitable
    ECS and query it.[¶](#section-4.4-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.4-3.2}

3.  [Exactly one source address S1 and exactly one destination address
    D1. The ALTO client may perform the same steps as in Case 1, as
    specified above. As an alternative, it may also perform the same
    steps as in Case 2, as specified
    above.[¶](#section-4.4-3.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.4-3.3}

4.  [More than one source address (S1, S2, S3, \...) and more than one
    destination address (D1, D2, D3, \...). In this case, the ALTO
    client should split the list of desired queries based on source
    addresses and perform separately for each source address the same
    steps as in Case 1, as specified above. As an alternative, the ALTO
    client may also group the list based on destination addresses and
    perform separately for each destination address the same steps as in
    Case 2, as specified above. However, comparing results between these
    subqueries may be difficult, in particular if the cost metric is a
    relative preference without a well-defined base unit (e.g., the
    \"routingcost\"
    metric).[¶](#section-4.4-3.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.4-3.4}

Considering the four services defined in the ALTO base protocol
specification \[[RFC7285](#RFC7285){.xref}\], the ALTO Cross-Domain
Server Discovery Procedure works best with the Endpoint Property Service
(EPS) and the Endpoint Cost Service (ECS). Both the EPS and the ECS take
one or more IP addresses as a parameter. The previous sections specify
how the parameter for calling the ALTO Cross-Domain Server Discovery
Procedure has to be derived from these IP
addresses.[¶](#section-4.5-1){.pilcrow}

In contrast, the ALTO Cross-Domain Server Discovery Procedure seems less
useful if the goal is to retrieve network and cost maps that cover the
whole network topology. However, the procedure may be useful if a map
centered at a specific IP address is desired (i.e., a map detailing the
vicinity of said IP address or a map giving costs from said IP address
to all potential destinations).[¶](#section-4.5-2){.pilcrow}

The interaction between further ALTO services (and their corresponding
information resources) needs to be investigated and defined once such
further ALTO services are specified in an extension

Resource-consumer-initiated ALTO server discovery (cf. ALTO requirement
AR-32 \[[RFC6708](#RFC6708){.xref}\]) can be seen as a special case of
cross-domain ALTO server discovery. To that end, an ALTO client embedded
in a resource consumer would have to perform the ALTO Cross-Domain
Server Discovery Procedure with its own IP address as a parameter.
However, due to the widespread deployment of Network Address Translators
(NATs), additional protocols and mechanisms such as Session Traversal
Utilities for NAT (STUN) \[[RFC5389](#RFC5389){.xref}\] are usually
needed to detect the client\'s \"public\" IP address before it can be
used as a parameter for the discovery procedure. Note that a different
approach for resource-consumer-initiated ALTO server discovery, which is
based on DHCP, is specified in
\[[RFC7286](#RFC7286){.xref}\].[¶](#section-5.1.1-1){.pilcrow}

The procedure specified in this document can discover ALTO server URIs
for a given IP address or prefix. The intention is that a third party
(e.g., a resource directory) that receives query messages from a
resource consumer can use the source address in these messages to
discover suitable ALTO servers for this specific resource
consumer.[¶](#section-5.1.2-1){.pilcrow}

However, resource consumers (as defined in [Section
2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5693#section-2){.relref} of
\[[RFC5693](#RFC5693){.xref}\]) may reside on hosts with more than one
IP address \-- for example, due to IPv4/v6 dual stack operation and/or
multihoming. IP packets sent with different source addresses may be
subject to different routing policies and path costs. In some deployment
scenarios, it may even be required to ask different sets of ALTO servers
for guidance. Furthermore, source addresses in IP packets may be
modified en route by Network Address Translators
(NATs).[¶](#section-5.1.2-2){.pilcrow}

If a resource consumer queries a resource directory for candidate
resource providers, the locally selected (and possibly
en-route-translated) source address of the query message \-- as observed
by the resource directory \-- will become the basis for the ALTO server
discovery and the subsequent optimization of the resource directory\'s
reply. If, however, the resource consumer then selects different source
addresses to contact returned resource providers, the desired
better-than-random \"ALTO effect\" may not
occur.[¶](#section-5.1.2-3){.pilcrow}

One solution approach for this problem is that a dual-stack or
multihomed resource consumer could always use the same address for
contacting the resource directory and all resource providers, thus
overriding the operating system\'s automatic selection of source IP
addresses. For example, when using the BSD socket API, one could always
bind() the socket to one of the local IP addresses before trying to
connect() to the resource directory or the resource providers,
respectively. Another solution approach is to perform ALTO-influenced
resource provider selection (and source-address selection) locally in
the resource consumer, in addition to, or instead of, performing it in
the resource directory. See [Section 5.1.1](#sec.rcid){.xref} for a
discussion of how to discover ALTO servers for local usage in the
resource consumer.[¶](#section-5.1.2-4){.pilcrow}

Similarly, resource consumers on mobile hosts [SHOULD]{.bcp14} query the
resource directory again after a change of IP address, in order to get a
list of candidate resource providers that is optimized for the new IP
address.[¶](#section-5.1.2-5){.pilcrow}

#### [5.1.3.](#section-5.1.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Interaction with Network Address Translation](#name-interaction-with-network-ad){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-interaction-with-network-ad}

The ALTO Cross-Domain Server Discovery Procedure has been designed to
enable the ALTO-based optimization of applications such as large-scale
overlay networks, that span \-- on the IP layer \-- multiple
administrative domains, possibly the whole Internet. Due to the
widespread usage of Network Address Translators (NATs), it may well be
that nodes of the overlay network (i.e., resource consumers or resource
providers) are located behind a NAT, maybe even behind several cascaded
NATs.[¶](#section-5.1.3-1){.pilcrow}

If a resource directory is located in the public Internet (i.e., not
behind a NAT) and receives a message from a resource consumer behind one
or more NATs, the message\'s source address will be the public IP
address of the outermost NAT in front of the resource consumer. The same
applies if the resource directory is behind a different NAT than the
resource consumer. The resource directory may call the ALTO Cross-Domain
Server Discovery Procedure with the message\'s source address as a
parameter. In effect, not the resource consumer\'s (private) IP address,
but the public IP address of the outermost NAT in front of it, will be
used as a basis for ALTO optimization. This will work fine as long as
the network behind the NAT is not too big (e.g., if the NAT is in a
residential gateway).[¶](#section-5.1.3-2){.pilcrow}

If a resource directory receives a message from a resource consumer and
the message\'s source address is a \"private\" IP address
\[[RFC1918](#RFC1918){.xref}\], this may be a sign that both of them are
behind the same NAT. An invocation of the ALTO Cross-Domain Server
Discovery Procedure with this private address may be problematic, as
this will only yield usable results if a DNS \"split horizon\" and
DNSSEC trust anchors are configured correctly. In this situation, it may
be more advisable to query an ALTO server that has been discovered using
\[[RFC7286](#RFC7286){.xref}\] or any other local configuration. The
interaction between intradomain ALTO for large private domains (e.g.,
behind a \"carrier-grade NAT\") and cross-domain, Internet-wide
optimization, is beyond the scope of this

The ALTO Cross-Domain Server Discovery Procedure, as specified in
[Section 3](#sec.3pdisc-spec){.xref}, first produces a list of domain
names (Steps 1 and 2) and then looks for relevant NAPTR records
associated with these names, until a useful result can be found (Step
3). The number of candidate domain names on this list is a compromise
between flexibility when installing NAPTR records and avoiding excess
load on the DNS.[¶](#section-5.2.1-1){.pilcrow}

A single invocation of the ALTO Cross-Domain Server Discovery Procedure,
with an IPv6 address as a parameter, may cause up to, but no more than,
six DNS lookups for NAPTR records. For IPv4, the maximum is four
lookups. Should the load on the DNS infrastructure caused by these
lookups become a problem, one solution approach is to populate the DNS
with ALTO-specific NAPTR records. If such records can be found for
individual IP addresses (possibly installed using a wildcarding
mechanism in the name server) or long prefixes, the procedure will
terminate successfully and not perform lookups for shorter prefix
lengths, thus reducing the total number of DNS queries. Another approach
for reducing the load on the DNS infrastructure is to increase the TTL
for caching negative answers.[¶](#section-5.2.1-2){.pilcrow}

On the other hand, the ALTO Cross-Domain Server Discovery Procedure
trying to look up truncated domain names allows for efficient
configuration of large-scale scenarios, where discovery is to be enabled
for a large number of IP addresses with a small number of additional DNS
resource records. Note that it expressly has not been a design goal of
this procedure to give clients a means of understanding the IP prefix
delegation structure. Furthermore, this specification does not assume or
recommend that prefix delegations should preferably occur at those
prefix lengths that are used in Step 2 of this procedure (see [Section
3.3](#sec.3pdisc-spec-step2){.xref}). A network operator that uses, for
example, an IPv4 /18 prefix and wants to install the NAPTR records
efficiently could either install 64 NAPTR records (one for each of the
/24 prefixes contained within the /18 prefix), or they could try to team
up with the owners of the other fragments of the enclosing /16 prefix,
in order to run a common ALTO server to which only one NAPTR would
point.[¶](#section-5.2.1-3){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC2317](#RFC2317){.xref}\], also known as BCP 20, describes a way to
delegate the \"reverse DNS\" (i.e., subdomains of \"in-addr.arpa.\") for
IPv4 address ranges with fewer than 256 addresses (i.e., less than a
whole /24 prefix). The ALTO Cross-Domain Server Discovery Procedure is
compatible with this method.[¶](#section-5.2.2-1){.pilcrow}

In some deployment scenarios \-- e.g., residential Internet access \--
where customers often dynamically receive a single IPv4 address (and/or
a small IPv6 address block) from a pool of addresses, ISPs typically
will not delegate the \"reverse DNS\" to their customers. This practice
makes it impossible for these customers to populate the DNS with NAPTR
resource records that point to an ALTO server of their choice. Yet, the
ISP may publish NAPTR resource records in the \"reverse DNS\" for
individual addresses or larger address pools (i.e., shorter prefix
lengths).[¶](#section-5.2.2-2){.pilcrow}

While ALTO is by no means technologically tied to the Border Gateway
Protocol (BGP), it is anticipated that BGP will be an important source
of information for ALTO and that the operator of the outermost
BGP-enabled router will have a strong incentive to publish a digest of
their routing policies and costs through ALTO. In contrast, an
individual user or an organization that has been assigned only a small
address range (i.e., an IPv4 prefix with a prefix length longer than
/24) will typically connect to the Internet using only a single ISP, and
they might not be interested in publishing their own ALTO information.
Consequently, they might wish to leave the operation of an ALTO server
up to their ISP. This ISP may install NAPTR resource records, which are
needed for the ALTO Cross-Domain Server Discovery Procedure, in the
subdomain of \"in-addr.arpa.\" that corresponds to the whole /24 prefix
(cf. R24 in [Section 3.3](#sec.3pdisc-spec-step2){.xref} of this
document), even if delegations in the style of BCP 20 or no delegations
at all are in use.[¶](#section-5.2.2-3){.pilcrow}

Scenario Description
:   An attacker could compromise the ALTO server discovery procedure or
    the underlying infrastructure in such a way that ALTO clients would
    discover a \"wrong\" ALTO server URI.[¶](#section-6.1-1.2){.pilcrow}

Threat Discussion
:   The Cross-Domain ALTO Server Discovery Procedure relies on a series
    of DNS lookups, in order to produce one or more URIs. If an attacker
    were able to modify or spoof any of the DNS records, the resulting
    URIs could be replaced by forged URIs. This is probably the most
    serious security concern related to ALTO server discovery. The
    discovered \"wrong\" ALTO server might not be able to give guidance
    to a given ALTO client at all, or it might give suboptimal or forged
    information. In the latter case, an attacker could try to use ALTO
    to affect the traffic distribution in the network or the performance
    of applications (see also [Section
    15.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7285#section-15.1){.relref}
    of \[[RFC7285](#RFC7285){.xref}\]). Furthermore, a hostile ALTO
    server could threaten user privacy (see also Case (5a) in [Section
    5.2.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6708#section-5.2.1){.relref}
    of \[[RFC6708](#RFC6708){.xref}\]).[¶](#section-6.1-1.4){.pilcrow}

Protection Strategies and Mechanisms
:   The application of DNS security (DNSSEC)
    \[[RFC4033](#RFC4033){.xref}\] provides a means of detecting and
    averting attacks that rely on modification of the DNS records while
    in transit. All implementations of the Cross-Domain ALTO Server
    Discovery Procedure [MUST]{.bcp14} support DNSSEC or be able to use
    such functionality provided by the underlying operating system.
    Network operators that publish U-NAPTR resource records to be used
    for the Cross-Domain ALTO Server Discovery Procedure
    [SHOULD]{.bcp14} use DNSSEC to protect their subdomains of
    \"in-addr.arpa.\" and/or \"ip6.arpa.\", respectively. Additional
    operational precautions for safely operating the DNS infrastructure
    are required in order to ensure that name servers do not sign forged
    (or otherwise \"wrong\") resource records. Security considerations
    specific to U-NAPTR are described in more detail in
    \[[RFC4848](#RFC4848){.xref}\].[¶](#section-6.1-1.6){.pilcrow}

:   In addition to active protection mechanisms, users and network
    operators can monitor application performance and network traffic
    patterns for poor performance or abnormalities. If it turns out that
    relying on the guidance of a specific ALTO server does not result in
    better-than-random results, the usage of the ALTO server may be
    discontinued (see also [Section
    15.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7285#section-15.2){.relref}
    of \[[RFC7285](#RFC7285){.xref}\]).[¶](#section-6.1-1.8){.pilcrow}

Note

:   The Cross-Domain ALTO Server Discovery Procedure finishes
    successfully when it has discovered one or more URIs. Once an ALTO
    server\'s URI has been discovered and the communication between the
    ALTO client and the ALTO server starts, the security threats and
    protection mechanisms discussed in the ALTO protocol specification
    \[[RFC7285](#RFC7285){.xref}\]
    apply.[¶](#section-6.1-1.10.1){.pilcrow}

    A threat related to the one considered above is the impersonation of
    an ALTO server after its correct URI has been discovered. This
    threat and protection strategies are discussed in [Section
    15.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7285#section-15.1){.relref}
    of \[[RFC7285](#RFC7285){.xref}\]. The ALTO protocol\'s primary
    mechanism for protecting authenticity and integrity (as well as
    confidentiality) is the use of HTTPS-based transport \-- i.e., HTTP
    over TLS \[[RFC2818](#RFC2818){.xref}\]. Typically, when the URI\'s
    host component is a host name, a further DNS lookup is needed to map
    it to an IP address before the communication with the server can
    begin. This last DNS lookup (for A or AAAA resource records) does
    not necessarily have to be protected by DNSSEC, as the server
    identity checks specified in \[[RFC2818](#RFC2818){.xref}\] are able
    to detect DNS spoofing or similar attacks after the connection to
    the (possibly wrong) host has been established. However, this
    validation, which is based on the server certificate, can only
    protect the steps that occur after the server URI has been
    discovered. It cannot detect attacks against the authenticity of the
    U-NAPTR lookups needed for the Cross-Domain ALTO Server Discovery
    Procedure, and therefore, these resource records have to be secured
    using DNSSEC.[¶](#section-6.1-1.10.2){.pilcrow}

## [Appendix A.](#section-appendix.a){.section-number .selfRef} [Solution Approaches for Partitioned ALTO Knowledge](#name-solution-approaches-for-par){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-solution-approaches-for-par}

The ALTO base protocol document \[[RFC7285](#RFC7285){.xref}\] specifies
the communication between an ALTO client and a single ALTO server. It is
implicitly assumed that this server can answer any query, possibly with
some kind of default value if no exact data is known. No special
provisions were made for the case that the ALTO information originates
from multiple sources, which are possibly under the control of different
administrative entities (e.g., different ISPs) or that the overall ALTO
information is partitioned and stored on several ALTO
servers.[¶](#section-appendix.a-1){.pilcrow}

## [A.1.](#section-a.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Classification of Solution Approaches](#name-classification-of-solution-){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-classification-of-solution-}

Various protocol extensions and other solutions have been proposed to
deal with multiple information sources and partitioned knowledge. They
can be classified as follows:[¶](#section-a.1-1){.pilcrow}

1.  ::: {#section-a.1-2.1}
    Ensure that all ALTO servers have the same
    knowledge.[¶](#section-a.1-2.1.1){.pilcrow}

    1.1
    :   Ensure data replication and synchronization within the
        provisioning protocol (cf. \[[RFC5693](#RFC5693){.xref}\],
        Figure 1).[¶](#section-a.1-2.1.2.1){.pilcrow}

    1.2
    :   Use an inter-ALTO-server data replication protocol. Possibly,
        the ALTO protocol itself \-- maybe with some extensions \--
        could be used for that purpose; however, this has not been
        studied in detail so far.[¶](#section-a.1-2.1.2.2){.pilcrow}
    :::

2.  ::: {#section-a.1-2.2}
    Accept that different ALTO servers (possibly operated by different
    organizations, e.g., ISPs) do not have the same
    knowledge.[¶](#section-a.1-2.2.1){.pilcrow}

    2.1
    :   Allow ALTO clients to send arbitrary queries to any ALTO server
        (e.g., the one discovered using \[[RFC7286](#RFC7286){.xref}\]).
        If this server cannot answer the query itself, it will fetch the
        data on behalf of the client, using the ALTO protocol or a
        to-be-defined inter-ALTO-server request forwarding
        protocol.[¶](#section-a.1-2.2.2.1){.pilcrow}

    2.2
    :   Allow ALTO clients to send arbitrary queries to any ALTO server
        (e.g., the one discovered using \[[RFC7286](#RFC7286){.xref}\]).
        If this server cannot answer the query itself, it will redirect
        the client to the \"right\" ALTO server that has the desired
        information, using a small to-be-defined extension of the ALTO
        protocol.[¶](#section-a.1-2.2.2.2){.pilcrow}

    2.3
    :   ALTO clients need to use some kind of \"search engine\" that
        indexes ALTO servers and redirects and/or gives cached
        results.[¶](#section-a.1-2.2.2.3){.pilcrow}

    2.4
    :   ALTO clients need to use a new discovery mechanism to discover
        the ALTO server that has the desired information and contact it
        directly.[¶](#section-a.1-2.2.2.4){.pilcrow}

## [A.2.](#section-a.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Discussion of Solution Approaches](#name-discussion-of-solution-appr){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-discussion-of-solution-appr}

The provisioning or initialization protocol for ALTO servers
(cf. \[[RFC5693](#RFC5693){.xref}\], Figure 1) is currently not
standardized. It was a conscious decision not to include this in the
scope of the IETF ALTO working group. The reason is that there are many
different kinds of information sources. This implementation-specific
protocol will adapt them to the ALTO server, which offers a standardized
protocol to the ALTO clients. However, adding the task of
synchronization between ALTO servers to this protocol (i.e., Approach
1.1) would overload this protocol with a second functionality that
requires standardization for seamless multidomain
operation.[¶](#section-a.2-1){.pilcrow}

For Approaches 1.1 and 1.2, in addition to general technical feasibility
and issues like overhead and caching efficiency, another aspect to
consider is legal liability. Operator \"A\" might prefer not to publish
information about nodes in, or paths between, the networks of operators
\"B\" and \"C\" through A\'s ALTO server, even if A knew that
information. This is not only a question of map size and processing load
on A\'s ALTO server. Operator A could also face legal liability issues
if that information had a bad impact on the traffic engineering between
B\'s and C\'s networks or on their business
models.[¶](#section-a.2-2){.pilcrow}

No specific actions to build a solution based on a \"search engine\"
(Approach 2.3) are currently known, and it is unclear what could be the
incentives to operate such an engine. Therefore, this approach is not
considered in the remainder of this
document.[¶](#section-a.2-3){.pilcrow}

## [A.3.](#section-a.3){.section-number .selfRef} [The Need for Cross-Domain ALTO Server Discovery](#name-the-need-for-cross-domain-a){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-the-need-for-cross-domain-a}

Approaches 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, and 2.2 require more than just the
specification of an ALTO protocol extension or a new protocol that runs
between ALTO servers. A large-scale, maybe Internet-wide, multidomain
deployment would also need mechanisms by which an ALTO server could
discover other ALTO servers, learn which information is available where,
and ideally also who is authorized to publish information related to a
given part of the network. Approach 2.4 needs the same mechanisms,
except that they are used on the client side instead of the server
side.[¶](#section-a.3-1){.pilcrow}

It is sometimes questioned whether there is a need for a solution that
allows clients to ask arbitrary queries, even if the ALTO information is
partitioned and stored on many ALTO servers. The main argument is that
clients are supposed to optimize the traffic from and to themselves, and
that the information needed for that is most likely stored on a
\"nearby\" ALTO server \-- i.e., the one that can be discovered using
\[[RFC7286](#RFC7286){.xref}\]. However, there are scenarios where the
ALTO client is not co-located with an endpoint of the to-be-optimized
data transmission. Instead, the ALTO client is located at a third party
that takes part in the application signaling \-- e.g., a so-called
\"tracker\" in a peer-to-peer application. One such scenario, where it
is advantageous to place the ALTO client not at an endpoint of the user
data transmission, is analyzed in [Appendix
C](#apx.alto_p2p){.xref}.[¶](#section-a.3-2){.pilcrow}

## [A.4.](#section-a.4){.section-number .selfRef} [Our Solution Approach](#name-our-solution-approach){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-our-solution-approach}

Several solution approaches for cross-domain ALTO server discovery have
been evaluated, using the criteria documented in [Appendix
B](#sec.xdom-disc-reqs){.xref}. One of them was to use the ALTO protocol
itself for the exchange of information availability
\[[ALTO4ALTO](#I-D.kiesel-alto-alto4alto){.xref}\]. However, the
drawback of that approach is that a new registration administration
authority would have to be established.[¶](#section-a.4-1){.pilcrow}

This document specifies a DNS-based procedure for cross-domain ALTO
server discovery, which was inspired by \"Location Information Server
(LIS) Discovery Using IP Addresses and Reverse DNS\"
\[[RFC7216](#RFC7216){.xref}\]. The primary goal is that this procedure
can be used on the client side (i.e., Approach 2.4), but together with
new protocols or protocol extensions, it could also be used to implement
the other solution approaches itemized

During the design phase of the overall ALTO solution, two different
server discovery scenarios were identified and documented in the ALTO
requirements document \[[RFC6708](#RFC6708){.xref}\]. The first
scenario, documented in Req. AR-32, can be supported using the discovery
mechanisms specified in \[[RFC7286](#RFC7286){.xref}\]. An alternative
approach, based on IP anycast
\[[ALTO-ANYCAST](#I-D.kiesel-alto-ip-based-srv-disc){.xref}\], has also
been studied. This document, in contrast, tries to address Req.

The cross-domain server discovery mechanism should be designed in such a
way that it works across the public Internet and also in other IP-based
networks. This, in turn, means that such mechanisms cannot rely on
protocols that are not widely deployed across the Internet or protocols
that require special handling within participating networks. An example
is multicast, which is not generally available across the
Internet.[¶](#section-b.3-1){.pilcrow}

The ALTO Cross-Domain Server Discovery Protocol must support gradual
deployment without a network-wide flag day. If the mechanism needs some
kind of well-known \"rendezvous point\", reusing an existing
infrastructure (such as the DNS root servers or the WHOIS database)
should be preferred over establishing a new
one.[¶](#section-b.3-2){.pilcrow}

[Appendix C.1](#apx.alto_p2p_app){.xref}, we introduce a generic model
of such an application and show why ALTO optimization is desirable.
Then, in [Appendix C.2](#apx.alto_p2p_arch){.xref}, we introduce two
architectural options for integrating ALTO into the tracker-based
peer-to-peer application; one option is based on the \"regular\" ALTO
server discovery procedure \[[RFC7286](#RFC7286){.xref}\], and one
relies on the ALTO Cross-Domain Server Discovery Procedure. In [Appendix
C.3](#apx.alto_p2p_eval){.xref}, a simple mathematical model is used to
show that the latter approach is expected to yield significantly better
optimization results. The appendix concludes with [Appendix
C.4](#apx.alto_p2p_example){.xref}, which details an exemplary complete
walk-through of the ALTO Cross-Domain Server Discovery
Procedure.[¶](#section-appendix.c-1){.pilcrow}

The optimization of peer-to-peer (P2P) applications such as BitTorrent
was one of the first use cases that lead to the inception of the IETF
ALTO working group. Further use cases have been identified as well, yet
we will use this scenario to illustrate the operation and usefulness of
the ALTO Cross-Domain Server Discovery
Procedure.[¶](#section-c.1-1){.pilcrow}

For the remainder of this chapter, we consider a generic, tracker-based
peer-to-peer file-sharing application. The goal is the dissemination of
a large file, without using one large server with a correspondingly high
upload bandwidth. The file is split into chunks. So-called \"peers\"
assume the role of both a client and a server. That is, they may request
chunks from other peers, and they may serve the chunks they already
possess to other peers at the same time, thereby contributing their
upload bandwidth. Peers that want to share the same file participate in
a \"swarm\". They use the peer-to-peer protocol to inform each other
about the availability of chunks and request and transfer chunks from
one peer to another. A swarm may consist of a very large number of
peers. Consequently, peers usually maintain logical connections to only
a subset of all peers in the swarm. If a new peer wants to join a swarm,
it first contacts a well-known server, the \"tracker\", which provides a
list of IP addresses of peers in the swarm.[¶](#section-c.1-2){.pilcrow}

A swarm is an overlay network on top of the IP network. Algorithms that
determine the overlay topology and the traffic distribution in the
overlay may consider information about the underlying IP network, such
as topological distance, link bandwidth, (monetary) costs for sending
traffic from one host to another, etc. ALTO is a protocol for retrieving
such information. The goal of such \"topology-aware\" decisions is to
improve performance or Quality of Experience in the application while
reducing the utilization of the underlying network
infrastructure.[¶](#section-c.1-3){.pilcrow}

The ALTO protocol specification \[[RFC7285](#RFC7285){.xref}\] details
how an ALTO client can query an ALTO server for guiding information and
receive the corresponding replies. However, in the considered scenario
of a tracker-based P2P application, there are two fundamentally
different possible locations for where to place the ALTO
client:[¶](#section-c.2-1){.pilcrow}

1.  [ALTO client in the resource consumer
    (\"peer\")[¶](#section-c.2-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-c.2-2.1}
2.  [ALTO client in the resource directory
    (\"tracker\")[¶](#section-c.2-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-c.2-2.2}

In the following, both scenarios are compared in order to explain the
need for ALTO queries on behalf of remote resource
consumers.[¶](#section-c.2-3){.pilcrow}

In the first scenario (see [Figure 2](#fig.rcq){.xref}), the resource
consumer queries the resource directory for the desired resource (F1).
The resource directory returns a list of potential resource providers
without considering ALTO (F2). It is then the duty of the resource
consumer to invoke ALTO (F3/F4), in order to solicit guidance regarding
this list.[¶](#section-c.2-4){.pilcrow}

In the second scenario (see [Figure 4](#fig.3pq){.xref}), the resource
directory has an embedded ALTO client. After receiving a query for a
given resource (F1), the resource directory invokes this ALTO client to
evaluate all resource providers it knows (F2/F3). Then it returns a
list, possibly shortened, containing the \"best\" resource providers to
the resource consumer (F4).[¶](#section-c.2-5){.pilcrow}

:::

Note: The message sequences depicted in Figures [2](#fig.rcq){.xref} and
[4](#fig.3pq){.xref} may occur both in the target-aware and the
target-independent query mode (cf. \[[RFC6708](#RFC6708){.xref}\]). In
the target-independent query mode, no message exchange with the ALTO
server might be needed after the tracker query, because the candidate
resource providers could be evaluated using a locally cached \"map\",
which has been retrieved from the ALTO server some time
ago.[¶](#section-c.2-10.1){.pilcrow}
:::
:::

::: {#apx.alto_p2p_eval}
::: {#section-c.3 .section}
## [C.3.](#section-c.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Evaluation](#name-evaluation){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-evaluation}

The problem with the first approach is that while the resource directory
might know thousands of peers taking part in a swarm, the list returned
to the resource consumer is usually shortened for efficiency reasons.
Therefore, the \"best\" (in the sense of ALTO) potential resource
providers might not be contained in that list anymore, even before ALTO
can consider them.[¶](#section-c.3-1){.pilcrow}

For illustration, consider a simple model of a swarm, in which all peers
fall into one of only two categories: assume that there are only
\"good\" (in the sense of ALTO\'s better-than-random peer selection,
based on an arbitrary desired rating criterion) and \"bad\" peers.
Having more different categories makes the math more complex but does
not change anything about the basic outcome of this analysis. Assume
that the swarm has a total number of N peers, out of which there are M
\"good\" and N-M \"bad\" peers, which are all known to the tracker. A
new peer wants to join the swarm and therefore asks the tracker for a
list of peers.[¶](#section-c.3-2){.pilcrow}

If, according to the first approach, the tracker randomly picks n peers
from the N known peers, the result can be described with the
hypergeometric distribution. The probability that the tracker reply
contains exactly k \"good\" peers (and n-k \"bad\" peers)
is:[¶](#section-c.3-3){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-c.3-4 .artwork .art-text .alignLeft}
                / M \   / N - M \
                \ k /   \ n - k /
    P(X=k) =  ---------------------
                      / N \
                      \ n /


            / n \        n!
    with    \ k /  = -----------    and   n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * .. * 1
                      k! (n-k)!

[¶](#section-c.3-4){.pilcrow}
:::

The probability that the reply contains at most k \"good\" peers is:
P(X\<=k) = P(X=0) + P(X=1) + .. + P⁠(X=k).[¶](#section-c.3-5){.pilcrow}

For example, consider a swarm with N=10,000 peers known to the tracker,
out of which M=100 are \"good\" peers. If the tracker randomly selects
n=100 peers, the formula yields for the reply: P⁠(X=0)=36%,
P(X\<=4)=99%. That is, with a probability of approximately 36%, this
list does not contain a single \"good\" peer, and with 99% probability,
there are only four or fewer of the \"good\" peers on the list.
Processing this list with the guiding ALTO information will ensure that
the few favorable peers are ranked to the top of the list; however, the
benefit is rather limited as the number of favorable peers in the list
is just too small.[¶](#section-c.3-6){.pilcrow}

Much better traffic optimization could be achieved if the tracker would
evaluate all known peers using ALTO and return a list of 100 peers
afterwards. This list would then include a significantly higher fraction
of \"good\" peers. (Note that if the tracker returned \"good\" peers
only, there might be a risk that the swarm might disconnect and split
into several disjunct partitions. However, finding the right mix of
ALTO-biased and random peer selection is out of the scope of this
document.)[¶](#section-c.3-7){.pilcrow}

Therefore, from an overall optimization perspective, the second scenario
with the ALTO client embedded in the resource directory is advantageous,
because it is ensured that the addresses of the \"best\" resource
providers are actually delivered to the resource consumer. An
architectural implication of this insight is that the ALTO server
discovery procedures must support ALTO queries on behalf of remote
resource consumers. That is, as the tracker issues ALTO queries on
behalf of the peer that contacted the tracker, the tracker must be able
to discover an ALTO server that can give guidance suitable for that
peer. This task can be solved using the ALTO Cross-Domain Server
Discovery Procedure.[¶](#section-c.3-8){.pilcrow}

[Figure 5](#figure-5){.selfRef}: [Example Network
Topology](#name-example-network-topology){.selfRef}
:::

A new peer of a peer-to-peer application wants to join a specific swarm
(overlay network), in order to access a specific resource. This new peer
will be called \"Resource Consumer X\", in accordance with the
terminology of \[[RFC6708](#RFC6708){.xref}\], and is located in Network
x. It contacts the tracker (\"Resource Directory\"), which is located in
Network t. The mechanism by which the new peer discovers the tracker is
out of the scope of this document. The tracker maintains a list of peers
that take part in the overlay network, and hence it can determine that
Resource Providers A, B, and C are candidate peers for Resource Consumer
X.[¶](#section-c.4-4){.pilcrow}

As shown in the previous section, a tracker-side ALTO optimization
(cf. Figures [3](#fig.tracker_alto_client){.xref} and
[4](#fig.3pq){.xref}) is more efficient than a client-side optimization.
Consequently, the tracker wants to use the ALTO Endpoint Cost Service
(ECS) to learn the routing costs between X and A, X and B, and X and C,
in order to sort A, B, and C by their respective routing costs to
X.[¶](#section-c.4-5){.pilcrow}

In theory, there are many options for how the ALTO Cross-Domain Server
Discovery Procedure could be used. For example, the tracker could do the
following steps:[¶](#section-c.4-6){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-c.4-7}
``` {.sourcecode .lang-pseudocode}
IRD_URIS_A = XDOMDISC(A,"ALTO:https")
COST_X_A   = query the ECS(X,A,routingcost) found in IRD_URIS_A

IRD_URIS_B = XDOMDISC(B,"ALTO:https")
COST_X_B   = query the ECS(X,B,routingcost) found in IRD_URIS_B

IRD_URIS_C = XDOMDISC(C,"ALTO:https")
COST_X_C   = query the ECS(X,C,routingcost) found in IRD_URIS_C
```

[¶](#section-c.4-7){.pilcrow}
:::

In this scenario, the ALTO Cross-Domain Server Discovery Procedure
queries might yield: IRD_URIS_A = ALTO_SRV_A, IRD_URIS_B = ALTO_SRV_B,
and IRD_URIS_C = ALTO_SRV_C. That is, each ECS query would be sent to a
different ALTO server. The problem with this approach is that we are not
necessarily able to compare COST_X\_A, COST_X\_B, and COST_X\_C with
each other. The specification of the routingcost metric mandates that
\"A lower value indicates a higher preference\", but \"an ISP may
internally compute routing cost using any method that it chooses\" (see
[Section
6.1.1.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7285#section-6.1.1.1){.relref}
of \[[RFC7285](#RFC7285){.xref}\]). Thus, COST_X\_A could be 10
(milliseconds round-trip time), while COST_X\_B could be 200 (kilometers
great circle distance between the approximate geographic locations of
the hosts) and COST_X\_C could be 3 (router hops, corresponding to a
decrease of the TTL field in the IP header). Each of these metrics
fulfills the \"lower value is more preferable\" requirement on its own,
but they obviously cannot be compared with each other. Even if there
were a reasonable formula to compare, for example, kilometers with
milliseconds, we could not use it, as the units of measurement (or any
other information about the computation method for the routingcost) are
not sent along with the value in the ECS
reply.[¶](#section-c.4-8){.pilcrow}

To avoid this problem, the tracker tries to send all ECS queries to the
same ALTO server. As specified in [Section 4.4](#sec.ecs){.xref} of this
document, Case 2, it uses the IP address of Resource Consumer x as a
parameter of the discovery procedure:[¶](#section-c.4-9){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-c.4-10}
``` {.sourcecode .lang-pseudocode}
IRD_URIS_X = XDOMDISC(X,"ALTO:https")
COST_X_A   = query the ECS(X,A,routingcost) found in IRD_URIS_X
COST_X_B   = query the ECS(X,B,routingcost) found in IRD_URIS_X
COST_X_C   = query the ECS(X,C,routingcost) found in IRD_URIS_X
```

[¶](#section-c.4-10){.pilcrow}
:::

This strategy ensures that COST_X\_A, COST_X\_B, and COST_X\_C can be
compared with each other.[¶](#section-c.4-11){.pilcrow}

[¶](#section-c.4-12){.pilcrow}

As discussed above, the tracker calls the ALTO Cross-Domain Server
Discovery Procedure with IP address X as a parameter. For the remainder
of this example, we assume that X = 2001:DB8:1:2:227:eff:fe6a:de42.
Thus, the procedure call is IRD_URIS_X =
XDOMDISC(2001:DB8:1:2:227:eff:fe6a:de42,\"ALTO:https\").[¶](#section-c.4-13){.pilcrow}

The first parameter, 2001:DB8:1:2:227:eff:fe6a:de42, is a single IPv6
address. Thus, we get AT = IPv6, A = 2001:DB8:1:2:227:eff:fe6a:de42, L =
128, and SP = \"ALTO:https\".[¶](#section-c.4-14){.pilcrow}

In order to illustrate the third step of the ALTO Cross-Domain Server
Discovery Procedure, we use the \"dig\" (domain information groper) DNS
lookup utility that is available for many operating systems (e.g.,
Linux). A real implementation of the ALTO Cross-Domain Server Discovery
Procedure would not be based on the \"dig\" utility but instead would
use appropriate libraries and/or operating-system APIs. Please note that
the following steps have been performed in a controlled lab environment
with an appropriately configured name server. A suitable DNS
configuration will be needed to reproduce these results. Please also
note that the rather verbose output of the \"dig\" tool has been
shortened to the relevant lines.[¶](#section-c.4-19){.pilcrow}

Since AT = IPv6 and L = 128, in the table given in [Section
3.4](#sec.3pdisc-spec-step3){.xref}, the sixth row (not counting the
column headers) applies.[¶](#section-c.4-20){.pilcrow}

As mandated by the third column, we start with a lookup of R128, looking
for NAPTR resource records:[¶](#section-c.4-21){.pilcrow}

The domain name R128 does not exist (status: NXDOMAIN), so we cannot get
a useful result. Therefore, we continue with the fourth column of the

The domain name R64 could be looked up (status: NOERROR), but there are
no NAPTR resource records associated with it (ANSWER: 0). There may be
some other resource records such as PTR, NS, or SOA, but we are not
interested in them. Thus, we do not get a useful result, and we continue
with looking up R56:[¶](#section-c.4-25){.pilcrow}

The domain name R56 could be looked up, and there are NAPTR resource
records associated with it. However, each of these records has a service
parameter that does not match our SP = \"ALTO:https\" (see
\[[RFC7216](#RFC7216){.xref}\] for \"LIS:HELD\"), and therefore we have
to ignore them. Consequently, we still do not have a useful result and
continue with a lookup of R48:[¶](#section-c.4-27){.pilcrow}

This lookup yields two NAPTR resource records. We have to ignore the
second one as its service parameter does not match our SP, but the first
NAPTR resource record has a matching service parameter. Therefore, the
procedure terminates successfully and the final outcome is: IRD_URIS_X =
\"https://alto1.example.net/ird\".[¶](#section-c.4-29){.pilcrow}

The ALTO client that is embedded in the tracker will access the ALTO
Information Resource Directory (IRD, see [Section
9](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7285#section-9){.relref} of
\[[RFC7285](#RFC7285){.xref}\]) at this URI, look for the Endpoint Cost
Service (ECS, see [Section
11.5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7285#section-11.5){.relref} of
\[[RFC7285](#RFC7285){.xref}\]), and query the ECS for the costs between
A and X, B and X, and C and X, before returning an ALTO-optimized list
of candidate resource providers to resource consumer
X.[¶](#section-c.4-30){.pilcrow}
