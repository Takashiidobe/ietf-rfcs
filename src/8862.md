# Best Practices for Securing RTP Media Signaled with SIP {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

Although the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) includes a suite of
security services that has been expanded by numerous specifications over
the years, there is no single place that explains how to use SIP to
establish confidential media sessions. Additionally, existing mechanisms
have some feature gaps that need to be identified and resolved in order
for them to address the pervasive monitoring threat model. This
specification describes best practices for negotiating confidential
media with SIP, including a comprehensive protection solution that binds
the media layer to SIP layer
identities.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

The [Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)](#RFC3261){.xref}
\[[RFC3261](#RFC3261){.xref}\] includes a suite of security services,
including Digest Authentication \[[RFC7616](#RFC7616){.xref}\] for
authenticating entities with a shared secret, TLS
\[[RFC8446](#RFC8446){.xref}\] for transport security, and (optionally)
S/MIME \[[RFC8551](#RFC8551){.xref}\] for body security. SIP is
frequently used to establish media sessions \-- in particular, audio or
audiovisual sessions, which have their own security mechanisms
available, such as [the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol
(SRTP)](#RFC3711){.xref} \[[RFC3711](#RFC3711){.xref}\]. However, the
practices needed to bind security at the media layer to security at the
SIP layer, to provide an assurance that protection is in place all the
way up the stack, rely on a great many external security mechanisms and
practices. This document provides documentation to explain their optimal
use as a best practice.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

Revelations about widespread pervasive monitoring of the Internet have
led to a greater desire to protect Internet communications
\[[RFC7258](#RFC7258){.xref}\]. In order to maximize the use of security
features, especially of media confidentiality, opportunistic measures
serve as a stopgap when a full suite of services cannot be negotiated
all the way up the stack. Opportunistic media security for SIP is
described in \[[RFC8643](#RFC8643){.xref}\], which builds on the prior
efforts of
\[[Best-Effort-SRTP](#I-D.kaplan-mmusic-best-effort-srtp){.xref}\]. With
opportunistic encryption, there is an attempt to negotiate the use of
encryption, but if the negotiation fails, then cleartext is used.
Opportunistic encryption approaches typically have no integrity
protection for the keying material.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

This document contains the SIP Best-practice Recommendations Against
Network Dangers to privacY (SIPBRANDY) profile of Secure Telephone
Identity Revisited (STIR) \[[RFC8224](#RFC8224){.xref}\] for media
confidentiality, providing a comprehensive security solution for SIP
media that includes integrity protection for keying material and offers
application-layer assurance that media confidentiality is in place.
Various specifications that User Agents (UAs) must implement to support
media confidentiality are given in the sections below; a summary of the
best current practices appears in [Section
8](#bcp){.xref}.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

## [3.](#section-3){.section-number .selfRef} [Security at the SIP and SDP Layer](#name-security-at-the-sip-and-sdp){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-security-at-the-sip-and-sdp}

There are two approaches to providing confidentiality for media sessions
set up with SIP: comprehensive protection and opportunistic security (as
defined in \[[RFC7435](#RFC7435){.xref}\]). This document only addresses
comprehensive protection.[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

Comprehensive protection for media sessions established by SIP requires
the interaction of three protocols: the [Session Initiation Protocol
(SIP)](#RFC3261){.xref} \[[RFC3261](#RFC3261){.xref}\], the [Session
Description Protocol (SDP)](#RFC4566){.xref}
\[[RFC4566](#RFC4566){.xref}\], and the [Real-time Transport Protocol
(RTP)](#RFC3550){.xref} \[[RFC3550](#RFC3550){.xref}\] \--
in particular, its secure profile [SRTP](#RFC3711){.xref}
\[[RFC3711](#RFC3711){.xref}\]. Broadly, it is the responsibility of SIP
to provide integrity protection for the media keying attributes conveyed
by SDP, and those attributes will in turn identify the keys used by
endpoints in the RTP media session(s) that SDP
negotiates.[¶](#section-3-2){.pilcrow}

Note that this framework does not apply to keys that also require
confidentiality protection in the signaling layer, such as the SDP
\"k=\" line, which [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be used in conjunction with this
profile.[¶](#section-3-3){.pilcrow}

In that way, once SIP and SDP have exchanged the necessary information
to initiate a session, media endpoints will have a strong assurance that
the keys they exchange have not been tampered with by third parties and
that end-to-end confidentiality is available.[¶](#section-3-4){.pilcrow}

To establish the identity of the endpoints of a SIP session, this
specification uses [STIR](#RFC8224){.xref}
\[[RFC8224](#RFC8224){.xref}\]. The STIR Identity header has been
designed to prevent a class of impersonation attacks that are commonly
used in robocalling, voicemail hacking, and related threats. STIR
generates a signature over certain features of SIP requests, including
header field values that contain an identity for the originator of the
request, such as the From header field or P‑Asserted-Identity field, and
also over the media keys in SDP if they are present. As currently
defined, STIR provides a signature over the \"a=fingerprint\" attribute,
which is a fingerprint of the key used by [DTLS-SRTP](#RFC5763){.xref}
\[[RFC5763](#RFC5763){.xref}\]; consequently, STIR only offers
comprehensive protection for SIP sessions in concert with SDP and SRTP
when DTLS-SRTP is the media security service. The underlying [Personal
Assertion Token (PASSporT) object](#RFC8225){.xref}
\[[RFC8225](#RFC8225){.xref}\] used by STIR is extensible, however, and
it would be possible to provide signatures over other SDP attributes
that contain alternate keying material. A profile for using STIR to
provide media confidentiality is given in [Section
4](#stirprof){.xref}.[¶](#section-3-5){.pilcrow}
:::

::: {#stirprof}
::: {#section-4 .section}
## [4.](#section-4){.section-number .selfRef} [STIR Profile for Endpoint Authentication and Verification Services](#name-stir-profile-for-endpoint-a){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-stir-profile-for-endpoint-a}

[STIR](#RFC8224){.xref} \[[RFC8224](#RFC8224){.xref}\] defines the
Identity header field for SIP, which provides a cryptographic
attestation of the source of communications. This document includes a
profile of STIR, called the SIPBRANDY profile, where the STIR
verification service will act in concert with an SRTP media endpoint to
ensure that the key fingerprints, as given in SDP, match the keys
exchanged to establish DTLS-SRTP. To satisfy this condition, the
verification service function would in this case be implemented in the
SIP User Agent Server (UAS), which would be composed with the media
endpoint. If the STIR authentication service or verification service
functions are implemented at an intermediary rather than an endpoint,
this introduces the possibility that the intermediary could act as a man
in the middle, altering key fingerprints. As this attack is not in
STIR\'s core threat model, which focuses on impersonation rather than
man-in-the-middle attacks, STIR offers no specific protections against
such interference.[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

The SIPBRANDY profile for media confidentiality thus shifts these
responsibilities to the endpoints rather than the intermediaries. While
intermediaries [MAY]{.bcp14} provide the verification service function
of STIR for SIPBRANDY transactions, the verification needs to be
repeated at the endpoint to obtain end-to-end assurance. Intermediaries
supporting this specification [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} block or otherwise
redirect calls if they do not trust the signing credential. The
SIPBRANDY profile is based on an end-to-end trust model, so it is up to
the endpoints to determine if they support signing credentials, not
intermediaries.[¶](#section-4-2){.pilcrow}

In order to be compliant with best practices for SIP media
confidentiality with comprehensive protection, UA implementations
[MUST]{.bcp14} implement both the authentication service and
verification service roles described in \[[RFC8224](#RFC8224){.xref}\].
STIR authentication services [MUST]{.bcp14} signal their compliance with
this specification by including the \"msec\" claim defined in this
specification to the PASSporT payload. Implementations [MUST]{.bcp14}
provide key fingerprints in SDP and the appropriate signatures over them
as specified in
\[[RFC8225](#RFC8225){.xref}\].[¶](#section-4-3){.pilcrow}

When generating either an offer or an answer
\[[RFC3264](#RFC3264){.xref}\], compliant implementations [MUST]{.bcp14}
include an \"a=fingerprint\" attribute containing the fingerprint of an
appropriate key (see [Section
4.1](#stircred){.xref}).[¶](#section-4-4){.pilcrow}

::: {#stircred}
::: {#section-4.1 .section}
### [4.1.](#section-4.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Credentials](#name-credentials){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-credentials}

In order to implement the authentication service function in the UA, SIP
endpoints will need to acquire the credentials needed to sign for their
own identity. That identity is typically carried in the From header
field of a SIP request and contains either a greenfield SIP URI (e.g.,
\"sip:alice\@example.com\") or a telephone number (which can appear in a
variety of ways, e.g., \"sip:+17004561212\@example.com;user=phone\").
[Section 8](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8224#section-8){.relref}
of \[[RFC8224](#RFC8224){.xref}\] contains guidance for separating the
two and determining what sort of credential is needed to sign for
each.[¶](#section-4.1-1){.pilcrow}

To date, few commercial certification authorities (CAs) issue
certificates for SIP URIs or telephone numbers; though work is ongoing
on systems for this purpose (such as
\[[ACME-Auth-Token](#I-D.ietf-acme-authority-token){.xref}\]), it is not
yet mature enough to be recommended as a best practice. This is one
reason why STIR permits intermediaries to act as an authentication
service on behalf of an entire domain, just as in SIP a proxy server can
provide domain-level SIP service. While CAs that offer
proof-of-possession certificates similar to those used for email could
be offered for SIP \-- for either greenfield identifiers or telephone
numbers \-- this specification does not require their
use.[¶](#section-4.1-2){.pilcrow}

For users who do not possess such certificates,
[DTLS-SRTP](#RFC5763){.xref} \[[RFC5763](#RFC5763){.xref}\] permits the
use of self-signed public keys. The profile of STIR in this document,
called the SIPBRANDY profile, employs the more relaxed authority
requirements of \[[RFC8224](#RFC8224){.xref}\] to allow the use of
self-signed public keys for authentication services that are composed
with UAs, by generating a certificate (per the guidance in
\[[RFC8226](#RFC8226){.xref}\]) with a subject corresponding to the
user\'s identity. To obtain comprehensive protection with a self-signed
certificate, some out-of-band verification is needed as well. Such a
credential could be used for trust on first use (see
\[[RFC7435](#RFC7435){.xref}\]) by relying parties. Note that relying
parties [SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} use certificate revocation mechanisms or
real-time certificate verification systems for self-signed certificates,
as they will not increase confidence in the
certificate.[¶](#section-4.1-3){.pilcrow}

Users who wish to remain anonymous can instead generate self-signed
certificates as described in [Section
4.2](#anon){.xref}.[¶](#section-4.1-4){.pilcrow}

Generally speaking, without access to out-of-band information about
which certificates were issued to whom, it will be very difficult for
relying parties to ascertain whether or not the signer of a SIP request
is genuinely an \"endpoint\". Even the term \"endpoint\" is a
problematic one, as SIP UAs can be composed in a variety of
architectures and may not be devices under direct user control. While it
is possible that techniques based on certificate transparency
\[[RFC6962](#RFC6962){.xref}\] or similar practices could help UAs to
recognize one another\'s certificates, those operational systems will
need to ramp up with the CAs that issue credentials to end-user devices
going forward.[¶](#section-4.1-5){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-4.2 .section}
### [4.2.](#section-4.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Anonymous Communications](#name-anonymous-communications){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-anonymous-communications}

In some cases, the identity of the initiator of a SIP session may be
withheld due to user or provider policy. Following the recommendations
of \[[RFC3323](#RFC3323){.xref}\], this may involve using an identity
such as \"anonymous\@anonymous.invalid\" in the identity fields of a SIP
request. \[[RFC8224](#RFC8224){.xref}\] does not currently permit
authentication services to sign for requests that supply this identity.
It does, however, permit signing for valid domains, such as
\"anonymous\@example.com\", as a way of implementing an anonymization
service as specified in
\[[RFC3323](#RFC3323){.xref}\].[¶](#section-4.2-1){.pilcrow}

Even for anonymous sessions, providing media confidentiality and partial
SDP integrity is still desirable. One-time self-signed certificates for
anonymous communications [SHOULD]{.bcp14} include a subjectAltName of
\"sip:anonymous\@anonymous.invalid\". After a session is terminated, the
certificate [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be discarded, and a new one, with fresh
keying material, [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be generated before each future
anonymous call. As with self-signed certificates, relying parties
[SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} use certificate revocation mechanisms or real-time
certificate verification systems for anonymous certificates, as they
will not increase confidence in the
certificate.[¶](#section-4.2-2){.pilcrow}

Note that when using one-time anonymous self-signed certificates, any
man in the middle could strip the Identity header and replace it with
one signed by its own one-time certificate, changing the \"mky\"
parameters of PASSporT and any \"a=fingerprint\" attributes in SDP as it
chooses. This signature only provides protection against
non‑Identity-aware entities that might modify SDP without altering the
PASSporT conveyed in the Identity header.[¶](#section-4.2-3){.pilcrow}

### [4.3.](#section-4.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Connected Identity Usage](#name-connected-identity-usage){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-connected-identity-usage}

[STIR](#RFC8224){.xref} \[[RFC8224](#RFC8224){.xref}\] provides
integrity protection for the fingerprint attributes in SIP request
bodies but not SIP responses. When a session is established, therefore,
any SDP body carried by a 200‑class response in the backwards direction
will not be protected by an authentication service and cannot be
verified. Thus, sending a secured SDP body in the backwards direction
will require an extra RTT, typically a request sent in the backwards
direction.[¶](#section-4.3-1){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC4916](#RFC4916){.xref}\] explored the problem of providing
\"connected identity\" to implementations of
\[[RFC4474](#RFC4474){.xref}\] (which is obsoleted by
\[[RFC8224](#RFC8224){.xref}\]); \[[RFC4916](#RFC4916){.xref}\] uses a
provisional or mid-dialog UPDATE request in the backwards (reverse)
direction to convey an Identity header field for the recipient of an
INVITE. The procedures in \[[RFC4916](#RFC4916){.xref}\] are largely
compatible with the revision of the Identity header in
\[[RFC8224](#RFC8224){.xref}\]. However, the following need to be
considered:[¶](#section-4.3-2){.pilcrow}

-   [The UPDATE carrying signed SDP with a fingerprint in the backwards
    direction needs to be sent during dialog establishment, following
    the receipt of a Provisional Response Acknowledgement (PRACK) after
    a provisional 1xx
    response.[¶](#section-4.3-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.3-3.1}
-   [For use with this SIPBRANDY profile for media confidentiality, the
    UAS that responds to the INVITE request needs to act as an
    authentication service for the UPDATE sent in the backwards
    direction.[¶](#section-4.3-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.3-3.2}
-   [Per the text in [Section
    4.4.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4916#section-4.4.1){.relref}
    of \[[RFC4916](#RFC4916){.xref}\] regarding the receipt at a User
    Agent Client (UAC) of error code 428, 436, 437, or 438 in response
    to a mid-dialog request, it is [RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14} that the dialog
    be treated as terminated. However, [Section
    6.1.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8224#section-6.1.1){.relref}
    of \[[RFC8224](#RFC8224){.xref}\] allows the retransmission of
    requests with repairable error conditions. In particular, an
    authentication service might retry a mid-dialog rather than treating
    the dialog as terminated, although only one such retry is
    permitted.[¶](#section-4.3-3.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.3-3.3}
-   [Note that the examples in \[[RFC4916](#RFC4916){.xref}\] are based
    on \[[RFC4474](#RFC4474){.xref}\] and will not match signatures
    using
    \[[RFC8224](#RFC8224){.xref}\].[¶](#section-4.3-3.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.3-3.4}

Future work may be done to revise \[[RFC4916](#RFC4916){.xref}\] for
STIR; that work should take into account any impacts on the SIPBRANDY
profile described in this document. The use of
\[[RFC4916](#RFC4916){.xref}\] has some further interactions with
Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE)
\[[RFC8445](#RFC8445){.xref}\]; see [Section
7](#ice){.xref}.[¶](#section-4.3-4){.pilcrow}

### [4.4.](#section-4.4){.section-number .selfRef} [Authorization Decisions](#name-authorization-decisions){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-authorization-decisions}

\[[RFC8224](#RFC8224){.xref}\] grants STIR verification services a great
deal of latitude when making authorization decisions based on the
presence of the Identity header field. It is largely a matter of local
policy whether an endpoint rejects a call based on the absence of an
Identity header field, or even the presence of a header that fails an
integrity check against the request.[¶](#section-4.4-1){.pilcrow}

For this SIPBRANDY profile of STIR, however, a compliant verification
service that receives a dialog-forming SIP request containing an
Identity header with a PASSporT type of \"msec\", after validating the
request per the steps described in [Section
6.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8224#section-6.2){.relref} of
\[[RFC8224](#RFC8224){.xref}\], [MUST]{.bcp14} reject the request if
there is any failure in that validation process with the appropriate
status code per [Section
6.2.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8224#section-6.2.2){.relref} of
\[[RFC8224](#RFC8224){.xref}\]. If the request is valid, then if a
terminating user accepts the request, it [MUST]{.bcp14} then follow the
steps in [Section 4.3](#stirconnect){.xref} to act as an authentication
service and send a signed request with the \"msec\" PASSporT type in its
Identity header as well, in order to enable end‑to-end bidirectional
confidentiality.[¶](#section-4.4-2){.pilcrow}

For the purposes of this profile, the \"msec\" PASSporT type can be used
by authentication services in one of two ways: as a mandatory request
for media security or as a merely opportunistic request for media
security. As any verification service that receives an Identity header
field in a SIP request with an unrecognized PASSporT type will simply
ignore that Identity header, an authentication service will know whether
or not the terminating side supports \"msec\" based on whether or not
its UA receives a signed request in the backwards direction per [Section
4.3](#stirconnect){.xref}. If no such requests are received, the UA may
do one of two things: shut down the dialog, if the policy of the UA
requires that \"msec\" be supported by the terminating side for this
dialog; or, if policy permits (e.g., an explicit acceptance by the
user), allow the dialog to continue without media
security.[¶](#section-4.4-3){.pilcrow}

## [5.](#section-5){.section-number .selfRef} [Media Security Protocols](#name-media-security-protocols){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-media-security-protocols}

As there are several ways to negotiate media security with SDP, any of
which might be used with either opportunistic or comprehensive
protection, further guidance to implementers is needed. In
\[[RFC8643](#RFC8643){.xref}\], opportunistic approaches considered
include DTLS-SRTP, [security descriptions](#RFC4568){.xref}
\[[RFC4568](#RFC4568){.xref}\], and [ZRTP](#RFC6189){.xref}
\[[RFC6189](#RFC6189){.xref}\].[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

Support for DTLS-SRTP is [REQUIRED]{.bcp14} by this
specification.[¶](#section-5-2){.pilcrow}

The \"mky\" claim of PASSporT provides integrity protection for
\"a=fingerprint\" attributes in SDP, including cases where multiple
\"a=fingerprint\" attributes appear in the same
SDP.[¶](#section-5-3){.pilcrow}

## [6.](#section-6){.section-number .selfRef} [Relayed Media and Conferencing](#name-relayed-media-and-conferenc){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-relayed-media-and-conferenc}

Providing end-to-end media confidentiality for SIP is complicated by the
presence of many forms of media relays. While many media relays merely
proxy media to a destination, others present themselves as media
endpoints and terminate security associations before re‑originating
media to its destination.[¶](#section-6-1){.pilcrow}

Centralized conference bridges are one type of entity that typically
terminates a media session in order to mux media from multiple sources
and then to re-originate the muxed media to conference participants. In
many such implementations, only hop-by-hop media confidentiality is
possible. Work is ongoing to specify a means to encrypt both (1) the
hop-by-hop media between a UA and a centralized server and (2) the
end-to-end media between UAs, but it is not sufficiently mature at this
time to become a best practice. Those protocols are expected to identify
their own best-practice recommendations as they
mature.[¶](#section-6-2){.pilcrow}

Another class of entities that might relay SIP media are Back-to-Back
User Agents (B2BUAs). If a B2BUA follows the guidance in
\[[RFC7879](#RFC7879){.xref}\], it may be possible for B2BUAs to act as
media relays while still permitting end-to-end confidentiality between
UAs.[¶](#section-6-3){.pilcrow}

Ultimately, if an endpoint can decrypt media it receives, then that
endpoint can forward the decrypted media without the knowledge or
consent of the media\'s originator. No media confidentiality mechanism
can protect against these sorts of relayed disclosures or against a
legitimate endpoint that can legitimately decrypt media and record a
copy to be sent elsewhere (see
\[[RFC7245](#RFC7245){.xref}\]).[¶](#section-6-4){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-7 .section}
## [7.](#section-7){.section-number .selfRef} [ICE and Connected Identity](#name-ice-and-connected-identity){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-ice-and-connected-identity}

Providing confidentiality for media with comprehensive protection
requires careful timing of when media streams should be sent and when a
user interface should signify that confidentiality is in
place.[¶](#section-7-1){.pilcrow}

In order to best enable end-to-end connectivity between UAs and to avoid
media relays as much as possible, implementations of this specification
[MUST]{.bcp14} support ICE \[[RFC8445](#RFC8445){.xref}\]
\[[RFC8839](#RFC8839){.xref}\]. To speed up call establishment, it is
[RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14} that implementations support Trickle ICE
\[[RFC8838](#RFC8838){.xref}\]
\[[RFC8840](#RFC8840){.xref}\].[¶](#section-7-2){.pilcrow}

Note that in the comprehensive protection case, the use of connected
identity \[[RFC4916](#RFC4916){.xref}\] with ICE implies that the answer
containing the key fingerprints, and thus the STIR signature, will come
in an UPDATE sent in the backwards direction, a provisional response,
and a PRACK, rather than in any earlier SDP body. Only at such a time as
that UPDATE is received will the media keys be considered exchanged in
this case.[¶](#section-7-3){.pilcrow}

Similarly, in order to prevent, or at least mitigate, the
denial-of-service attack described in [Section
19.5.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8445#section-19.5.1){.relref}
of \[[RFC8445](#RFC8445){.xref}\], this specification incorporates best
practices for ensuring that recipients of media flows have consented to
receive such flows. Implementations of this specification [MUST]{.bcp14}
implement the Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) usage for
consent freshness defined in
\[[RFC7675](#RFC7675){.xref}\].[¶](#section-7-4){.pilcrow}
