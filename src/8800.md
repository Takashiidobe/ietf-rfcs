# Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) Extension for Label Switched Path (LSP) Diversity Constraint Signaling {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

This document introduces a simple mechanism to associate a group of
Label Switched Paths (LSPs) via an extension to the Path Computation
Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) with the purpose of computing
diverse (disjointed) paths for those LSPs. The proposed extension allows
a Path Computation Client (PCC) to advertise to a Path Computation
Element (PCE) that a particular LSP belongs to a particular Disjoint
Association Group; thus, the PCE knows that the LSPs in the same group
need to be disjoint from each other.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC5440](#RFC5440){.xref}\] describes the Path Computation Element
Communication Protocol (PCEP), which enables the communication between a
Path Computation Client (PCC) and a Path Control Element (PCE) or
between two PCEs based on the PCE architecture
\[[RFC4655](#RFC4655){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

The PCEP Extensions for Stateful PCE Model
\[[RFC8231](#RFC8231){.xref}\] describes a set of extensions to PCEP to
enable active control of MPLS-TE and GMPLS tunnels.
\[[RFC8281](#RFC8281){.xref}\] describes the setup and teardown of
PCE-initiated LSPs under the active stateful PCE model, without the need
for local configuration on the PCC, thus allowing for a dynamic
network.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC8697](#RFC8697){.xref}\] introduces a generic mechanism to create
a grouping of LSPs in the context of a PCE that can then be used to
define associations between a set of LSPs and a set of attributes (such
as configuration parameters or behaviors) and is equally applicable to
the active and passive modes of a stateful PCE
\[[RFC8231](#RFC8231){.xref}\] or a stateless PCE
\[[RFC4655](#RFC4655){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

This document specifies a PCEP extension to signal that a set of LSPs in
a particular group should use diverse (disjointed) paths, including the
requested type of diversity. Sections [3](#mot){.xref} and
[4](#app){.xref} describe the property and use of a Disjoint Association
Group. A PCC can use this extension to signal to a PCE that a particular
LSP belongs to a particular Disjoint Association Group. When a PCE
receives LSP states belonging to the same Disjoint Association Group
from some PCCs, the PCE should ensure that the LSPs within the group are
disjoint from each other.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

Path diversity is a very common use case in today\'s IP/MPLS networks,
especially for layer 2 transport over MPLS. A customer may request that
the operator provide two end-to-end disjoint paths across the
operator\'s IP/MPLS core. The customer may use these paths as
primary/backup or active/active
configuration.[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

Different levels of disjointness may be
offered:[¶](#section-3-2){.pilcrow}

[Figure 1](#figure-1){.selfRef}: [Disjoint Paths with Different Head
Ends and Tail Ends](#name-disjoint-paths-with-differe){.selfRef}

In the figure above, let us consider that the customer wants to have two
disjoint paths, one between CE1 and CE2 and one between CE3 and CE4.
From an IP/MPLS network point view, in this example, the CEs are
connected to different PEs to maximize their disjointness. When LSPs
originate from different head ends, distributed computation of diverse
paths can be difficult, whereas computation via a centralized PCE
ensures path disjointness, correctness, and
simplicity.[¶](#section-4-2){.pilcrow}

[Section 5.4](#svec){.xref} describes the relationship between the
Disjoint Association Group (DAG) and Synchronization VECtor (SVEC)
object.[¶](#section-4-3){.pilcrow}

The PCEP extension for stateful PCE \[[RFC8231](#RFC8231){.xref}\]
defined new PCEP messages \-- Path Computation Report (PCRpt), Path
Computation Update (PCUpd), and Path Computation Initiate (PCInitiate)
\[[RFC8281](#RFC8281){.xref}\]. These messages use a PLSP-ID in the LSP
object for identification. Moreover, to allow diversity between LSPs
originating from different PCCs, the generic mechanism to create a
grouping of LSPs that is equally applicable to the active and passive
modes of a stateful PCE is described in
\[[RFC8697](#RFC8697){.xref}\].[¶](#section-4-4){.pilcrow}

Using the extension to PCEP defined in this document, the PCC uses the
extension defined in \[[RFC8697](#RFC8697){.xref}\] to indicate that a
group of LSPs are required to be disjoint; such indication should
include disjointness parameters like the type of disjointness, the
Disjoint Association Group identifiers, and any customization parameters
according to the configured local policy.[¶](#section-4-5){.pilcrow}

The management of the Disjoint Association Group IDs will be a key point
for the operator as the Association ID field is limited to 65535. The
local configuration of the IPv4/IPv6 Association Source, or Global
Association Source/Extended Association ID, can overcome this
limitation, as described in \[[RFC8697](#RFC8697){.xref}\]. When a PCC
or PCE initiates all the LSPs in a particular Disjoint Association
Group, it can set the IPv4/IPv6 Association Source as one of its own IP
address. When disjoint LSPs are initiated from different head ends, the
Association Source could be the PCE address or any other unique value to
identify the DAG.[¶](#section-4-6){.pilcrow}

### [5.1.](#section-5.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Association Group](#name-association-group){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-association-group}

As per \[[RFC8697](#RFC8697){.xref}\], LSPs are associated with other
LSPs with which they interact by adding them to a common association
group. As described in \[[RFC8697](#RFC8697){.xref}\], the association
group is uniquely identified by the combination of the following fields
in the ASSOCIATION object: Association Type, Association ID, Association
Source, and (if present) Global Association Source or Extended
Association ID.[¶](#section-5.1-1){.pilcrow}

This document defines a new Association type, called \"Disjoint
Association\" (2), based on the generic ASSOCIATION object. This new
Association type is also called \"DAT\", for \"Disjoint Association
Type\".[¶](#section-5.1-2){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC8697](#RFC8697){.xref}\] specifies the mechanism for the
capability advertisement of the Association types supported by a PCEP
speaker by defining an ASSOC-Type-List TLV to be carried within an OPEN
object. This capability exchange for the DAT (2) [MUST]{.bcp14} be done
before using the disjoint association. Thus, the PCEP speaker
[MUST]{.bcp14} include the DAT in the ASSOC-Type-List TLV and
[MUST]{.bcp14} receive the same from the PCEP peer before using the
Disjoint Association Group (DAG) in PCEP
messages.[¶](#section-5.1-3){.pilcrow}

This Association type is considered to be both dynamic and
operator-configured in nature. As per \[[RFC8697](#RFC8697){.xref}\],
the association group could be manually created by the operator on the
PCEP peers, and the LSPs belonging to this association are conveyed via
PCEP messages to the PCEP peer; alternately, the association group could
be created dynamically by the PCEP speaker, and both the association
group information and the LSPs belonging to the association group are
conveyed to the PCEP peer. The Operator-configured Association Range
[MUST]{.bcp14} be set for this association-type to mark a range of
Association Identifiers that are used for operator-configured
associations to avoid any Association Identifier clash within the scope
of the Association Source. (Refer to
\[[RFC8697](#RFC8697){.xref}\].)[¶](#section-5.1-4){.pilcrow}

A Disjoint Association Group can have two or more LSPs, but a PCE may be
limited in the number of LSPs it can take into account when computing
disjointness. If a PCE receives more LSPs in the group than it can
handle in its computation algorithm, it [SHOULD]{.bcp14} apply
disjointness computation to only a subset of LSPs in the group. The
subset of disjoint LSPs will be decided by PCE as a local policy. Local
polices [MAY]{.bcp14} define the computational behavior for the other
LSPs in the group. For example, the PCE may provide no path, a shortest
path, or a constrained path based on relaxing disjointness, etc. The
disjoint status of the computed path is informed to the PCC via the
DISJOINTNESS-STATUS TLV (see [Section
5.2](#tlvs){.xref}).[¶](#section-5.1-5){.pilcrow}

There are different types of disjointness identified by the flags (T, S,
N, and L) in the DISJOINTNESS-CONFIGURATION TLV (see [Section
5.2](#tlvs){.xref}). All LSPs in a particular Disjoint Association Group
[MUST]{.bcp14} use the same combination of T, S, N, and L flags in the
DISJOINTNESS-CONFIGURATION TLV. If a PCEP peer receives a PCEP message
for LSPs belonging to the same Disjoint Association Group but having an
inconsistent combination of T, S, N, and L flags, the PCEP peer [MUST
NOT]{.bcp14} add the LSPs to the Disjoint Association Group and
[MUST]{.bcp14} reply with a PCErr with Error-Type 26 (Association Error)
and Error-value 6 (Association information
mismatch).[¶](#section-5.1-6){.pilcrow}

A particular LSP [MAY]{.bcp14} be associated to multiple Disjoint
Association Groups, but in that case, the PCE [SHOULD]{.bcp14} try to
consider all the Disjoint Association Groups during path computation, if
possible. Otherwise, a local policy [MAY]{.bcp14} define the
computational behavior. If a PCE does not support such a path
computation, it [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} add the LSP into the association
group and [MUST]{.bcp14} return a PCErr with Error-Type 26 (Association
Error) and Error-value 7 (Cannot join the association
group).[¶](#section-5.1-7){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC5440](#RFC5440){.xref}\] defines a mechanism for the
synchronization of a set of path computation requests by using the SVEC
object, which specifies the list of synchronized requests that can be
either dependent or independent. The SVEC object identifies the
relationship between the set of path computation requests, identified by
\'Request-ID-number\' in the RP (Request Parameters) object.

list for synchronized path computations when computing dependent
requests and describes a number of usage scenarios for SVEC lists within
single-domain and multi-domain
environments.[¶](#section-5.4-1){.pilcrow}

The SVEC object includes a Flags field that indicates the potential

as the Flags field in the TLVs defined in this document. The path
computation request in the Path Computation Request (PCReq) message
[MAY]{.bcp14} use both the SVEC and ASSOCIATION objects to identify the
related path computation request, as well as the DAG. The PCE

different from the one in the SVEC object. The PCE [MUST]{.bcp14}
consider both the objects (including the flags set inside the objects)
as per the processing rules and aim to find a path that meets both of
these constraints. In case no such path is possible, the PCE
[MUST]{.bcp14} send a Path Computation Reply (PCRep) with a NO-PATH
object indicating path computation failure, as per

### [5.5.](#section-5.5){.section-number .selfRef} [P Flag Considerations](#name-p-flag-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-p-flag-considerations}

As mentioned in [Section 5.2](#tlvs){.xref}, the P flag (when set)
indicates that the computed path of the LSP [SHOULD]{.bcp14} satisfy all
constraints and objective functions first without considering the
diversity constraint.[¶](#section-5.5-1){.pilcrow}

This means that an LSP with the P flag set should be placed first, as if
the disjointness constraint has not been configured, while the other
LSPs in the association with the P flag unset should be placed by taking
into account the disjointness constraint. Setting the P flag changes the
relationship between LSPs to a one-sided relationship (LSP 1 with P=0
depends on LSP 2 with P=1, but LSP 2 with P=1 does not depend on LSP 1
with P=0). Multiple LSPs in the same Disjoint Association Group may have
the P flag set. In such a case, those LSPs may not be disjoint from each
other but will be disjoint from other LSPs in the group that have the P
flag unset.[¶](#section-5.5-2){.pilcrow}

This could be required in some primary/backup scenarios where the
primary path should use the more optimal path available (taking into
account the other constraints). When disjointness is computed, it is
important for the algorithm to know that it should try to optimize the
path of one or more LSPs in the Disjoint Association Group (for
instance, the primary path), while other paths are allowed to be
costlier (compared to a similar path without the disjointness
constraint). Without such a hint, the disjointness algorithm may set a
path for all LSPs that may not completely fulfill the customer\'s
requirement.[¶](#section-5.5-3){.pilcrow}

:::

Note: In [Figure 4](#fig4){.xref}, the cost of all the links is 1,
unless explicitly marked otherwise.[¶](#section-5.5-5){.pilcrow}

In the figure above, a customer has two dual-homed sites (CE1/CE3 and
CE2/CE4). Let us consider that this customer wants two link disjoint
paths between the two sites. Due to physical meshing, the customer wants
to use CE1 and CE2 as the primary (and CE3 and CE4 are hosted in a
remote site for redundancy purpose).[¶](#section-5.5-6){.pilcrow}

Without any hint (constraint) provided, the PCE may compute the two link
disjoint LSPs together, leading to PE1-\>PE2 using path
PE1-\>R1-\>R2-\>PE2 and PE3-\>PE4 using PE3-\>R3-\>R4-\>PE4. In this
case, even if the disjointness constraint is fulfilled, the path from
PE1 to PE2 does not use the best optimal path available in the network
(path delay may be higher); the customer requirement is thus not
completely fulfilled.[¶](#section-5.5-7){.pilcrow}

The usage of the P flag allows the PCE to know that a particular LSP
should be tied to the best path, as if the disjointness constraint was
not requested.[¶](#section-5.5-8){.pilcrow}

In our example, if the P flag is set to the LSP PE1-\>PE2, the PCE
should use the path PE1-\>R1-\>R3-\>R4-\>R2-\>PE2 for this LSP, while
the other LSP should be link disjoint from this path. The second LSP
will be placed on PE3-\>R5-\>R6-\>PE4, as it is allowed to be
costlier.[¶](#section-5.5-9){.pilcrow}

Driving the PCE disjointness computation may be done in other ways, for
instance, setting a metric boundary reflecting a path delay boundary.
Other constraints may also be used.[¶](#section-5.5-10){.pilcrow}

The P flag allows to simply express that the disjointness constraint
should not make the LSP worst.[¶](#section-5.5-11){.pilcrow}

Any constraint added to a path disjointness computation may reduce the
chance to find suitable paths. The usage of the P flag, as any other
constraint, may prevent finding a disjoint path. In the example above,
if we consider that router R5 is down and if PE1-\>PE2 has the P flag
set, there is no room available to place PE3-\>PE4 (the link
disjointness constraint cannot be fulfilled). If PE1-\>PE2 has the P
flag unset, the algorithm may be able to place PE1-\>PE2 on the R1-\>R2
link leaving room for PE3-\>PE4 using the R3-\>R4 link. When using the P
flag or any additional constraint on top of the disjointness constraint,
the user should be aware that there is less chance to fulfill the
disjointness constraint.[¶](#section-5.5-12){.pilcrow}

Note: In [Figure 5](#fig5){.xref}, the cost of all the links is 1,
unless explicitly marked otherwise.[¶](#section-5.5-14){.pilcrow}

In the figure above, we still consider the same previous requirements,
so PE1-\>PE2 LSP should be optimized (P flag set), while PE3-\>PE4
should be link disjoint and may use a costlier
path.[¶](#section-5.5-15){.pilcrow}

Regarding PE1-\>PE2, there are two paths that are satisfying the
constraints (ECMP): PE1-\>R1-\>R4-\>R2-\>PE2 (path 1) and
PE1-\>R1-\>R3-\>R4-\>R2-\>PE2 (path 2). An implementation may choose one
of the paths.[¶](#section-5.5-16){.pilcrow}

If the implementation elects only one path, there is a chance that
picking up one path may prevent link disjointness. In our example, if
path 2 is used for PE1-\>PE2, there is no room left for PE3-\>PE4, while
if path 1 is used, PE3-\>PE4 can be placed on R3-\>R4
link.[¶](#section-5.5-17){.pilcrow}

There may be some cases where the PCE is not able to provide a set of
disjoint paths for one or more LSPs in the
association.[¶](#section-5.6-1){.pilcrow}

When the T flag is set (Strict disjointness), if disjointness cannot be
ensured for one or more LSPs, the PCE [MUST]{.bcp14} reply to a PCReq
with a PCRep message containing a NO-PATH object. In case of a PCRpt
message, the PCE [MUST]{.bcp14} return a PCErr message with Error-Type
26 (Association Error) and Error-value 7 (Cannot join the association
group).[¶](#section-5.6-2){.pilcrow}

In case of a network event leading to an impossible strict disjointness,
the PCE [MUST]{.bcp14} send a PCUpd message containing an empty Explicit
Route Object (ERO) to the corresponding PCCs. In addition to the empty
ERO object, the PCE [MAY]{.bcp14} add the NO-PATH-VECTOR TLV
\[[RFC5440](#RFC5440){.xref}\] in the LSP
object.[¶](#section-5.6-3){.pilcrow}

This document adds new bits in the Flags field of the NO-PATH-VECTOR
TLV:[¶](#section-5.6-4){.pilcrow}

-   [bit 11: When set, the PCE indicates that it could not find a
    disjoint path for this
    LSP.[¶](#section-5.6-5.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.6-5.1}
-   [bit 10: When set, the PCE indicates that it does not support the
    requested disjointness
    computation.[¶](#section-5.6-5.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.6-5.2}

When the T flag is unset, the PCE is allowed to relax disjointness by
applying a requested objective function ([Section
5.3](#Disjointness-objective-functions){.xref}) if specified. Otherwise,
if no objective function is specified, the PCE is allowed to reduce the
required level of disjointness as it deems fit. The actual level of
disjointness of the paths computed by the PCE can be reported through
the DISJOINTNESS-STATUS TLV by setting the appropriate flags in the TLV.
While the DISJOINTNESS-CONFIGURATION TLV defines the desired level of
disjointness required by configuration, the DISJOINTNESS-STATUS TLV
defines the achieved level of disjointness
computed.[¶](#section-5.6-6){.pilcrow}

There are some cases where the PCE may need to completely relax the
disjointness constraint in order to provide a path to all the LSPs that
are part of the association. A mechanism that allows the PCE to fully
relax a constraint is considered by the authors as more global to PCEP
rather than linked to the disjointness use case. As a consequence, it is
considered out of scope of the document. See
\[[PCE-OPTIONAL](#I-D.dhody-pce-stateful-pce-optional){.xref}\] for a
proposed mechanism.[¶](#section-5.6-7){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC7470](#RFC7470){.xref}\], and \[[RFC8697](#RFC8697){.xref}\]. But
adding of a spurious LSP into the Disjoint Association Group could lead
to recomputation and setup of all LSPs in the group, which could be used
to overwhelm the PCE and the network.[¶](#section-6-1){.pilcrow}

A spurious LSP can have flags that are inconsistent with those of the
legitimate LSPs of the group and thus cause LSP allocation for the
legitimate LSPs to fail with an error. Also, certain combinations of
flags (notably, the \'T\' bit) can result in conflicts that cannot be
resolved.[¶](#section-6-2){.pilcrow}

Also, as stated in \[[RFC8697](#RFC8697){.xref}\], much of the
information carried in the ASSOCIATION object reflects information that
can also be derived from the LSP database, but association provides a
much easier grouping of related LSPs and messages. This holds true for
the DAT as well; thus, this could provide an adversary with the
opportunity to eavesdrop on the relationship between the LSPs and
understand the network topology.[¶](#section-6-3){.pilcrow}
