## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

This document explains the problems associated with the use of No-Path
Destination Advertisement Object (NPDAO) messaging in RFC 6550 and also
discusses the requirements for an optimized route invalidation messaging
scheme. Further, this document specifies a new proactive route
invalidation message called the \"Destination Cleanup Object\" (DCO),
which fulfills requirements for optimized route invalidation
messaging.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

RPL (the Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks) as defined
in \[[RFC6550](#RFC6550){.xref}\] specifies a proactive
distance-vector-based routing scheme. RPL has optional messaging in the
form of DAO (Destination Advertisement Object) messages, which the 6LBR
(6LoWPAN Border Router) and 6LR (6LoWPAN Router) can use to learn a
route towards the downstream nodes. (\"6LoWPAN\" stands for \"IPv6 over
Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Network\".) In Storing mode, DAO
messages would result in routing entries being created on all
intermediate 6LRs from a node\'s parent all the way towards the
6LBR.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

RPL allows the use of No-Path DAO (NPDAO) messaging to invalidate a
routing path corresponding to the given target, thus releasing resources
utilized on that path. An NPDAO is a DAO message with a route lifetime
of zero. It originates at the target node and always flows upstream
towards the 6LBR. This document explains the problems associated with
the use of NPDAO messaging in \[[RFC6550](#RFC6550){.xref}\] and also
discusses the requirements for an optimized route invalidation messaging
scheme. Further, this document specifies a new proactive route
invalidation message called the \"Destination Cleanup Object\" (DCO),
which fulfills requirements for optimized route invalidation
messaging.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

This document only caters to RPL\'s Storing Mode of Operation (MOP). The
Non-Storing MOP does not require the use of an NPDAO for route
invalidation, since routing entries are not maintained on
6LRs.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

RPL uses NPDAO messaging in Storing mode so that the node changing its
routing adjacencies can invalidate the previous route. This is needed so
that nodes along the previous path can release any resources (such as
the routing entry) they maintain on behalf of the target
node.[¶](#section-1.2-1){.pilcrow}

Node D is connected via preferred parent B. D has an alternate path via
C towards the 6LBR. Node A is the common ancestor for D for paths
through B-G and C-H. When D switches from B to C, RPL allows sending an
NPDAO to B and a regular DAO to C.[¶](#section-1.2-4){.pilcrow}

Resources in LLN nodes are typically constrained. There is limited
memory available, and routing entry records are one of the primary
elements occupying dynamic memory in the nodes. Route invalidation helps
6LR nodes to decide which routing entries can be discarded for better
use of the limited resources. Thus, it becomes necessary to have an
efficient route invalidation mechanism. Also note that a single parent
switch may result in a \"subtree\" switching from one parent to another.
Thus, the route invalidation needs to be done on behalf of the subtree
and not the switching node alone. In the above example, when Node D
switches its parent, route updates need to be done for the routing table
entries of C, H, A, G, and B with destinations D, E, and F. Without
efficient route invalidation, a 6LR may have to hold a lot of stale
route entries.[¶](#section-1.3-1){.pilcrow}

When a node switches its parent, the NPDAO is to be sent to its previous
parent and a regular DAO to its new parent. In cases where the node
switches its parent because of transient or permanent parent link/node
failure, the NPDAO message may not be received by the
parent.[¶](#section-2.1-1){.pilcrow}

### [2.2.](#section-2.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Invalidating Routes of Dependent Nodes](#name-invalidating-routes-of-depe){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-invalidating-routes-of-depe}

RPL does not specify how route invalidation will work for dependent
nodes in the switching node subDAG, resulting in stale routing entries
of the dependent nodes. The only way for a 6LR to invalidate the route
entries for dependent nodes would be to use route lifetime expiry, which
could be substantially high for LLNs.[¶](#section-2.2-1){.pilcrow}

In the example topology, when Node D switches its parent, Node D
generates an NPDAO on its own behalf. There is no NPDAO generated by the
dependent child Nodes E and F, through the previous path via D to B and
G, resulting in stale entries on Nodes B and G for Nodes E and
F.[¶](#section-2.2-2){.pilcrow}

A switching node may generate both an NPDAO and a DAO via two different
paths at almost the same time. It is possible that the NPDAO may
invalidate the previous route and the regular DAO sent via the new path
gets lost on the way. This may result in route downtime, impacting
downward traffic for the switching node.[¶](#section-2.3-1){.pilcrow}

In the example topology, say that Node D switches from parent B to C. An
NPDAO sent via the previous route may invalidate the previous route,
whereas there is no way to determine whether the new DAO has
successfully updated the route entries on the new
path.[¶](#section-2.3-2){.pilcrow}

When the switching node sends the NPDAO message to the previous parent,
it is normal that the link to the previous parent is prone to failure
(that\'s why the node decided to switch). Therefore, it is required that
the route invalidation does not depend on the previous link, which is
prone to failure. The previous link referred to here represents the link
between the node and its previous parent (from which the node is now
disassociating).[¶](#section-3.1-1){.pilcrow}

While sending the NPDAO and DAO messages, it is possible that the NPDAO
successfully invalidates the previous path, while the newly sent DAO
gets lost (new path not set up successfully). This will result in
downstream unreachability to the node switching paths. Therefore, it is
desirable that the route invalidation is synchronized with the DAO to
avoid the risk of route downtime.[¶](#section-3.3-1){.pilcrow}

### [4.1.](#section-4.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Change in RPL Route Invalidation Semantics](#name-change-in-rpl-route-invalid){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-change-in-rpl-route-invalid}

As described in [Section 1.2](#current_npdao){.xref}, the NPDAO
originates at the node changing to a new parent and traverses upstream
towards the root. In order to solve the problems discussed in [Section
2](#current_npdao_problems){.xref}, this document adds a new proactive
route invalidation message called the \"Destination Cleanup Object\"
(DCO), which originates at a common ancestor node and flows downstream
the old path. The common ancestor node generates a DCO when removing a
next hop to a target \-- for instance, as a delayed response to
receiving a regular DAO from another child node with a Path Sequence for
the target that is the same or newer, in which case the DCO transmission
is canceled.[¶](#section-4.1-1){.pilcrow}

The 6LRs in the path for the DCO take such action as route invalidation
based on the DCO information and subsequently send another DCO with the
same information downstream to the next hop(s). This operation is
similar to how the DAOs are handled on intermediate 6LRs in the Storing
MOP \[[RFC6550](#RFC6550){.xref}\]. Just like the DAO in the Storing
MOP, the DCO is sent using link-local unicast source and destination
IPv6 addresses. Unlike the DAO, which always travels upstream, the DCO
always travels downstream.[¶](#section-4.1-2){.pilcrow}

In [Figure 1](#sample_top){.xref}, when child Node D decides to switch
the path from parent B to parent C, it sends a regular DAO to Node C
with reachability information containing the address of D as the target
and an incremented Path Sequence. Node C will update the routing table
based on the reachability information in the DAO and will in turn
generate another DAO with the same reachability information and forward
it to H. Node H recursively follows the same procedure as Node C and
forwards it to Node A. When Node A receives the regular DAO, it finds
that it already has a routing table entry on behalf of the Target
Address of Node D. It finds, however, that the next-hop information for
reaching Node D has changed, i.e., Node D has decided to change the
paths. In this case, Node A, which is the common ancestor node for Node
D along the two paths (previous and new), can generate a DCO that
traverses the network downwards over the old path to the target. Node A
handles normal DAO forwarding to the 6LBR as required by
\[[RFC6550](#RFC6550){.xref}\].[¶](#section-4.1-3){.pilcrow}

### [4.2.](#section-4.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Transit Information Option Changes](#name-transit-information-option-){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-transit-information-option-}

Every RPL message is divided into base message fields and additional
options, as described in [Section
6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6550#section-6){.relref} of
\[[RFC6550](#RFC6550){.xref}\]. The base fields apply to the message as
a whole, and options are appended to add message-specific /
use-case-specific attributes. As an example, a DAO message may be
attributed by one or more \"RPL Target\" options that specify that the
reachability information is for the given targets. Similarly, a Transit
Information option may be associated with a set of RPL Target
options.[¶](#section-4.2-1){.pilcrow}

This document specifies a change in the Transit Information option to
contain the \"Invalidate previous route\" (I) flag. This \'I\' flag
signals the common ancestor node to generate a DCO on behalf of the
target node with a RPL Status of 195, indicating that the address has
moved. The \'I\' flag is carried in the Transit Information option,
which augments the reachability information for a given set of one or
more RPL Targets. A Transit Information option with the \'I\' flag set
should be carried in the DAO message when route invalidation is sought
for the corresponding target or targets.[¶](#section-4.2-2){.pilcrow}

Value 195 represents the \'U\' and \'A\' bits in RPL Status, to be set
as per Figure 6 of \[[RFC9010](#RFC9010){.xref}\], with the lower 6 bits
set to the 6LoWPAN Neighbor Discovery (ND) Extended Address Registration
Option (EARO) Status value of 3 indicating \'Moved\' as per Table 1 of
\[[RFC8505](#RFC8505){.xref}\].[¶](#section-4.2-3){.pilcrow}

I (Invalidate previous route) flag:
:   The \'I\' flag is set by the target node to indicate to the common
    ancestor node that it wishes to invalidate any previous route
    between the two paths.[¶](#section-4.2-5.2){.pilcrow}
:   

\[[RFC6550](#RFC6550){.xref}\] allows the parent address to be sent in
the Transit Information option, depending on the MOP. In the case of the
Storing MOP, the field is usually not needed. In the case of a DCO, the
Parent Address field [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be
included.[¶](#section-4.2-6){.pilcrow}

Upon receiving a DAO message with a Transit Information option that has
the \'I\' flag set, and as a delayed response removing a routing
adjacency to the target indicated in the Transit Information option, the
common ancestor node [SHOULD]{.bcp14} generate a DCO message to the next
hop associated to that adjacency. The \'I\' flag is intended to give the
target node control over its own route invalidation, serving as a signal
to request DCO generation.[¶](#section-4.2-7){.pilcrow}

path receives a DCO with a Path Sequence that is not newer than the Path
Sequence as known from a Transit Information option in a DAO message,
then the 6LR [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} remove its current routing state, and it
[MUST NOT]{.bcp14} forward the DCO down a path where it is not newer. If
the DCO is newer, the 6LR may retain a temporary state to ensure that a

A 6LR may generate an unsolicited DCO to unilaterally clean up the path
on behalf of the target entry. The 6LR has all the state information,
namely, the Target Address and the Path Sequence, required for
generating a DCO in its routing table. The conditions under which a 6LR
may generate an unsolicited DCO are beyond the scope of this document,
but possible reasons could be as follows:[¶](#section-4.5-1){.pilcrow}

1.  [On route expiry of an entry, a 6LR may decide to graciously clean
    up the entry by initiating a
    DCO.[¶](#section-4.5-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.5-2.1}
2.  [A 6LR needs to entertain higher-priority entries in case the
    routing table is full, thus resulting in eviction of an existing
    routing entry. In this case, the eviction can be handled graciously
    by using a DCO.[¶](#section-4.5-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.5-2.2}

A DCO that is generated asynchronously to a DAO message and is meant to
discard all state along the path regardless of the Path Sequence
[MUST]{.bcp14} use a Path Sequence value of 240 (see [Section
7.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6550#section-7.2){.relref} of
\[[RFC6550](#RFC6550){.xref}\]). This value allows the DCO to win
against any established DAO path but to lose against a DAO path that is
being installed. Note that if an ancestor initiates a unilateral path
cleanup on an established path using a DCO with a Path Sequence value of
240, the DCO will eventually reach the target node, which will thus be
informed of the path invalidation.[¶](#section-4.5-3){.pilcrow}

The RPL specification \[[RFC6550](#RFC6550){.xref}\] does not provide a
mechanism for route invalidation for dependent nodes. This document
allows the invalidation of dependent nodes. Dependent nodes will
generate their respective DAOs to update their paths, and the previous
route invalidation for those nodes should work in a manner similar to
what is described for a switching node. The dependent node may set the
\'I\' flag in the Transit Information option as part of a regular DAO so
as to request invalidation of the previous route from the common
ancestor node.[¶](#section-4.6.1-1){.pilcrow}

Dependent nodes do not have any indication regarding whether any of
their parents have in turn decided to switch their parent. Thus, for
route invalidation, the dependent nodes may choose to always set the
\'I\' flag in all their DAO messages\' Transit Information options. Note
that setting the \'I\' flag is not counterproductive even if there is no
previous route to be invalidated.[¶](#section-4.6.1-2){.pilcrow}

The NPDAO mechanism provided in \[[RFC6550](#RFC6550){.xref}\] can still
be used in the same network where a DCO is used. NPDAO messaging can be
used, for example, on route lifetime expiry of the target or when the
node simply decides to gracefully terminate the RPL session on graceful
node shutdown. Moreover, a deployment can have a mix of nodes supporting
the DCO and the existing NPDAO mechanism. It is also possible that the
same node supports both NPDAO and DCO signaling for route
invalidation.[¶](#section-4.6.2-1){.pilcrow}

[Section
9.8](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6550#section-9.8){.relref} of
\[[RFC6550](#RFC6550){.xref}\] states, \"When a node removes a node from
its DAO parent set, it [SHOULD]{.bcp14} send a No-Path DAO message
(Section 6.4.3) to that removed DAO parent to invalidate the existing
route.\" This document introduces an alternative and more optimized way
to perform route invalidation, but it also allows existing NPDAO
messaging to work. Thus, an implementation has two choices to make when
a route invalidation is to be initiated:[¶](#section-4.6.2-2){.pilcrow}

1.  [Use an NPDAO to invalidate the previous route, and send a regular
    DAO on the new
    path.[¶](#section-4.6.2-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.6.2-3.1}
2.  [Send a regular DAO on the new path with the \'I\' flag set in the
    Transit Information option such that the common ancestor node
    initiates the DCO message downstream to invalidate the previous
    route.[¶](#section-4.6.2-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.6.2-3.2}

This document recommends using option 2, for the reasons specified in
[Section 3](#requirements){.xref} of this
document.[¶](#section-4.6.2-4){.pilcrow}

This document assumes that all the 6LRs in the network support this
specification. If there are 6LR nodes that do not support this document
that are in the path of the DCO message transmission, then the route
invalidation for the corresponding targets (targets that are in the DCO
message) may not work or may work partially. Alternatively, a node could
generate an NPDAO if it does not receive a DCO with itself as the target
within a specified time limit. The specified time limit is deployment
specific and depends upon the maximum depth of the network and per-hop
average latency. Note that sending an NPDAO and a DCO for the same
operation would not result in unwanted side effects because the
acceptability of an NPDAO or a DCO depends upon the Path Sequence
freshness.[¶](#section-4.6.2-5){.pilcrow}

A DCO message could be retried by a sender if it sets the \'K\' flag and
does not receive a DCO-ACK. The DCO retry time could be dependent on the
maximum depth of the network and average per-hop latency. This could
range from 2 seconds to 120 seconds, depending on the deployment. If the
latency limits are not known, an implementation [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} retry
more than once in 3 seconds and [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} retry more than three
times.[¶](#section-4.6.3-1){.pilcrow}

The number of retries could also be set depending on how critical the
route invalidation could be for the deployment and the link-layer retry
configuration. For networks supporting only Multi-Point to Point (MP2P)
and Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) flows, such as in Advanced Metering
Infrastructure (AMI) and telemetry applications, the 6LRs may not be
very keen to invalidate routes, unless they are highly memory
constrained. For home and building automation networks that may have
substantial P2P traffic, the 6LRs might be keen to invalidate
efficiently because it may additionally impact forwarding
efficiency.[¶](#section-4.6.3-2){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC6550](#RFC6550){.xref}\] allows a node to select multiple
preferred parents for route establishment. [Section
9.2.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6550#section-9.2.1){.relref} of
\[[RFC6550](#RFC6550){.xref}\] specifies, \"All DAOs generated at the
same time for the same target [MUST]{.bcp14} be sent with the same Path
Sequence in the Transit Information.\" Subsequently, when route
invalidation has to be initiated, an NPDAO, which can be initiated with
an updated Path Sequence to all the parent nodes through which the route
is to be invalidated, can be used; see
\[[RFC6550](#RFC6550){.xref}\].[¶](#section-4.6.4-1){.pilcrow}

With a DCO, the target node itself does not initiate the route
invalidation; this is left to the common ancestor node. A common
ancestor node when it discovers an updated DAO from a new next hop, it
initiates a DCO. It is recommended that an implementation initiate a DCO
after a time period (DelayDCO) such that the common ancestor node may
receive updated DAOs from all possible next hops. This will help to
reduce DCO control overhead, i.e., the common ancestor can wait for
updated DAOs from all possible directions before initiating a DCO for
route invalidation. After timeout, the DCO needs to be generated for all
the next hops for which the route invalidation needs to be
done.[¶](#section-4.6.4-2){.pilcrow}

This document recommends using a DelayDCO timer value of 1 second. This
value is inspired by the default DelayDAO timer value of 1 second
\[[RFC6550](#RFC6550){.xref}\]. Here, the hypothesis is that the DAOs
from all possible parent sets would be received on the common ancestor
within this time period.[¶](#section-4.6.4-3){.pilcrow}

It is still possible that a DCO is generated before all the updated DAOs
from all the paths are received. In this case, the ancestor node would
start the invalidation procedure for paths from which the updated DAO is
not received. The DCO generated in this case would start invalidating
the segments along these paths on which the updated DAOs are not
received. But once the DAO reaches these segments, the routing state
would be updated along these segments; this should not lead to any
inconsistent routing states.[¶](#section-4.6.4-4){.pilcrow}

Note that there is no requirement for synchronization between a DCO and
DAOs. The DelayDCO timer simply ensures that DCO control overhead can be
reduced and is only needed when the network contains nodes using
multiple preferred parents.[¶](#section-4.6.4-5){.pilcrow}

This document introduces the ability for a common ancestor node to
invalidate a route on behalf of the target node. The common ancestor
node could be directed to do so by the target node, using the \'I\' flag
in a DCO\'s Transit Information option. However, the common ancestor
node is in a position to unilaterally initiate the route invalidation,
since it possesses all the required state information, namely, the
Target Address and the corresponding Path Sequence. Thus, a rogue common
ancestor node could initiate such an invalidation and impact the traffic
to the target node.[¶](#section-6-1){.pilcrow}

The DCO carries a RPL Status value, which is informative. New Status
values may be created over time, and a node will ignore an unknown
Status value. This enables the RPL Status field to be used as a cover
channel. But the channel only works once, since the message destroys its
own medium, i.e., the existing route that it is
removing.[¶](#section-6-2){.pilcrow}

This document also introduces an \'I\' flag, which is set by the target
node and used by the ancestor node to initiate a DCO if the ancestor
sees an update in the routing adjacency. However, this flag could be
spoofed by a malicious 6LR in the path and can cause invalidation of an
existing active path. Note that invalidation will work only if the Path
Sequence condition is also met for the target for which the invalidation
is attempted. Having said that, such a malicious 6LR may spoof a DAO on
behalf of the (sub) child with the \'I\' flag set and can cause route
invalidation on behalf of the (sub) child node. Note that by using
existing mechanisms offered by \[[RFC6550](#RFC6550){.xref}\], a
malicious 6LR might also spoof a DAO with a lifetime of zero or
otherwise cause denial of service by dropping traffic entirely, so the
new mechanism described in this document does not present a
substantially increased risk of disruption.[¶](#section-6-3){.pilcrow}

This document assumes that the security mechanisms as defined in
\[[RFC6550](#RFC6550){.xref}\] are followed, which means that the common
ancestor node and all the 6LRs are part of the RPL network because they
have the required credentials. A non-secure RPL network needs to take
into consideration the risks highlighted in this section as well as
those highlighted in
\[[RFC6550](#RFC6550){.xref}\].[¶](#section-6-4){.pilcrow}

All RPL messages support a secure version of messages; this allows
integrity protection using either a Message Authentication Code (MAC) or
a signature. Optionally, secured RPL messages also have encryption
protection for confidentiality.[¶](#section-6-5){.pilcrow}

This document adds new messages (DCO and DCO-ACK) that are syntactically
similar to existing RPL messages such as DAO and DAO-ACK. Secure
versions of DCO and DCO-ACK messages are added in a way that is similar
to the technique used for other RPL messages (such as DAO and
DAO-ACK).[¶](#section-6-6){.pilcrow}

RPL supports three security modes, as mentioned in [Section

    that the next hop for target D is different (i.e., Node G). Node A
    checks the I_flag and generates the DCO(tgt=D,pathseq=x+1) to the
    previous next hop for target D, which is G. Subsequently, Node A
    updates the routing entry and forwards the reachability information
    of target D upstream using the
    DAO(tgt=D,pathseq=x+1,I_flag=1).[¶](#section-a.1-2.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-a.1-2.5}
6.  [Node G receives the DCO(tgt=D,pathseq=x+1). It checks to see if the
    received Path Sequence is later than the stored Path Sequence. If it
    is later, Node G invalidates the routing entry of target D and
    forwards the (un)reachability information downstream to B in the
    DCO(tgt=D,pathseq=x+1).[¶](#section-a.1-2.6){.pilcrow}]{#section-a.1-2.6}
7.  [Similarly, B processes the DCO(tgt=D,pathseq=x+1) by invalidating
    the routing entry of target D and forwards the (un)reachability
    information downstream to
    D.[¶](#section-a.1-2.7){.pilcrow}]{#section-a.1-2.7}
8.  [D ignores the DCO(tgt=D,pathseq=x+1), since the target is

9.  [The propagation of the DCO will stop at any node where the node
    does not have routing information associated with the target. If
    cached routing information is present and the cached Path Sequence
    is higher than the value in the DCO, then the DCO is
    dropped.[¶](#section-a.1-2.9){.pilcrow}]{#section-a.1-2.9}

1.  [(N41) sends a DAO(tgt=N41,PS=x,I_flag=1) to (N32) and (N33). Here,
    \'I_flag\' refers to the Invalidation flag, and \'PS\' refers to the
    Path Sequence in the Transit Information
    option.[¶](#section-a.2-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-a.2-3.1}
2.  [(N32) sends the DAO(tgt=N41,PS=x,I_flag=1) to (N22). (N33) also
    sends the DAO(tgt=N41,PS=x,I_flag=1) to (N22). (N22) learns multiple
    routes for the same destination (N41) through multiple next hops.
    (N22) may receive the DAOs from (N32) and (N33) in any order with
    the I_flag set. The implementation should use the DelayDCO timer to
    wait to initiate the DCO. If (N22) receives an updated DAO from all
    the paths, then the DCO need not be initiated in this case. Thus,
    the routing table at N22 should contain (Dst,NextHop,PS): {
    (N41,N32,x), (N41,N33,x)
    }.[¶](#section-a.2-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-a.2-3.2}
3.  [(N22) sends the DAO(tgt=N41,PS=x,I_flag=1) to
    (N11).[¶](#section-a.2-3.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-a.2-3.3}
4.  [(N11) sends the DAO(tgt=N41,PS=x,I_flag=1) to (6LBR). Thus, the
    complete path is
    established.[¶](#section-a.2-3.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-a.2-3.4}
5.  [(N41) decides to change the preferred parent set from { N32, N33 }
    to { N31, N32 }.[¶](#section-a.2-3.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-a.2-3.5}
6.  [(N41) sends the DAO(tgt=N41,PS=x+1,I_flag=1) to (N32). (N41) sends
    the DAO(tgt=N41,PS=x+1,I_flag=1) to
    (N31).[¶](#section-a.2-3.6){.pilcrow}]{#section-a.2-3.6}
7.  [(N32) sends the DAO(tgt=N41,PS=x+1,I_flag=1) to (N22). (N22) has
    multiple routes to destination (N41). It sees that a new Path
    Sequence for Target=N41 is received and thus waits for a
    predetermined time period (the DelayDCO time period) to invalidate
    another route { (N41),(N33),x }.  After the time period, (N22) sends
    the DCO(tgt=N41,PS=x+1) to (N33). Also (N22) sends the regular
    DAO(tgt=N41,PS=x+1,I_flag=1) to
    (N11).[¶](#section-a.2-3.7){.pilcrow}]{#section-a.2-3.7}
8.  [(N33) receives the DCO(tgt=N41,PS=x+1). The received Path Sequence
    is the latest and thus invalidates the entry associated with the
    target (N41). (N33) then sends the DCO(tgt=N41,PS=x+1) to (N41).
    (N41) sees itself as the target and drops the
    DCO.[¶](#section-a.2-3.8){.pilcrow}]{#section-a.2-3.8}
9.  [From Step 6 above, (N31) receives the DAO(tgt=N41,PS=x+1,I_flag=1).
    It creates a routing entry and sends the
    DAO(tgt=N41,PS=x+1,I_flag=1) to (N21). Similarly, (N21) receives the
    DAO and subsequently sends the DAO(tgt=N41,PS=x+1,I_flag=1) to
    (N11).[¶](#section-a.2-3.9){.pilcrow}]{#section-a.2-3.9}
10. [(N11) receives the DAO(tgt=N41,PS=x+1,I_flag=1) from (N21). It
    waits for the DelayDCO timer, since it has multiple routes to (N41).
    (N41) will receive the DAO(tgt=N41,PS=x+1,I_flag=1) from (N22) from
    Step 7 above. Thus, (N11) has received the regular
    DAO(tgt=N41,PS=x+1,I_flag=1) from all paths and thus does not
    initiate the
    DCO.[¶](#section-a.2-3.10){.pilcrow}]{#section-a.2-3.10}
11. [(N11) forwards the DAO(tgt=N41,PS=x+1,I_flag=1) to (6LBR), and the
    full path is
    established.[¶](#section-a.2-3.11){.pilcrow}]{#section-a.2-3.11}
