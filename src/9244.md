# RFC 9244 {#rfcnum}

# Distributed Denial-of-Service Open Threat Signaling (DOTS) Telemetry {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

This document aims to enrich the Distributed Denial-of-Service Open
Threat Signaling (DOTS) signal channel protocol with various telemetry
attributes, allowing for optimal Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS)
attack mitigation. It specifies the normal traffic baseline and attack
traffic telemetry attributes a DOTS client can convey to its DOTS server
in the mitigation request, the mitigation status telemetry attributes a
DOTS server can communicate to a DOTS client, and the mitigation
efficacy telemetry attributes a DOTS client can communicate to a DOTS
server. The telemetry attributes can assist the mitigator in choosing
the DDoS mitigation techniques and performing optimal DDoS attack
mitigation.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

This document specifies two YANG modules: one for representing DOTS
telemetry message types and one for sharing the attack mapping details
over the DOTS data channel.[¶](#section-abstract-2){.pilcrow}

IT organizations and service providers are facing Distributed
Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks that fall into two broad
categories:[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

1.  ::: {#section-1-2.1}
    Network-layer and transport-layer attacks target the victim\'s
    infrastructure. These attacks are not necessarily aimed at taking
    down the actual delivered services; rather, these attacks prevent
    various network elements (routers, switches, firewalls, transit
    links, and so on) from serving legitimate users\'
    traffic.[¶](#section-1-2.1.1){.pilcrow}

    The main method of such attacks is to send a large volume of traffic
    (e.g., high-pps (packets per second) traffic) toward the victim\'s
    infrastructure. Typically, attack volumes may vary from a few
    hundred Mbps to hundreds of Gbps or even Tbps. Attacks are commonly
    carried out leveraging botnets and attack reflectors for
    amplification attacks ([Section
    3.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4732#section-3.1){.relref} of
    \[[RFC4732](#RFC4732){.xref}\]) such as NTP (Network Time Protocol),
    DNS (Domain Name System), SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol),
    or SSDP (Simple Service Discovery
    Protocol).[¶](#section-1-2.1.2){.pilcrow}
    :::

2.  ::: {#section-1-2.2}
    Application-layer attacks target various applications. Typical
    examples include attacks against HTTP/HTTPS, DNS, SIP (Session
    Initiation Protocol), or SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol).
    However, all applications with their port numbers open at network
    edges can be attractive attack
    targets.[¶](#section-1-2.2.1){.pilcrow}

    Application-layer attacks are considered more complex and harder to
    categorize and are therefore harder to detect and mitigate
    efficiently.[¶](#section-1-2.2.2){.pilcrow}
    :::

To compound the problem, attackers also leverage multi-vectored attacks.
These attacks are assembled from dynamic network-layer and
application-layer attack vectors and other tactics. As such, multiple
attack vectors formed by multiple attack types and volumes are launched
simultaneously toward a victim. Multi-vector attacks are harder to
detect and defend against. Multiple and simultaneous mitigation
techniques are needed to defeat such attack campaigns. It is also common
for attackers to change attack vectors right after a successful
mitigation, burdening their opponents with changing their defense
methods.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

The conclusion derived from the aforementioned attack scenarios is that
modern attack detection and mitigation are most certainly complicated
and highly convoluted tasks. They demand a comprehensive knowledge of
the attack attributes and the normal behavior of the targeted systems
(including normal traffic patterns), as well as the attacker\'s ongoing
and past actions. Even more challenging, retrieving all the analytics
needed for detecting these attacks is not simple with the industry\'s
current reporting capabilities.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

The Distributed Denial-of-Service Open Threat Signaling (DOTS) signal
channel protocol \[[RFC9132](#RFC9132){.xref}\] is used to carry
information about a network resource or a network (or a part thereof)
that is under a DDoS attack. Such information is sent by a DOTS client
to one or multiple DOTS servers so that appropriate mitigation actions
are undertaken on traffic deemed suspicious. Various use cases are
discussed in \[[RFC8903](#RFC8903){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}

DOTS clients can be integrated within a DDoS attack detector or within
network and security elements that have been actively engaged with
ongoing attacks. The DOTS client mitigation environment determines that
it is no longer possible or practical for it to handle these attacks
itself. This can be due to a lack of resources or security capabilities,
as derived from the complexities and intensity of these attacks. In this
circumstance, the DOTS client has invaluable knowledge about the actual
attacks that need to be handled by its DOTS server(s). By enabling the
DOTS client to share this comprehensive knowledge of an ongoing attack
under specific circumstances, the DOTS server can drastically increase
its ability to accomplish successful mitigation. While the attack is
being handled by the mitigation resources associated with the DOTS
server, the DOTS server has knowledge about the ongoing attack
mitigation. The DOTS server can share this information with the DOTS
client so that the client can better assess and evaluate the actual
mitigation realized.[¶](#section-1-6){.pilcrow}

DOTS clients can send mitigation hints derived from attack details to
DOTS servers, with the full understanding that a DOTS server may ignore
mitigation hints, as described in \[[RFC8612](#RFC8612){.xref}\]
(Gen-004). Mitigation hints will be transmitted across the DOTS signal
channel, as the data channel may not be functional during an attack. How
a DOTS server handles normal and attack traffic attributes, and
mitigation hints, is implementation specific.[¶](#section-1-7){.pilcrow}

Both DOTS clients and servers can benefit from this information by
presenting various information details in relevant management,
reporting, and portal systems.[¶](#section-1-8){.pilcrow}

This document defines DOTS telemetry attributes that can be conveyed by
DOTS clients to DOTS servers, and vice versa. The DOTS telemetry
attributes are not mandatory attributes of the DOTS signal channel
protocol \[[RFC9132](#RFC9132){.xref}\]. When no limitation policy is
provided to a DOTS agent, it can signal available telemetry attributes
to its peers in order to optimize the overall mitigation service
provisioned using DOTS. The aforementioned policy can be, for example,
agreed upon during a service subscription (which is out of scope for
this document) to identify a subset of DOTS clients among those deployed
in a DOTS client domain that are allowed to send or receive telemetry
data.[¶](#section-1-9){.pilcrow}

\"DOTS telemetry\" is defined as the collection of attributes that are

mitigation measures, and any related information that may help in
enforcing countermeasures. \"DOTS telemetry\" is an optional set of
attributes that can be signaled in the DOTS signal channel
protocol.[¶](#section-2-3){.pilcrow}

The Telemetry Setup Identifier (tsid) is an identifier that is generated
by DOTS clients to uniquely identify DOTS telemetry setup configuration
data. See [Section 7.1.2](#PUT){.xref} for more
details.[¶](#section-2-4){.pilcrow}

The Telemetry Identifier (tmid) is an identifier that is generated by
DOTS clients to uniquely identify DOTS telemetry data that is
communicated prior to or during a mitigation. See [Section
8.2](#preCtoS){.xref} for more details.[¶](#section-2-5){.pilcrow}

\"Overlapped\" lower numeric \'tsid\' (or \'tmid\') refers to the lower

The term \"pipe\" represents the maximum level of traffic that the DOTS

group of network interfaces is deployment specific. For example, each
interconnection link may be considered as a specific pipe if the DOTS

DOTS client domain as a single pipe when communicating with a DOTS

Timely and effective signaling of up-to-date DDoS telemetry to all
elements involved in the mitigation process is essential and improves
the overall DDoS mitigation service\'s effectiveness. Bidirectional
feedback between DOTS agents is required for increased awareness by each
party of the attack and mitigation efforts, supporting a superior and
highly efficient attack mitigation service.[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-3.1 .section}
### [3.1.](#section-3.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Need for More Visibility](#name-need-for-more-visibility){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-need-for-more-visibility}

When signaling a mitigation request, it is most certainly beneficial for
DOTS clients to signal to DOTS servers any knowledge regarding ongoing
attacks. This can happen in cases where DOTS clients are asking DOTS
servers for support in defending against attacks that they have already
detected and/or (partially) mitigated.[¶](#section-3.1-1){.pilcrow}

If attacks are already detected and categorized within a DOTS client
domain, the DOTS server, and its associated mitigation services, can
proactively benefit from this information and optimize the overall
service delivery. It is important to note that DOTS client domains\' and
DOTS server domains\' detection and mitigation approaches can be
different and can potentially result in different results and attack
classifications. The DDoS mitigation service treats the ongoing attack
details received from DOTS clients as hints and cannot completely rely
on or trust the attack details conveyed by DOTS
clients.[¶](#section-3.1-2){.pilcrow}

In addition to the DOTS server directly using telemetry data as
operational hints, the DOTS server\'s security operation team also
benefits from telemetry data. A basic requirement of security operation
teams is to be aware of and get visibility into the attacks they need to
handle. This holds especially for the case of ongoing attacks, where
DOTS telemetry provides data about the current attack status. Even if
some mitigation can be automated, operational teams can use the DOTS
telemetry information to be prepared for attack mitigation and to assign
the correct resources (e.g., operation staff, networking resources,
mitigation resources) for the specific service. Similarly, security
operations personnel at the DOTS client side ask for feedback about
their requests for protection. Therefore, it is valuable for DOTS
servers to share DOTS telemetry with DOTS
clients.[¶](#section-3.1-3){.pilcrow}

Mutual sharing of information is thus crucial for \"closing the
mitigation loop\" between DOTS clients and servers. For the server-side
team, it is important to confirm that the same attacks that the DOTS
server\'s mitigation resources are seeing are those for which a DOTS
client is requesting mitigation. For the DOTS client-side team, it is
important to realize that the DOTS clients receive the required service
\-- for example, understanding that \"I asked for mitigation of two
attacks, and my DOTS server detects and mitigates only one of them.\"
Cases of inconsistency in attack classification between DOTS clients and
servers can be highlighted, and maybe handled, using the DOTS telemetry
attributes.[¶](#section-3.1-4){.pilcrow}

In addition, management and orchestration systems, at both the DOTS
client and server sides, can use DOTS telemetry as feedback to automate
various control and management activities derived from signaled
telemetry information.[¶](#section-3.1-5){.pilcrow}

If the DOTS server\'s mitigation resources have the capabilities to
facilitate the DOTS telemetry, the DOTS server adapts its protection
strategy and activates the required countermeasures immediately
(automation enabled) for the sake of optimized attack mitigation
decisions and actions. Discussion regarding the interface from the DOTS
server to the mitigator to signal the telemetry data is out of scope for
this document.[¶](#section-3.1-6){.pilcrow}
:::

::: {#section-3.2 .section}
### [3.2.](#section-3.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Enhanced Detection](#name-enhanced-detection){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-enhanced-detection}

DOTS telemetry can also be used as input for determining what values to
use for the tuning parameters available on the mitigation resources.
During the last few years, DDoS attack detection technologies have
evolved from threshold-based detection (that is, cases when all or
specific parts of traffic cross a predefined threshold for a certain
period of time is considered as an attack) to an \"anomaly detection\"
approach. For the latter, it is required to maintain rigorous learning
of \"normal\" behavior, and an \"anomaly\" (or an attack) is identified
and categorized based on the knowledge about the normal behavior and a
deviation from this normal behavior. Statistical and artificial
intelligence algorithms (e.g., machine learning) are used such that the
actual traffic thresholds are automatically calculated by learning the
protected entity\'s normal traffic behavior during \'idle\' time (i.e.,
no mitigation is active). The normal traffic characterization learned is
referred to as the \"normal traffic baseline\". An attack is detected
when the victim\'s actual traffic is deviating from this normal baseline
pattern.[¶](#section-3.2-1){.pilcrow}

In addition, subsequent activities toward mitigating an attack are much
more challenging. The ability to distinguish legitimate traffic from
attacker traffic on a per-packet basis is complex. For example, a packet
may look \"legitimate\" and no attack signature can be identified. The
anomaly can be identified only after detailed statistical analysis. DDoS
attack mitigators use the normal baseline during the mitigation of an
attack to identify and categorize the expected appearance of a specific
traffic pattern. Particularly, the mitigators use the normal baseline to
recognize the \"level of normality\" that needs to be achieved during
the various mitigation processes.[¶](#section-3.2-2){.pilcrow}

Normal baseline calculation is performed based on continuous learning of
the normal behavior of the protected entities. The minimum learning
period varies from hours to days and even weeks, depending on the
protected applications\' behavior. The baseline cannot be learned during
active attacks because attack conditions do not characterize the
protected entities\' normal behavior.[¶](#section-3.2-3){.pilcrow}

If the DOTS client has calculated the normal baseline of its protected
entities, signaling such information to the DOTS server along with the
attack traffic levels provides value. The DOTS server benefits from this
telemetry by tuning its mitigation resources with the DOTS client\'s
normal baseline. The DOTS server\'s mitigators use the baseline to
familiarize themselves with the attack victim\'s normal behavior and
target the baseline as the level of normality they need to achieve. Fed
with this information, the overall mitigation performance is expected to
be improved in terms of time to mitigate, accuracy, and false-negative
and false-positive rates.[¶](#section-3.2-4){.pilcrow}

Mitigation of attacks without having certain knowledge of normal traffic
can be inaccurate at best. This is especially true for recursive
signaling (see [Section
3.2.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8811#section-3.2.3){.relref} of
\[[RFC8811](#RFC8811){.xref}\]). Given that DOTS clients can be
integrated in a highly diverse set of scenarios and use cases, this
emphasizes the need for knowledge of the behavior of each DOTS client
domain \-- especially given that common global thresholds for attack
detection can almost never be realized. Each DOTS client domain can have
its own levels of traffic and normal behavior. Without facilitating
normal baseline signaling, it may be very difficult for DOTS servers in
some cases to detect and mitigate the attacks
accurately:[¶](#section-3.2-5){.pilcrow}

-   [It is important to emphasize that it is practically impossible for
    the DOTS server\'s mitigators to calculate the normal baseline in
    cases where they do not have any knowledge of the traffic
    beforehand.[¶](#section-3.2-6.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.2-6.1}

Of course, this information can be provided using out-of-band mechanisms
or manual configuration, at the risk of unmaintained information
becoming inaccurate as the network evolves and \"normal\" patterns
change. The use of a dynamic and collaborative means between the DOTS
client and server to identify and share key parameters for the sake of
efficient DDoS protection is valuable.[¶](#section-3.2-7){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-3.3 .section}
### [3.3.](#section-3.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Efficient Mitigation](#name-efficient-mitigation){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-efficient-mitigation}

During a high-volume attack, DOTS client pipes can be totally saturated.
DOTS clients ask their DOTS servers to handle the attack upstream so
that DOTS client pipes return to a reasonable load level (normal
pattern, ideally). At this point, it is essential to ensure that the
mitigator does not overwhelm the DOTS client pipes by sending back large
volumes of \"clean traffic\", or what it believes is \"clean\". This can
happen when the mitigator has not managed to detect and mitigate all the
attacks launched toward the DOTS client
domain.[¶](#section-3.3-1){.pilcrow}

In this case, it can be valuable to DOTS clients to signal to DOTS
servers the total pipe capacity, which is the level of traffic the DOTS
client domain can absorb from its upstream network. This is usually the
circuit size, which includes all the packet overheads. Dynamic updates
of the condition of pipes between DOTS agents while they are under a
DDoS attack are essential (e.g., where multiple DOTS clients share the
same physical connectivity pipes). The DOTS server should activate other
mechanisms to ensure that it does not allow the DOTS client domain\'s
pipes to be saturated unintentionally. The rate-limit action defined in
\[[RFC8783](#RFC8783){.xref}\] is a reasonable candidate to achieve this
objective; the DOTS client can indicate the type(s) of traffic (such as
ICMP, UDP, TCP port number 80) it prefers to limit. The rate-limit
action can be controlled via the signal channel
\[[RFC9133](#RFC9133){.xref}\] even when the pipe is
overwhelmed.[¶](#section-3.3-2){.pilcrow}

The DOTS protocol suite is divided into two logical channels: the signal
channel \[[RFC9132](#RFC9132){.xref}\] and data channel
\[[RFC8783](#RFC8783){.xref}\]. This division is due to the vastly
different requirements placed upon the traffic they carry. The DOTS
signal channel must remain available and usable even in the face of
attack traffic that might, for example, saturate one direction of the
links involved, rendering acknowledgment-based mechanisms unreliable and
strongly incentivizing messages to be small enough to be contained in a
single IP packet ([Section
2.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8612#section-2.2){.relref} of
\[[RFC8612](#RFC8612){.xref}\]). In contrast, the DOTS data channel is
available for high-bandwidth data transfer before or after an attack,
using more conventional transport protocol techniques ([Section
2.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8612#section-2.3){.relref} of
\[[RFC8612](#RFC8612){.xref}\]). It is generally preferable to perform
advance configuration over the DOTS data channel, including configuring
aliases for static or nearly static data sets such as sets of network
addresses/prefixes that might be subject to related attacks. This design
helps to optimize the use of the DOTS signal channel for the small
messages that are important to deliver during an attack. As a reminder,
the DOTS signal channel and data channel both require secure
communication channels ([Section
11](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9132#section-11){.relref} of
\[[RFC9132](#RFC9132){.xref}\] and [Section
10](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8783#section-10){.relref} of
\[[RFC8783](#RFC8783){.xref}\]).[¶](#section-4.1-1){.pilcrow}

Telemetry information has aspects that correspond to both operational
modes (i.e., signal channel and data channel): there is certainly a need
to convey updated information about ongoing attack traffic and targets
during an attack, so as to convey detailed information about mitigation
status and inform updates to mitigation strategy in the face of adaptive
attacks. However, it is also useful to provide mitigation services with
a picture of normal or \"baseline\" traffic toward potential targets to
aid in detecting when incoming traffic deviates from normal into being
an attack. Also, one might populate a \"database\" of classifications of
known types of attacks so that a short attack identifier can be used
during an attack period to describe an observed attack. This
specification does make provision for use of the DOTS data channel for
the latter function ([Section 8.1.6](#vam){.xref}) but otherwise retains
most telemetry functionality in the DOTS signal
channel.[¶](#section-4.1-2){.pilcrow}

Note that it is a functional requirement to convey information about
ongoing attack traffic during an attack, and information about baseline
traffic uses an essentially identical data structure that is naturally
defined to sit next to the description of attack traffic. The related
telemetry setup information used to parameterize actual traffic data is
also sent over the signal channel, out of
expediency.[¶](#section-4.1-3){.pilcrow}

This document specifies an extension to the DOTS signal channel
protocol. Considerations about how to establish, maintain, and make use
of the DOTS signal channel are specified in
\[[RFC9132](#RFC9132){.xref}\].[¶](#section-4.1-4){.pilcrow}

Once the DOTS signal channel is established, DOTS clients that support
the DOTS telemetry extension proceed with the telemetry setup
configuration (e.g., measurement interval, telemetry notification
interval, pipe capacity, normal traffic baseline) as detailed in
[Section 7](#conf){.xref}. DOTS agents can then include DOTS telemetry
attributes using the DOTS signal channel ([Section 8.1](#pre){.xref}). A
DOTS client can use separate messages to share with its DOTS server(s) a
set of telemetry data bound to an ongoing mitigation ([Section
8.2](#preCtoS){.xref}). Also, a DOTS client that is interested in
receiving telemetry notifications related to some of its resources
follows the procedure defined in [Section 8.3](#preStoC){.xref}. A DOTS
client that receives such notifications can then decide to send a
mitigation request if an attack cannot be mitigated locally within the
DOTS client domain.[¶](#section-4.1-5){.pilcrow}

Aggregate DOTS telemetry data can also be included in efficacy update
([Section 9.1](#effu-S){.xref}) or mitigation update ([Section

[Section

\[[RFC9132](#RFC9132){.xref}\] to control the size of a response when
the data to be returned does not fit within a single
datagram.[¶](#section-4.2-1){.pilcrow}

DOTS clients can also use the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)
Block1 Option in a PUT request ([Section
2.5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7959#section-2.5){.relref} of
\[[RFC7959](#RFC7959){.xref}\]) to initiate large transfers, but these
Block1 transfers are likely to fail if the inbound \"pipe\" is running
full because the transfer requires a message from the server for each
block, which would likely be lost in the incoming flood. Consideration
needs to be made to try to fit this PUT into a single transfer or to
separate out the PUT into several discrete PUTs where each of them fits
into a single packet.[¶](#section-4.2-2){.pilcrow}

This document specifies a YANG module \[[RFC7950](#RFC7950){.xref}\] for

The DOTS telemetry module ([Section 11.1](#module){.xref}) is not
intended to be used via the Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) /
RESTCONF for DOTS server management purposes. It serves only to provide
a data model and encoding following \[[RFC8791](#RFC8791){.xref}\].
Server deviations ([Section
5.6.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7950#section-5.6.3){.relref} of

DOTS agent does not have the means to retrieve the list of deviations
and thus interoperability issues are likely to be
encountered.[¶](#section-4.4-3){.pilcrow}

The DOTS telemetry module ([Section 11.1](#module){.xref}) uses
\"enumerations\" rather than \"identities\" to define units, samples,
and intervals because otherwise the namespace identifier
\"ietf-dots-telemetry\" must be included when a telemetry attribute is
included (e.g., in a mitigation efficacy update). The use of
\"identities\" is thus suboptimal from the standpoint of message
compactness, as message compactness is one of the key requirements for
DOTS signal channel messages.[¶](#section-4.4-4){.pilcrow}

The DOTS telemetry module ([Section 11.1](#module){.xref}) includes some
lists for which no \"key\" statement is included. This behavior is
compliant with \[[RFC8791](#RFC8791){.xref}\]. The reason for not
including these keys is that they are not included in the message body
of DOTS requests; such keys are included as mandatory Uri-Paths in
requests (Sections [7](#conf){.xref} and [8](#pre-t){.xref}). Otherwise,
whenever a \"key\" statement is used in the module, the same definition

DOTS telemetry uses several percentile values to provide a picture of a
traffic distribution overall, as opposed to just a single snapshot of
observed traffic at a single point in time. Modeling raw traffic flow
data as a distribution and describing that distribution entails choosing
a measurement period that the distribution will describe, and a number
of sampling intervals, or \"buckets\", within that measurement period.
Traffic within each bucket is treated as a single event (i.e.,
averaged), and then the distribution of buckets is used to describe the
distribution of traffic over the measurement period. A distribution can
be characterized by statistical measures (e.g., mean, median, and
standard deviation) and also by reporting the value of the distribution
at various percentile levels of the data set in question (e.g.,
\"quartiles\" that correspond to 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles). More
details about percentile values and their computation are found in
[Section
11.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2330#section-11.3){.relref} of
\[[RFC2330](#RFC2330){.xref}\].[¶](#section-7.1-1){.pilcrow}

DOTS telemetry uses up to three percentile values, plus the overall
peak, to characterize traffic distributions. Which percentile thresholds
are used for these \"low-percentile\", \"mid-percentile\", and
\"high-percentile\" values is configurable. Default values are defined
in [Section 7.1.2](#PUT){.xref}.[¶](#section-7.1-2){.pilcrow}

A DOTS client can negotiate with its server(s) a set of telemetry
configuration parameters to be used for telemetry. Such parameters
include:[¶](#section-7.1-3){.pilcrow}

-   [Percentile-related measurement parameters. In particular,
    \'measurement-interval\' defines the period during which percentiles

DOTS clients can also configure the unit class(es) to be used for
traffic-related telemetry data among the following supported unit
classes: packets per second, bits per second, and bytes per second.
Supplying both bits per second and bytes per second unit classes is
allowed for a given set of telemetry data. However, receipt of
conflicting values is treated as invalid parameters and rejected with a
4.00 (Bad Request) Response Code.[¶](#section-7.1.2-14){.pilcrow}

A DOTS client domain pipe is defined as a list of limits on (incoming)
traffic volume (\'total-pipe-capacity\') that can be forwarded over
ingress interconnection links of a DOTS client domain. Each of these
links is identified with a \'link-id\'
\[[RFC8345](#RFC8345){.xref}\].[¶](#section-7.2-3){.pilcrow}

The unit used by a DOTS client when conveying pipe information is
captured in the \'unit\' attribute. The DOTS client [MUST]{.bcp14}
auto-scale so that the appropriate unit is used. That is, for a given
unit class, the DOTS client uses the largest unit that gives a value
greater than one. As such, only one unit per unit class is
allowed.[¶](#section-7.2-4){.pilcrow}

Considerations similar to those specified in [Section
7.1.2](#PUT){.xref} are followed, with one
exception:[¶](#section-7.2.1-1){.pilcrow}

-   [The relative order of two PUT requests carrying DOTS client domain
    pipe attributes from a DOTS client is determined by comparing their
    respective \'tsid\' values. If these two requests have overlapping
    \'link-id\' and \'unit\' settings, the PUT request with a higher
    numeric \'tsid\' value will override the request with a lower
    numeric \'tsid\' value. The overlapped lower numeric \'tsid\'
    [MUST]{.bcp14} be automatically deleted and no longer be
    available.[¶](#section-7.2.1-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-7.2.1-2.1}

DOTS clients [SHOULD]{.bcp14} minimize the number of active \'tsid\'s
used for pipe information. In order to avoid maintaining a long list of
\'tsid\'s for pipe information, it is [RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14} that DOTS
clients include in any request to update information related to a given
link the information regarding other links (already communicated using a
lower \'tsid\' value). By doing so, this update request will override
these existing requests and hence optimize the number of \'tsid\'
requests per DOTS client.[¶](#section-7.2.1-3){.pilcrow}

Note: This assumes that all link information can fit in one single
message.[¶](#section-7.2.1-4.1){.pilcrow}

As an example of configuring pipe information, a DOTS client managing a
single-homed domain ([Figure 10](#single){.xref}) can send a PUT request
(shown in [Figure 11](#putp1){.xref}) to communicate the capacity of
\"link1\" used to connect to its ISP.[¶](#section-7.2.1-5){.pilcrow}

\'capacity\' attribute set to \"0\" if other links are still active for
the same DOTS client domain. For example, if a DOTS client domain

A DOTS client can share one or multiple normal traffic baselines (e.g.,
aggregate or per-prefix baselines); each is uniquely identified within
the DOTS client domain with an identifier (\'id\'). This identifier can
be used to update a baseline entry, delete a specific entry,
etc.[¶](#section-7.3-6){.pilcrow}

Considerations similar to those specified in [Section
7.1.2](#PUT){.xref} are followed, with one
exception:[¶](#section-7.3.1-1){.pilcrow}

-   [The relative order of two PUT requests carrying DOTS client domain
    baseline attributes from a DOTS client is determined by comparing
    their respective \'tsid\' values. If these two requests have
    overlapping targets, the PUT request with a higher numeric \'tsid\'
    value will override the request with a lower numeric \'tsid\' value.
    The overlapped lower numeric \'tsid\' [MUST]{.bcp14} be
    automatically deleted and no longer be
    available.[¶](#section-7.3.1-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-7.3.1-2.1}

Two PUT requests from a DOTS client have overlapping targets if there is
a common IP address, IP prefix, FQDN, URI, or alias name. Also, two PUT
requests from a DOTS client have overlapping targets from the
perspective of the DOTS server if the addresses associated with the
FQDN, URI, or alias are overlapping with each other or with
\'target-prefix\'.[¶](#section-7.3.1-3){.pilcrow}

DOTS clients [SHOULD]{.bcp14} minimize the number of active \'tsid\'s
used for baseline information. In order to avoid maintaining a long list
of \'tsid\'s for baseline information, it is [RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14} that
DOTS clients include in any request to update information related to a
given target the information regarding other targets (already
communicated using a lower \'tsid\' value) (assuming that this
information fits within one single datagram). This update request will
override these existing requests and hence optimize the number of
\'tsid\' requests per DOTS client.[¶](#section-7.3.1-4){.pilcrow}

If no target attribute is included in the request, this is an indication
that the baseline information applies for the DOTS client domain as a
whole.[¶](#section-7.3.1-5){.pilcrow}

An example of a PUT request to convey the baseline information is shown
in [Figure 19](#tputs){.xref}.[¶](#section-7.3.1-6){.pilcrow}

The pre-or-ongoing-mitigation telemetry attributes are indicated by the
path suffix \'/tm\'.  \'/tm\' is appended to the path prefix to form the
URI used with a CoAP request to signal the DOTS telemetry.
Pre-or-ongoing-mitigation telemetry attributes as specified in [Section
8.1](#pre){.xref} can be signaled between DOTS
agents.[¶](#section-8-4){.pilcrow}

Pre-or-ongoing-mitigation telemetry attributes may be sent by a DOTS
client or a DOTS server.[¶](#section-8-5){.pilcrow}

DOTS agents [SHOULD]{.bcp14} bind pre-or-ongoing-mitigation telemetry
data to mitigation requests associated with the resources under attack.
In particular, a telemetry PUT request sent after a mitigation request
may include a reference to that mitigation request (\'mid-list\') as
shown in [Figure 23](#mid-co){.xref}. An example illustrating request
correlation by means of \'target-prefix\' is shown in [Figure
24](#mid-co2){.xref}.[¶](#section-8-6){.pilcrow}

Much of the pre-or-ongoing-mitigation telemetry data uses a unit that
falls under the unit class that is configured following the procedure
described in [Section 7.1.2](#PUT){.xref}. When generating telemetry
data to send to a peer, the DOTS agent [MUST]{.bcp14} auto-scale so that
one or more appropriate units are used.[¶](#section-8-7){.pilcrow}

This attribute (depicted in [Figure 29](#adt){.xref}) is used to signal
a set of details characterizing an attack. The following sub-attributes
describing the ongoing attack can be signaled as attack
details:[¶](#section-8.1.5-1){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

vendor-id:
:   Vendor ID. This parameter represents a security vendor\'s enterprise
    number as registered in the IANA \"Private Enterprise Numbers\"
    registry
    \[[Private-Enterprise-Numbers](#Private-Enterprise-Numbers){.xref}\].[¶](#section-8.1.5-2.2){.pilcrow}
:   

attack-id:
:   Unique identifier assigned for the attack by a vendor. This
    parameter [MUST]{.bcp14} be present, independently of whether
    \'attack-description\' is included or
    not.[¶](#section-8.1.5-2.4){.pilcrow}
:   

description-lang:
:   Indicates the language tag that is used for the text that is
    included in the \'attack-description\' attribute. This attribute is
    encoded following the rules in [Section
    2.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5646#section-2.1){.relref} of
    \[[RFC5646](#RFC5646){.xref}\]. The default language tag is
    \"en-US\".[¶](#section-8.1.5-2.6){.pilcrow}
:   

attack-description:
:   Textual representation of the attack description. This description
    is related to the class of attack rather than a specific instance of
    it. Natural Language Processing techniques (e.g., word embedding)
    might provide some utility in mapping the attack description to an
    attack type. Textual representation of an attack solves two
    problems: it avoids the need to (a) create mapping tables manually
    between vendors and (b) standardize attack types that keep
    evolving.[¶](#section-8.1.5-2.8){.pilcrow}
:   

attack-severity:
:   Attack severity level. This attribute takes one of the values
    defined in [Section
    3.12.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7970#section-3.12.2){.relref}
    of \[[RFC7970](#RFC7970){.xref}\].[¶](#section-8.1.5-2.10){.pilcrow}
:   

start-time:
:   The time the attack started. The attack\'s start time is expressed
    in seconds relative to 1970-01-01T00:00Z ([Section
    3.4.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8949#section-3.4.2){.relref}
    of \[[RFC8949](#RFC8949){.xref}\]). The CBOR encoding is modified so
    that the leading tag 1 (epoch-based date/time) [MUST]{.bcp14} be
    omitted.[¶](#section-8.1.5-2.12){.pilcrow}
:   

end-time:
:   The time the attack ended. The attack\'s end time is expressed in
    seconds relative to 1970-01-01T00:00Z ([Section
    3.4.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8949#section-3.4.2){.relref}
    of \[[RFC8949](#RFC8949){.xref}\]). The CBOR encoding is modified so
    that the leading tag 1 (epoch-based date/time) [MUST]{.bcp14} be
    omitted.[¶](#section-8.1.5-2.14){.pilcrow}
:   

source-count:
:   A count of sources involved in the attack targeting the
    victim.[¶](#section-8.1.5-2.16){.pilcrow}
:   

top-talker:

:   A list of attack sources that are involved in an attack and that are
    generating an important part of the attack traffic. The top talkers
    are represented using
    \'source-prefix\'.[¶](#section-8.1.5-2.18.1){.pilcrow}

    \'spoofed-status\' indicates whether a top talker is a spoofed IP
    address (e.g., reflection attacks) or not. If no \'spoofed-status\'
    data node is included, this means that the spoofing status is
    unknown.[¶](#section-8.1.5-2.18.2){.pilcrow}

    If the target is being subjected to a bandwidth-consuming attack, a
    statistical profile of the attack traffic from each of the top
    talkers is included (\'total-attack-traffic\'; see [Section
    8.1.3](#tat){.xref}).[¶](#section-8.1.5-2.18.3){.pilcrow}

    If the target is being subjected to a resource-consuming DDoS
    attack, the same attributes as those defined in [Section
    8.1.4](#attackconn){.xref} are applicable for characterizing the
    attack on a per-talker basis.[¶](#section-8.1.5-2.18.4){.pilcrow}

In order to optimize the size of telemetry data conveyed over the DOTS
signal channel, DOTS agents [MAY]{.bcp14} use the DOTS data channel
\[[RFC8783](#RFC8783){.xref}\] to exchange vendor-specific attack
mapping details (that is, {vendor identifier, attack identifier} ==>
textual representation of the attack description). As such, DOTS agents
do not have to convey an attack description systematically in their
telemetry messages over the DOTS signal channel. Refer to [Section
8.1.6](#vam){.xref}.[¶](#section-8.1.5-4){.pilcrow}

#### [8.1.6.](#section-8.1.6){.section-number .selfRef} [Vendor Attack Mapping](#name-vendor-attack-mapping){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-vendor-attack-mapping}

Multiple mappings for different vendor identifiers may be used; the DOTS
agent transmitting telemetry information can elect to use one or more
vendor mappings even in the same telemetry
message.[¶](#section-8.1.6-1){.pilcrow}

Note: It is possible that a DOTS server is making use of multiple DOTS
mitigators, each from a different vendor. How telemetry information and
vendor mappings are exchanged between DOTS servers and DOTS mitigators
is outside the scope of this document.[¶](#section-8.1.6-2.1){.pilcrow}

DOTS clients and servers may be provided with mappings from different
vendors and so have their own different sets of vendor attack mappings.
A DOTS agent [MUST]{.bcp14} accept receipt of telemetry data with a
vendor identifier that is different than the identifier it uses to
transmit telemetry data. Furthermore, it is possible that the DOTS
client and DOTS server are provided by the same vendor but the vendor
mapping tables are at different revisions. The DOTS client
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} transmit telemetry information using any vendor
mapping(s) that it provided to the DOTS server (e.g., using a POST as
depicted in [Figure 30](#installmap){.xref}), and the DOTS server
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} use any vendor mappings(s) provided to the DOTS client
when transmitting telemetry data to the peer DOTS
agent.[¶](#section-8.1.6-3){.pilcrow}

The DOTS client repeats the above procedure regularly (e.g., once a
week) to update the DOTS server\'s vendor attack mapping
details.[¶](#section-8.1.6-13){.pilcrow}

If the DOTS client concludes that the DOTS server does not have any
reference to the specific vendor attack mapping details, the DOTS client
uses a POST request to install its vendor attack mapping details. An
example of such a POST request is depicted in [Figure
30](#installmap){.xref}.[¶](#section-8.1.6-14){.pilcrow}

The DOTS server indicates the result of processing the POST request
using the status-line. A \"201 Created\" status-line [MUST]{.bcp14} be
returned in the response if the DOTS server has accepted the vendor
attack mapping details. If the request is missing a mandatory attribute
or contains an invalid or unknown parameter, a \"400 Bad Request\"
status-line [MUST]{.bcp14} be returned by the DOTS server in the
response. The error-tag is set to \"missing-attribute\",
\"invalid-value\", or \"unknown-element\" as a function of the
encountered error.[¶](#section-8.1.6-15){.pilcrow}

If the request is received via a server-domain DOTS gateway but the DOTS
server does not maintain a \'cdid\' for this \'cuid\' while a \'cdid\'
is expected to be supplied, the DOTS server [MUST]{.bcp14} reply with a
\"403 Forbidden\" status-line and the error-tag \"access-denied\". Upon
receipt of this message, the DOTS client [MUST]{.bcp14} register

\[[RFC8783](#RFC8783){.xref}\]).[¶](#section-8.1.6-16){.pilcrow}

The DOTS client uses the PUT request to modify its vendor attack mapping
details maintained by the DOTS server (e.g., add a new mapping entry,
update an existing mapping).[¶](#section-8.1.6-17){.pilcrow}

A DOTS client uses a GET request to retrieve its vendor attack mapping

\'cuid\' is a mandatory Uri-Path parameter for DOTS PUT
requests.[¶](#section-8.2-3){.pilcrow}

The following additional Uri-Path parameter is
defined:[¶](#section-8.2-4){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

tmid:

:   The Telemetry Identifier is an identifier for the DOTS
    pre-or-ongoing-mitigation telemetry data represented as an integer.
    This identifier [MUST]{.bcp14} be generated by DOTS clients.
     \'tmid\' values [MUST]{.bcp14} increase monotonically whenever a
    DOTS client needs to convey a new set of pre-or-ongoing-mitigation
    telemetry data.[¶](#section-8.2-5.2.1){.pilcrow}

    The procedure specified in [Section
    4.4.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9132#section-4.4.1){.relref}
    of \[[RFC9132](#RFC9132){.xref}\] for \'mid\' rollover
    [MUST]{.bcp14} be followed for \'tmid\'
    rollover.[¶](#section-8.2-5.2.2){.pilcrow}

    This is a mandatory attribute.  \'tmid\' [MUST]{.bcp14} appear after
    \'cuid\' in the Uri-Path options.[¶](#section-8.2-5.2.3){.pilcrow}

:   

\'cuid\' and \'tmid\' [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} appear in the PUT request
message body.[¶](#section-8.2-6){.pilcrow}

At least the \'target\' attribute and another pre-or-ongoing-mitigation
attribute ([Section 8.1](#pre){.xref}) [MUST]{.bcp14} be present in the
PUT request. If only the \'target\' attribute is present, this request
is handled as per [Section
8.3](#preStoC){.xref}.[¶](#section-8.2-7){.pilcrow}

The relative order of two PUT requests carrying DOTS
pre-or-ongoing-mitigation telemetry from a DOTS client is determined by
comparing their respective \'tmid\' values. If these two requests have
an overlapping \'target\', the PUT request with a higher numeric
\'tmid\' value will override the request with a lower numeric \'tmid\'
value. The overlapped lower numeric \'tmid\' [MUST]{.bcp14} be
automatically deleted and no longer be
available.[¶](#section-8.2-8){.pilcrow}

The DOTS server indicates the result of processing a PUT request using
CoAP Response Codes. In particular, the 2.04 (Changed) Response Code is
returned if the DOTS server has accepted the pre-or-ongoing-mitigation
telemetry. The 5.03 (Service Unavailable) Response Code is returned if
the DOTS server has erred. The 5.03 Response Code uses the Max-Age
Option to indicate the number of seconds after which to
retry.[¶](#section-8.2-9){.pilcrow}

How long a DOTS server maintains a \'tmid\' as active or logs the
enclosed telemetry information is implementation specific. Note that if
a \'tmid\' is still active, then logging details are updated by the DOTS
server as a function of the updates received from the peer DOTS
client.[¶](#section-8.2-10){.pilcrow}

A DOTS client that lost the state of its active \'tmid\'s or has to set
\'tmid\' back to zero (e.g., crash or restart) [MUST]{.bcp14} send a GET
request to the DOTS server to retrieve the list of active \'tmid\'
values. The DOTS client may then delete \'tmid\'s that should not be
active anymore ([Figure 37](#spa){.xref}). Sending a DELETE with no
\'tmid\' indicates that all \'tmid\'s must be deactivated ([Figure
38](#dpa){.xref}).[¶](#section-8.2-11){.pilcrow}

The pre-or-ongoing-mitigation data (attack details in particular) can
also be signaled from DOTS servers to DOTS clients. For example, a DOTS
server co-located with a DDoS detector can collect monitoring
information from the target network, identify a DDoS attack using
statistical analysis or deep learning techniques, and signal the attack
details to the DOTS client.[¶](#section-8.3-1){.pilcrow}

The DOTS client can use the attack details to decide whether to trigger
a DOTS mitigation request or not. Furthermore, the security operations
personnel at the DOTS client domain can use the attack details to
determine the protection strategy and select the appropriate DOTS server
for mitigating the attack.[¶](#section-8.3-2){.pilcrow}

In order to receive pre-or-ongoing-mitigation telemetry notifications
from a DOTS server, a DOTS client [MUST]{.bcp14} send a PUT (followed by
a GET) with the target filter. An example of such a PUT request is shown
in [Figure 39](#put-tmid){.xref}. In order to avoid maintaining a long
list of such requests, it is [RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14} that DOTS clients
include all targets in the same request (assuming that this information
fits within one single datagram). DOTS servers may be instructed to
restrict the number of pre-or-ongoing-mitigation requests per DOTS
client domain. The pre-or-ongoing-mitigation requests [MUST]{.bcp14} be
maintained in an active state by the DOTS server until a DELETE request
is received from the same DOTS client to clear this
pre-or-ongoing-mitigation telemetry or when the DOTS client is
considered inactive (e.g., [Section
3.5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8783#section-3.5){.relref} of
\[[RFC8783](#RFC8783){.xref}\]).[¶](#section-8.3-3){.pilcrow}

The relative order of two PUT requests carrying DOTS
pre-or-ongoing-mitigation telemetry from a DOTS client is determined by

an overlapping \'target\', the PUT request with a higher numeric
\'tmid\' value will override the request with a lower numeric \'tmid\'

succeeded, the DOTS client issues a GET request to receive ongoing
telemetry updates. The client uses the Observe Option, set to \"0\"
(register), in the GET request to receive asynchronous notifications
carrying pre-or-ongoing-mitigation telemetry data from the DOTS server.

The DOTS client can use a filter to request a subset of the asynchronous
notifications from the DOTS server by indicating one or more Uri-Query
options in its GET request. A Uri-Query option can include the following
parameters to restrict the notifications based on the attack target:
\'target-prefix\', \'target-port\', \'target-protocol\',
\'target-fqdn\', \'target-uri\', \'alias-name\', \'mid\', and \'c\'
(content) ([Section 5.4](#control){.xref}).
Furthermore:[¶](#section-8.3-10){.pilcrow}

-   [If more than one Uri-Query option is included in a request, these
    options are interpreted in the same way as when multiple target

    spaces.[¶](#section-8.3-11.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-8.3-11.2}
-   [Range values (i.e., a contiguous inclusive block) can be included

-   [Wildcard names (i.e., a name with the leftmost label is the \"\*\"

    parameters. DOTS clients [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} include a name in which
    the \"\*\" character is included in a label other than the leftmost
    label. \"\*.example.com\" is an example of a valid wildcard name
    that can be included as a value of the \'target-fqdn\' parameter in
    a Uri-Query
    option.[¶](#section-8.3-11.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-8.3-11.4}

DOTS clients may also filter out the asynchronous notifications from the
DOTS server by indicating information about a specific attack source. To
that aim, a DOTS client may include \'source-prefix\', \'source-port\',
or \'source-icmp-type\' in a Uri-Query option. The same considerations
(ranges, multiple values) specified for target attributes apply for
source attributes. Special care [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be taken when using
these filters, as their use may cause some attacks to be hidden from the
requesting DOTS client (e.g., if the attack changes its source
information).[¶](#section-8.3-12){.pilcrow}

Requests with invalid query types (e.g., not supported, malformed)
received by the DOTS server [MUST]{.bcp14} be rejected with a 4.00 (Bad

Pre-or-Ongoing-Mitigation Telemetry Notification from the DOTS Server,
Depicted as per Section
5.6](#name-message-body-of-a-pre-or-on){.selfRef}
:::

A DOTS server sends the aggregate data for a target using the
\'total-attack-traffic\' attribute. The aggregate assumes that Uri-Query
filters are applied on the target. The DOTS server [MAY]{.bcp14} include
more fine-grained data when needed (that is,
\'total-attack-traffic-protocol\' and \'total-attack-traffic-port\'). If
a port filter (or protocol filter) is included in a request,
\'total-attack-traffic-protocol\' (or \'total-attack-traffic-port\')
conveys the data with the port (or protocol) filter
applied.[¶](#section-8.3-18){.pilcrow}

A DOTS server may aggregate pre-or-ongoing-mitigation data (e.g.,
\'top-talker\') for all targets of a domain or, when justified, send
specific information (e.g., \'top-talker\') for a specific
target.[¶](#section-8.3-19){.pilcrow}

The DOTS client may log pre-or-ongoing-mitigation telemetry data with an
alert sent to an administrator or a network controller. The DOTS client
may send a mitigation request if the attack cannot be handled
locally.[¶](#section-8.3-20){.pilcrow}

A DOTS client that is not interested in receiving
pre-or-ongoing-mitigation telemetry data for a target sends a DELETE
request similar to the DELETE request depicted in [Figure
37](#spa){.xref}.[¶](#section-8.3-21){.pilcrow}

In order to signal telemetry data in a mitigation efficacy update, it is
[RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14} that the DOTS client have already established a
DOTS telemetry setup session with the server in \'idle\' time. Such a
session is primarily meant to assess whether the peer DOTS server
supports telemetry extensions and to thus prevent message processing
failure ([Section

\[[RFC9132](#RFC9132){.xref}\]).[¶](#section-9.1-5){.pilcrow}

The mitigation status telemetry attributes can be signaled from the DOTS
server to the DOTS client as part of the periodic mitigation status
update ([Section
4.4.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9132#section-4.4.2){.relref} of
\[[RFC9132](#RFC9132){.xref}\]). In particular, DOTS clients can receive
asynchronous notifications of the attack details from DOTS servers using
the Observe Option defined in
\[[RFC7641](#RFC7641){.xref}\].[¶](#section-9.2-1){.pilcrow}

In order to make use of this feature, DOTS clients [MUST]{.bcp14}
establish a telemetry session with the DOTS server in \'idle\' time and
[MUST]{.bcp14} set the \'server-originated-telemetry\' attribute to
\'true\'.[¶](#section-9.2-2){.pilcrow}

DOTS servers [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} include telemetry attributes in
mitigation status updates sent to DOTS clients for telemetry sessions in
which the \'server-originated-telemetry\' attribute is set to
\'false\'.[¶](#section-9.2-3){.pilcrow}

As defined in \[[RFC8612](#RFC8612){.xref}\], the actual mitigation
activities can include several countermeasure mechanisms. The DOTS
server signals the current operational status of relevant
countermeasures. A list of attacks detected by these countermeasures
[MAY]{.bcp14} also be included. The same attributes as those defined in
[Section 8.1.5](#attackdetails){.xref} are applicable for describing the
attacks detected and mitigated at the DOTS server
domain.[¶](#section-9.2-4){.pilcrow}

The \"ietf-dots-telemetry\" YANG module ([Section 11.1](#module){.xref})
augments the \'mitigation-scope\' message type defined in the

### [14.1.](#section-14.1){.section-number .selfRef} [DOTS Signal Channel Telemetry](#name-dots-signal-channel-telemetr){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-dots-signal-channel-telemetr}

The security considerations for the DOTS signal channel protocol are
discussed in [Section
11](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9132#section-11){.relref} of
\[[RFC9132](#RFC9132){.xref}\]. The following discusses the security
considerations that are specific to the DOTS signal channel extension
defined in this document.[¶](#section-14.1-1){.pilcrow}

The DOTS telemetry information includes DOTS client network topology,
DOTS client domain pipe capacity, normal traffic baseline and connection
capacity, and threat and mitigation information. Such information is
sensitive; it [MUST]{.bcp14} be protected at rest by the DOTS server
domain to prevent data leakage. Note that sharing this sensitive data
with a trusted DOTS server does not introduce any new significant
considerations other than the need for the aforementioned protection.
Such a DOTS server is already trusted to have access to that kind of
information by being in the position to observe and mitigate
attacks.[¶](#section-14.1-2){.pilcrow}

DOTS clients are typically considered to be trusted devices by the DOTS
client domain. DOTS clients may be co-located on network security
services (e.g., firewall devices), and a compromised security service
potentially can do a lot more damage to the network than just the DOTS
client component. This assumption differs from the often-held view
(often referred to as the \"zero-trust model\") that devices are
untrusted. A compromised DOTS client can send fake DOTS telemetry data
to a DOTS server to mislead the DOTS server. This attack can be
prevented by monitoring and auditing DOTS clients to detect misbehavior
and to deter misuse, and by only authorizing the DOTS client to convey
DOTS telemetry information for specific target resources (e.g., an
application server is authorized to exchange DOTS telemetry for its IP
addresses but a DDoS mitigator can exchange DOTS telemetry for any
target resource in the network). As a reminder, this is a variation of
dealing with compromised DOTS clients as discussed in [Section
11](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9132#section-11){.relref} of
\[[RFC9132](#RFC9132){.xref}\].[¶](#section-14.1-3){.pilcrow}

DOTS servers must be capable of defending themselves against DoS attacks
from compromised DOTS clients. The following non-comprehensive list of
mitigation techniques can be used by a DOTS server to handle misbehaving
DOTS clients:[¶](#section-14.1-4){.pilcrow}

-   [The probing rate (defined in [Section
    4.5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9132#section-4.5){.relref} of
    \[[RFC9132](#RFC9132){.xref}\]) can be used to limit the average
    data rate to the DOTS
    server.[¶](#section-14.1-5.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-14.1-5.1}
-   [Rate-limiting DOTS telemetry, including packets with new \'tmid\'
    values from the same DOTS client, defends against DoS attacks that
    would result in varying the \'tmid\' to exhaust DOTS server
    resources. Likewise, the DOTS server can enforce a quota and time
    limit on the number of active pre-or-ongoing-mitigation telemetry
    data items (identified by \'tmid\') from the DOTS
    client.[¶](#section-14.1-5.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-14.1-5.2}

Note also that the telemetry notification interval may be used to
rate-limit the pre-or-ongoing-mitigation telemetry notifications
received by a DOTS client domain.[¶](#section-14.1-6){.pilcrow}

### [14.2.](#section-14.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Vendor Attack Mapping](#name-vendor-attack-mapping-2){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-vendor-attack-mapping-2}

The security considerations for the DOTS data channel protocol are
discussed in [Section
10](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8783#section-10){.relref} of
\[[RFC8783](#RFC8783){.xref}\]. The following discusses the security
considerations that are specific to the DOTS data channel extension
defined in this document.[¶](#section-14.2-1){.pilcrow}

All data nodes defined in the YANG module specified in [Section
11.2](#data){.xref} that can be created, modified, and deleted (i.e.,
config true, which is the default) are considered sensitive. Write
operations to these data nodes without proper protection can have a
negative effect on network operations. Appropriate security measures are
recommended to prevent illegitimate users from invoking DOTS data
channel primitives as discussed in \[[RFC8783](#RFC8783){.xref}\].
Nevertheless, an attacker who can access a DOTS client is technically
capable of undertaking various attacks, such
as:[¶](#section-14.2-2){.pilcrow}

-   [Communicating invalid attack mapping details to the server
    (\'/data-channel:dots-data/data-channel:dots-client/dots-telemetry:vendor-mapping\'),
    which will mislead the server when correlating attack
    details.[¶](#section-14.2-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-14.2-3.1}

Some of the readable data nodes in the YANG module specified in [Section
11.2](#data){.xref} may be considered sensitive. It is thus important to
control read access to these data nodes. These are the data nodes and
their sensitivity:[¶](#section-14.2-4){.pilcrow}

-   [\'/data-channel:dots-data/data-channel:dots-client/dots-telemetry:vendor-mapping\'
    can be misused to infer the DDoS protection technology deployed in a
    DOTS client
    domain.[¶](#section-14.2-5.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-14.2-5.1}
-   [\'/data-channel:dots-data/dots-telemetry:vendor-mapping\' can be
    used by a compromised DOTS client to leak the attack detection
    capabilities of the DOTS server. This is a variation of the
    compromised DOTS client attacks discussed in [Section
    14.1](#sec-cons-1){.xref}.[¶](#section-14.2-5.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-14.2-5.2}
