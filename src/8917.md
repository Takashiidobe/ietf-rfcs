# RFC 8917 {#rfcnum}

# The LoST-Validation Straightforward-Naming Authority PoinTeR (S-NAPTR) Application Service Tag {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

This document adds the \'LoST-Validation\' service tag to the
Straightforward-Naming Authority PoinTeR (S-NAPTR) Application Service
Tag IANA registry. This tag can appear in a Naming Authority Pointer
(NAPTR) Domain Name System (DNS) record to assist clients of the
Location-to-Service Translation (LoST) Protocol in identifying LoST
servers designated for location validation. This tag and the information
about its use update RFC 5222, which enables the explicit discovery of a
server that supports location
validation.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

This document adds \'LoST-Validation\' to the S-NAPTR Application
Service Tag IANA registry and describes how this tag fits in the LoST
server discovery procedure described in \[[RFC5222](#RFC5222){.xref}\].
This tag is used with Naming Authority Pointer (NAPTR) Domain Name
System (DNS) records so that clients of the Location-to-Service
Translation (LoST) Protocol \[[RFC5222](#RFC5222){.xref}\] can identify
servers designated for location validation. This tag and the information
on its use is an update to \[[RFC5222](#RFC5222){.xref}\] that enables
the explicit discovery of a server that supports location
validation.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}
:::

::: {#intro}
::: {#section-2 .section}
## [2.](#section-2){.section-number .selfRef} [Introduction](#name-introduction){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-introduction}

The LoST Protocol \[[RFC5222](#RFC5222){.xref}\] defines a mapping
service with the additional ability for a client to request that a civic
address be validated. The LoST protocol allows servers to ignore a
request to perform location validation. The National Emergency Number
Association (NENA) has defined an architecture for all-IP emergency
services (known as \"i3\" \[[NENA-i3](#NENA-i3){.xref}\]), which defines
the mapping (routing) and validation functions as two distinct
functional elements, defined as an Emergency Call Routing Function
(ECRF) and a Location Validation Function (LVF). NENA i3 requires that
the mapping (ECRF) and validation (LVF) functions be separable; an
entity responsible for a LoST server cluster can decide to provide
mapping and validation services using consolidated or separate server
clusters (i.e., using the same or separate boxes). The rationale is that
the mapping service is used in real time during emergency call routing,
while the validation service is used in advance, typically when data is
provisioned; therefore, the mapping service has much higher availability
and response-time requirements than the validation service. An
organization might choose to deploy these services using different
server clusters to make it easier to provide higher levels of service
for the mapping function while shielding it from the potentially bursty
load of validation. Another organization might choose to use the same
sets of servers for both services, configured and deployed to offer the
high service level demanded of the mapping
service.[¶](#section-2-1){.pilcrow}

In order to permit this separability, any entity querying a LoST server
needs to be able to resolve an Application Unique String (AUS) into a
URL for a LoST server designated for the required service (mapping or
validation). This separability needs to be maintained throughout the
LoST tree structure, from forest guide to leaf node (LoST architecture
is described in \[[RFC5582](#RFC5582){.xref}\]). Because LoST referrals
return an AUS rather than a URL, either a different service tag or a DNS
name convention (e.g., \"ecrf.example.org\" and \"lvf.example.org\") is
needed to differentiate between the services. DNS name conventions are
inflexible and fragile, making a different service tag the preferred
approach.[¶](#section-2-2){.pilcrow}

Because LoST servers may ignore a request to perform location
validation, a service tag explicitly for location validation also
reduces the likelihood (which has existed since
\[[RFC5582](#RFC5582){.xref}\]) that a client needing location
validation will reach servers that are not doing so (due to
configuration and/or conditions).[¶](#section-2-3){.pilcrow}

## [3.](#section-3){.section-number .selfRef} [The LoST-Validation Application Service Tag](#name-the-lost-validation-applica){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-the-lost-validation-applica}

This document adds \'LoST-Validation\' to the \"S-NAPTR Application
Service Tags\" registry created by \[[RFC3958](#RFC3958){.xref}\]. The
\'LoST-Validation\' tag serves as a counterpart to the \'LoST\' tag
added by \[[RFC5222](#RFC5222){.xref}\]: the \'LoST\' tag identifies
servers able to perform the core mapping function, while
\'LoST-Validation\' identifies servers designated for the validation
function.[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

Because some servers might be configured to provide both mapping and
validation functions, a server identified using the \'LoST\' service tag
might also perform the validation function (and resolving the two tags
might result in the same URL). Because the two functions might be
separate, clients seeking a LoST server for location validation can
first try a URI-Enabled NAPTR (U-NAPTR) resolution using the
\'LoST-Validation\' service tag and can fall back to the \'LoST\'
service tag if this does not resolve to a usable LoST
server.[¶](#section-3-2){.pilcrow}

LoST \[[RFC5222](#RFC5222){.xref}\] specifies that LoST servers are
located by resolving an AUS using U-NAPTR/DDDS (URI-Enabled NAPTR /
Dynamic Delegation Discovery Service) \[[RFC4848](#RFC4848){.xref}\] and
defines the \'LoST\' application service tag. In order to permit
separability of the mapping and validation services performed using
LoST, this document defines the \'LoST-Validation\' service tag. This
tag also reduces the likelihood that a client needing location
validation might reach servers that are not performing validation (due
to configuration and/or conditions). NAPTR records for LoST servers
available for location validation contain the \'LoST-Validation\'
service tag. An entity needing to perform location validation using LoST
performs the discovery procedure as described in
\[[RFC5222](#RFC5222){.xref}\], except that the \'LoST-Validation\'
service tag is used in preference to the \'LoST\' service tag. For both
service tags, the HTTP and HTTPS URL schemes are used. In the absence of
any NAPTR records containing the \'LoST-Validation\' service tag, the
\'LoST\' service tag is used. Fallback to the \'LoST\' service tag may
follow if the \'LoST-Validation\' service tag fails to result in a
usable LoST server. The discovery procedure with the \'LoST-Validation\'
service tag might result in the same URL as the \'LoST\' service tag, or
it may result in a different URL. When the URLs are different, they
could lead to the same physical servers or different
servers.[¶](#section-3-3){.pilcrow}

## [4.](#section-4){.section-number .selfRef} [Backwards Compatibility](#name-backwards-compatibility){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-backwards-compatibility}

The primary use of LoST in general, and the location validation
functionality in particular, is within the emergency services area.
Within North America, the NENA i3 \[[NENA-i3](#NENA-i3){.xref}\]
document specifies how protocols including LoST are used. The i3
document is expected to reference the \'LoST-Validation\' service tag
and specify its use in both server NAPTR DNS records and client
resolution of AUS.[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

LoST allows a server to refuse to perform location validation and
defines the \'locationValidationUnavailable\' warning. LoST also allows
a server to refer to another server rather than answering itself. So, in
a deployment where a LoST tree has separate server clusters for mapping
and for validation, mapping servers receiving a request for validation
could either perform the validation as requested or return the
\'locationValidationUnavailable\' warning and potentially also include a
\<redirect> element to redirect to a validation server. However, the
\<redirect> element contains an AUS, so unless the AUSs for validation
and mapping are different (e.g., \'ecrf.example.org\' and
\'lvf.example.org\'), we still need a different service tag to allow for
flexible deployment choices (i.e., not requiring a DNS name
convention).[¶](#section-4-2){.pilcrow}

LoST clients performing emergency services operations in North America
are expected to comply with the NENA i3 specification and hence support
the \'LoST-Validation\' service tag when defined. A LoST client
implemented prior to the addition of the \'LoST-Validation\' tag would
use the \'LoST\' tag to resolve an AUS. Such a client might not be
performing location validation, but if it is, the LoST server it
contacts may perform the service. Even in a deployment where mapping and
validation are split, the data is identical; the split is a load and
deployment optimization strategy. Servers designated for mapping might
perform validation when requested (potentially depending on load or
other factors). If an older client attempts validation using a
designated mapping server that refuses the request, the client will
retry later, at which point the server might provide the function (e.g.,
if its load or other conditions have changed). Even in the case of a
designated mapping server that refuses to perform validation at any
time, the server could return a redirect with a different AUS (e.g.,
\"lvf.example.com\") that resolves to a designated validation server. In
the worst case, the client will be unable to reach a server willing to
perform validation and will follow up (e.g., submit a discrepancy report
as specified in NENA i3). The resolution may be to update the client
with the \'LoST-Validation\' service tag, update the AUS returned in a
redirect and DNS to use a different DNS host name, or permit the server
to perform validation when not under stress (or a combination). Note
that, because LoST does not require servers to perform validation, the
situation described can exist regardless of the addition of the
\'LoST-Validation\' service tag. Use of the tag improves the likelihood
that a client is able to validate a location when
needed.[¶](#section-4-3){.pilcrow}

## [5.](#section-5){.section-number .selfRef} [Security Considerations](#name-security-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-security-considerations}

The security considerations described in \[[RFC3958](#RFC3958){.xref}\],
\[[RFC4848](#RFC4848){.xref}\], and \[[RFC5222](#RFC5222){.xref}\] apply
here. No additional security aspects are foreseen by the addition of an
extra tag. Separation of services might be desired, for example, to be
able to allocate different levels of resources (such as server capacity,
attack mitigation, bandwidth, etc.) to the mapping and validation
services, in which case separate tags are needed to allow LoST clients
(which may include other LoST servers) to identify the correct server
cluster.[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC5222](#RFC5222){.xref}\] descriptively discusses the use of DNS
security \[[RFC4033](#RFC4033){.xref}\] to mitigate the risk of
DNS-based attacks. Because DNS security has become more widely deployed
since the publication of \[[RFC5222](#RFC5222){.xref}\], such measures
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} be used when performing NAPTR resolution. Note that,
while there are valid reasons to proceed with a LoST mapping query
despite security failures while initiating or processing an emergency
call, these concerns generally do not apply to a LoST validation query
done in advance of an emergency call.[¶](#section-5-2){.pilcrow}
