Computing paths across large multi-domain environments may require
special computational components and cooperation between entities in
different domains capable of complex path
computation.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

Issues that may exist when routing in multi-domain networks include the
following:[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

-   [There is often a lack of full topology and TE information across
    domains.[¶](#section-1-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-3.1}
-   [No single node has the full visibility to determine an optimal or
    even feasible end-to-end path across
    domains.[¶](#section-1-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-3.2}
-   [Knowing how to evaluate and select the exit point and next domain
    boundary from a
    domain.[¶](#section-1-3.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-3.3}
-   [Understanding how the ingress node determines which domains should
    be used for the end-to-end
    path.[¶](#section-1-3.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-3.4}

An information exchange across multiple domains is often limited due to
the lack of trust relationship, security issues, or scalability issues,
even if there is a trust relationship between
domains.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

The Path Computation Element (PCE) \[[RFC4655](#RFC4655){.xref}\]
provides an architecture and a set of functional components to address
the problem space and the issues highlighted
above.[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}

A PCE may be used to compute end-to-end paths across multi-domain
environments using a per-domain path computation technique
\[[RFC5152](#RFC5152){.xref}\]. The so-called backward recursive
PCE-based computation (BRPC) mechanism \[[RFC5441](#RFC5441){.xref}\]
defines a path computation procedure to compute inter-domain constrained
Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS)
Traffic-Engineered (TE) networks. However, both per-domain and BRPC
techniques assume that the sequence of domains to be crossed from source
to destination is known, either fixed by the network operator or
obtained by other means.[¶](#section-1-6){.pilcrow}

In more advanced deployments (including multi-area and multi-Autonomous
System (multi-AS) environments), the sequence of domains may not be
known in advance, and the choice of domains in the end-to-end domain
sequence might be critical to the determination of an optimal end-to-end
path. In this case, the use of the hierarchical PCE
\[[RFC6805](#RFC6805){.xref}\] architecture and mechanisms may be used
to discover the intra-area path and select the optimal end-to-end domain
sequence.[¶](#section-1-7){.pilcrow}

This document describes the processes and procedures available when
using the PCE architecture and protocols for computing inter-area and
inter-AS MPLS and GMPLS Traffic-Engineered
paths.[¶](#section-1-8){.pilcrow}

The scope of this document does not include discussions of deployment
scenarios for stateful PCE, active PCE, remotely initiated PCE, or PCE
as a central controller (PCECC).[¶](#section-1-9){.pilcrow}

### [1.1.](#section-1.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Domains](#name-domains){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-domains}

Generally, a domain can be defined as a separate administrative,
geographic, or switching environment within the network. A domain may be
further defined as a zone of routing or computational ability. Under
these definitions, a domain might be categorized as an Autonomous System
(AS) or an Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) area (as per
\[[RFC4726](#RFC4726){.xref}\] and
\[[RFC4655](#RFC4655){.xref}\]).[¶](#section-1.1-1){.pilcrow}

For the purposes of this document, a domain is considered to be a
collection of network elements within an area or AS that has a common
sphere of address management or path computational responsibility.
Wholly or partially overlapping domains are not within the scope of this
document.[¶](#section-1.1-2){.pilcrow}

In the context of GMPLS, a particularly important example of a domain is
the Automatically Switched Optical Network (ASON) subnetwork
\[[G-8080](#G-8080){.xref}\]. In this case, computation of an end-to-end
path requires the selection of nodes and links within a parent domain
where some nodes may, in fact, be subnetworks. Furthermore, a domain
might be an ASON routing area \[[G-7715](#G-7715){.xref}\]. A PCE may

### [1.2.](#section-1.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Path Computation](#name-path-computation){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-path-computation}

For the purpose of this document, it is assumed that path computation is
the sole responsibility of the PCE as per the architecture defined in
\[[RFC4655](#RFC4655){.xref}\]. When a path is required, the Path
Computation Client (PCC) will send a request to the PCE. The PCE will
apply the required constraints, compute a path, and return a response to
the PCC. In the context of this document, it may be necessary for the
PCE to cooperate with other PCEs in adjacent domains (as per BRPC
\[[RFC5441](#RFC5441){.xref}\]) or with a parent PCE (as per
\[[RFC6805](#RFC6805){.xref}\]).[¶](#section-1.2-1){.pilcrow}

It is entirely feasible that an operator could compute a path across
multiple domains without the use of a PCE if the relevant domain
information is available to the network planner or network management
platform. The definition of what relevant information is required to
perform this network planning operation and how that information is
discovered and applied is outside the scope of this
document.[¶](#section-1.2-2){.pilcrow}

As highlighted, the PCE is an entity capable of computing an
inter-domain TE path upon receiving a request from a PCC. There could be
a single PCE per domain or a single PCE responsible for all domains. A
PCE may or may not reside on the same node as the requesting PCC. A path
may be computed by either a single PCE node or a set of distributed PCE
nodes that collaborate during path
computation.[¶](#section-1.2.1-1){.pilcrow}

According to \[[RFC4655](#RFC4655){.xref}\], a PCC should send a path
computation request to a particular PCE using
\[[RFC5440](#RFC5440){.xref}\] (PCC-to-PCE communication). This negates
the need to broadcast a request to all the PCEs. Each PCC can maintain
information about the computation capabilities of the PCEs it is aware
of. The PCC-PCE capability awareness can be configured using static
configurations or by automatic and dynamic PCE discovery
procedures.[¶](#section-1.2.1-2){.pilcrow}

If a network path is required, the PCC will send a path computation
request to the PCE. A PCE may then compute the end-to-end path if it is
aware of the topology and TE information required to compute the entire
path. If the PCE is unable to compute the entire path, the PCE
architecture provides cooperative PCE mechanisms for the resolution of
path computation requests when an individual PCE does not have
sufficient TE visibility.[¶](#section-1.2.1-3){.pilcrow}

End-to-end path segments may be kept confidential through the
application of Path-Keys to protect partial or full path information. A
Path-Key is a token that replaces a path segment in an explicit route.
The Path-Key mechanism is described in
\[[RFC5520](#RFC5520){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1.2.1-4){.pilcrow}

As networks increase in size and complexity, it may be required to
introduce scaling methods to reduce the amount of information flooded
within the network and make the network more manageable. An IGP
hierarchy is designed to improve IGP scalability by dividing the IGP
domain into areas and limiting the flooding scope of topology
information to within area boundaries. This restricts visibility of the
area to routers in a single area. If a router needs to compute the route
to a destination located in another area, a method would be required to
compute a path across area boundaries.[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

In order to support multiple vendors in a network in cases where data or
control-plane technologies cannot interoperate, it is useful to divide
the network into vendor domains. Each vendor domain is an IGP area, and
the flooding scope of the topology (as well as any other relevant
information) is limited to the area
boundaries.[¶](#section-5-2){.pilcrow}

Per-domain path computation \[[RFC5152](#RFC5152){.xref}\] exists to
provide a method of inter-area path computation. The per-domain solution
is based on loose hop routing with an Explicit Route Object (ERO)
expansion on each Area Border Router (ABR). This allows an LSP to be
established using a constrained path. However, at least two issues
exist:[¶](#section-5-3){.pilcrow}

-   [This method does not guarantee an optimal constrained

protection.[¶](#section-6.3-1){.pilcrow}

Other inter-AS recovery mechanisms include
\[[RFC4090](#RFC4090){.xref}\], which adds Fast Reroute (FRR) protection
to an LSP. So, the PCE could be used to trigger computation of backup
tunnels in order to protect inter-AS
connectivity.[¶](#section-6.3-2){.pilcrow}

Inter-AS recovery clearly requires backup LSPs for service protection,
but it would also be advisable to have multiple PCEs deployed for path
computation redundancy, especially for service restoration in the event
of catastrophic network failure.[¶](#section-6.3-3){.pilcrow}

An optimal path computation requires knowledge of the available network
resources, including nodes and links, constraints, link connectivity,
available bandwidth, and link costs. The PCE operates on a view of the
network topology as presented by a TED. As discussed in
\[[RFC4655](#RFC4655){.xref}\], the TED used by a PCE may be learned by
the relevant IGP extensions.[¶](#section-7.1-1){.pilcrow}

Thus, the PCE may operate its TED by participating in the IGP running in
the network. In an MPLS-TE network, this would require OSPF-TE
\[[RFC3630](#RFC3630){.xref}\] or ISIS-TE
\[[RFC5305](#RFC5305){.xref}\]. In a GMPLS network, it would utilize the
GMPLS extensions to OSPF and IS-IS defined in

The concept of the exchange of TE information between Autonomous Systems

exchanged in this way could be the full TE information from the AS, an
aggregation of that information, or a representation of the potential

In an H-PCE deployment, the parent PCE will require the inter-domain
topology and link status between child domains. This information may be
learned by a BGP-LS speaker and provided to the parent PCE. Furthermore,
link-state performance, including delay, available bandwidth, and

Offline path computation is performed ahead of time before the LSP setup
is requested. That means that it is requested by or performed as part of
an Operation Support System (OSS) management application. This model can
be seen in [Section
5.5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4655#section-5.5){.relref} of
\[[RFC4655](#RFC4655){.xref}\].[¶](#section-7.2-1){.pilcrow}

The offline model is particularly appropriate for long-lived LSPs (such
as those present in a transport network) or for planned responses to
network failures. In these scenarios, more planning is normally a
feature of LSP provisioning.[¶](#section-7.2-2){.pilcrow}

The management system may also use a PCE and BRPC to pre-plan an AS
sequence, and the source domain PCE and per-domain path computation to
be used when the actual end-to-end path is required. This model may also
be used where the operator wishes to retain full manual control of the
placement of LSPs, using the PCE only as a computation tool to assist
the operator and not as part of an automated
network.[¶](#section-7.2-3){.pilcrow}

In environments where operators peer with each other to provide
end-to-end paths, the operator responsible for each domain must agree on
the extent to which paths must be pre-planned or manually
controlled.[¶](#section-7.2-4){.pilcrow}

This section discusses the techniques that cooperating PCEs can use to
compute inter-domain paths without each domain disclosing sensitive
internal topology information (such as explicit nodes or links within
the domain) to the other domains.[¶](#section-8-1){.pilcrow}

Confidentiality typically applies to inter-provider (inter-AS) PCE
communication. Where the TE LSP crosses multiple domains (ASes or
areas), the path may be computed by multiple PCEs that cooperate
together, with each local PCE responsible for computing a segment of the
path. With each local PCE responsible for computing a segment of the
path.[¶](#section-8-2){.pilcrow}

In situations where ASes are administered by separate Service Providers,
it would break confidentiality rules for a PCE to supply path segment
details to a PCE responsible for another domain, thus disclosing
AS-internal or area topology information.[¶](#section-8-3){.pilcrow}

A method for preserving the confidentiality of the path segment is for

that must be kept confidential. The concept of loose and strict hops for
the route of a TE LSP is described in
\[[RFC3209](#RFC3209){.xref}\].[¶](#section-8.1-1){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC5440](#RFC5440){.xref}\] supports the use of paths with loose
hops; whether it returns a full explicit path with strict hops or uses
loose hops is a local policy decision at a PCE. A path computation
request may require an explicit path with strict hops or may allow loose
hops, as detailed in

The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) defines the ASON
architecture in \[[G-8080](#G-8080){.xref}\].
\[[G-7715](#G-7715){.xref}\] defines the routing architecture for ASON
and introduces a hierarchical architecture. In this architecture, the
Routing Areas (RAs) have a hierarchical relationship between different
routing levels, which means a parent (or higher level) RA can contain
multiple child RAs. The interconnectivity of the lower RAs is visible to
the higher-level RA.[¶](#section-10-1){.pilcrow}

In the ASON framework, a path computation request is termed a route
query. This query is executed before signaling is used to establish an
LSP, which is termed a Switched Connection (SC) or a Soft Permanent
Connection (SPC). \[[G-7715-2](#G-7715-2){.xref}\] defines the
requirements and architecture for the functions performed by Routing
Controllers (RC) during the operation of remote route queries. An RC is
synonymous with a PCE.[¶](#section-10-2){.pilcrow}

In the ASON routing environment, an RC responsible for an RA may
communicate with its neighbor RC to request the computation of an
end-to-end path across several RAs. The path computation components and
sequences are defined as follows:[¶](#section-10-3){.pilcrow}

-   [Remote route query. An operation where a Routing Controller
    communicates with another Routing Controller, which does not have
    the same set of layer resources, in order to compute a routing path
    in a collaborative
    manner.[¶](#section-10-4.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-10-4.1}
-   [Route query requester. The connection controller or RC that sends a
    route query message to a Routing Controller that requests one or
    more routing paths satisfying a set of routing
    constraints.[¶](#section-10-4.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-10-4.2}
-   [Route query responder. An RC that performs the path computation
    upon reception of a route query message from a Routing Controller or
    connection controller, and sends a response back at the end of the
    computation.[¶](#section-10-4.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-10-4.3}

When computing an end-to-end connection, the route may be computed by a
single RC or multiple RCs in a collaborative manner, and the two
scenarios can be considered a centralized remote route query model and a
distributed remote route query model. RCs in an ASON environment can
also use the hierarchical PCE \[[RFC6805](#RFC6805){.xref}\] model to
fully match the ASON hierarchical routing
model.[¶](#section-10-5){.pilcrow}
