# RFC 9280 {#rfcnum}

# RFC Editor Model (Version 3) {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

This document specifies version 3 of the RFC Editor Model. The model
defines two high-level tasks related to the RFC Series. First, policy
definition is the joint responsibility of the RFC Series Working Group
(RSWG), which produces policy proposals, and the RFC Series Approval
Board (RSAB), which approves such proposals. Second, policy
implementation is primarily the responsibility of the RFC Production
Center (RPC) as contractually overseen by the IETF Administration
Limited Liability Company (IETF LLC). In addition, various
responsibilities of the RFC Editor function are now performed alone or
in combination by the RSWG, RSAB, RPC, RFC Series Consulting Editor
(RSCE), and IETF LLC. Finally, this document establishes the Editorial
Stream for publication of future policy definition documents produced
through the processes defined herein.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

This document obsoletes RFC 8728. This document updates RFCs 7841, 8729,
and 8730.[¶](#section-abstract-2){.pilcrow}

The Request for Comments (RFC) Series is the archival series dedicated
to documenting Internet technical specifications, including general
contributions from the Internet research and engineering community as
well as standards documents. RFCs are available free of charge to anyone
via the Internet. As described in \[[RFC8700](#RFC8700){.xref}\], RFCs
have been published continually since 1969.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

RFCs are generated and approved by multiple document streams. Whereas
the stream approving body \[[RFC8729](#RFC8729){.xref}\] for each stream
is responsible for the content of that stream, the RFC Editor function
is responsible for the production and distribution of all RFCs. The four
existing streams are described in \[[RFC8729](#RFC8729){.xref}\]. This
document adds a fifth stream, the Editorial Stream, for publication of
policies governing the RFC Series as a whole.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

The overall framework for the RFC Series and the RFC Editor function is
described in \[[RFC8729](#RFC8729){.xref}\] and is updated by this
document, which defines version 3 of the RFC Editor Model. Under this
version, various responsibilities of the RFC Editor function are
performed alone or in combination by the RFC Series Working Group
(RSWG), RFC Series Advisory Board (RSAB), RFC Production Center (RPC),
RFC Series Consulting Editor (RSCE), and IETF Administration Limited
Liability Company (IETF LLC) \[[RFC8711](#RFC8711){.xref}\], which
collectively comprise the RFC Editor function. The intent is to ensure
sustainable maintenance and support of the RFC Series based on the
principles of expert implementation, clear management and direction, and
appropriate community input
\[[RFC8729](#RFC8729){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

This document obsoletes \[[RFC8728](#RFC8728){.xref}\] by defining
version 3 of the RFC Editor Model. This document updates
\[[RFC7841](#RFC7841){.xref}\] by defining boilerplate text for the
Editorial Stream. This document updates \[[RFC8729](#RFC8729){.xref}\]
by replacing the RFC Editor role with the RSWG, RSAB, and RSCE. This
document updates \[[RFC8730](#RFC8730){.xref}\] by removing the
dependency on certain policies specified by the IAB and RFC Series
Editor (RSE). More detailed information about changes from version 2 of
the RFC Editor Model can be found in [Section
9](#changes){.xref}.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

This document divides the responsibilities for the RFC Series into two
high-level tasks:[¶](#section-2-1){.pilcrow}

1.  [Policy definition governing the RFC Series as a whole. This is the
    joint responsibility of two entities. First, the RFC Series Working
    Group (RSWG) is an open working group independent of the IETF that
    generates policy proposals. Second, the RFC Series Approval Board
    (RSAB) is an appointed body that approves such proposals for
    publication in the Editorial Stream. The RSAB includes
    representatives of the streams \[[RFC8729](#RFC8729){.xref}\] as
    well as an expert in technical publishing, the RFC Series Consulting
    Editor (RSCE).[¶](#section-2-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-2-2.1}
2.  [Policy implementation through publication of RFCs in all of the
    streams that form the RFC Series. This is primarily the
    responsibility of the RFC Production Center (RPC) as contractually
    overseen by the IETF Administration Limited Liability Company (IETF
    LLC)
    \[[RFC8711](#RFC8711){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-2-2.2}

As described more fully in the remainder of this document, the core
activities and responsibilities are as
follows:[¶](#section-2-3){.pilcrow}

-   [The RSWG proposes policies that govern the RFC Series as a whole,
    with input from the community, the RSAB, and the
    RSCE.[¶](#section-2-4.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-2-4.1}
-   [The RSAB considers those proposals and either approves them or
    returns them to the RSWG, which may make further changes or remove
    them from further
    consideration.[¶](#section-2-4.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-2-4.2}
-   [If approved, such proposals are published as RFCs in the Editorial
    Stream and thus define the policies to be followed by the RSWG,
    RSAB, RSCE, and RPC.[¶](#section-2-4.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-2-4.3}
-   [The RSCE provides expert advice to the RPC and RSAB on how to
    implement established policies on an ongoing and operational basis,
    which can include raising issues or initiating proposed policy
    changes within the
    RSWG.[¶](#section-2-4.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-2-4.4}
-   [The RPC implements the policies defined by the Editorial Stream in
    its day-to-day editing and publication of RFCs from all of the
    streams.[¶](#section-2-4.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-2-4.5}
-   [If issues arise with the implementation of particular policies, the
    RPC brings those issues to the RSAB, which interprets the policies
    and provides interim guidance to the RPC, informing the RSWG of
    those interpretations.[¶](#section-2-4.6){.pilcrow}]{#section-2-4.6}

This model is designed to ensure public processes and policy documents,
clear lines of responsibility and authority, transparent mechanisms for
updates and changes to policies governing the RFC Series as a whole, and
effective operational implementation of the RFC Series, thus meeting the
requirements specified in [Section
4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8729#section-4){.relref} of
\[[RFC8729](#RFC8729){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2-5){.pilcrow}

## [3.](#section-3){.section-number .selfRef} [Policy Definition](#name-policy-definition){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-policy-definition}

Policies governing the RFC Series as a whole are defined through the
following high-level process:[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

1.  [Proposals must be submitted to, adopted by, and discussed within
    the RFC Series Working Group
    (RSWG).[¶](#section-3-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-2.1}
2.  [Proposals must pass a Last Call for comments in the working group
    and a community call for comments (see [Section
    3.2.3](#cfc){.xref}).[¶](#section-3-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-2.2}
3.  [Proposals must be approved by the RFC Series Approval Board
    (RSAB).[¶](#section-3-2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-2.3}

Policies under the purview of the RSWG and RSAB might include, but are
not limited to, document formats, processes for publication and
dissemination of RFCs, and overall management of the RFC
Series.[¶](#section-3-3){.pilcrow}

The RSWG shall have two chairs, one appointed by the IESG and the other
appointed by the IAB. When the RSWG is formed, the chair appointed by
the IESG shall serve for a term of one (1) year and the chair appointed
by the IAB shall serve for a term of two (2) years; thereafter, chairs
shall serve for a term of two (2) years, with no term limits on renewal.
The IESG and IAB shall determine their own processes for making these
appointments, making sure to take account of any potential conflicts of
interest. Community members who have concerns about the performance of
an RSWG Chair should direct their feedback to the appropriate appointing
body via mechanisms such bodies shall specify at the time that the RSWG
is formed. The IESG and IAB shall have the power to remove their
appointed chairs at their discretion at any time and to name a
replacement who shall serve the remainder of the original chair\'s
term.[¶](#section-3.1.1.3-1){.pilcrow}

It is the responsibility of the chairs to encourage rough consensus
within the RSWG and to follow that consensus in their decision making,

The intent is that the RSWG shall operate in a way similar to that of
working groups in the IETF. Therefore, all RSWG meetings and discussion
venues shall be open to all interested individuals, and all RSWG
contributions shall be subject to intellectual property policies, which
must be consistent with those of the IETF as specified in
\[[BCP78](#BCP78){.xref}\] and

archived.[¶](#section-3.1.1.4-2){.pilcrow}

The RSWG is empowered to hold in-person, online-only, or hybrid
meetings, which should be announced with sufficient notice to enable
broad participation; the [IESG Guidance on Face-to-Face and Virtual
Interim
Meetings](https://www.ietf.org/about/groups/iesg/statements/interim-meetings-guidance-2016-01-16/)
provides a reasonable baseline. In-person meetings should include
provision for effective online participation for those unable to attend
in person.[¶](#section-3.1.1.4-3){.pilcrow}

The RSWG shall operate by rough consensus, a mode of operation
informally described in
\[[RFC2418](#RFC2418){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3.1.1.4-4){.pilcrow}

The RSWG may decide by rough consensus to use additional tooling (e.g.,
GitHub as specified in \[[RFC8874](#RFC8874){.xref}\]), forms of
communication, and working methods (e.g., design teams) as long as they
are consistent with this document and with
\[[RFC2418](#RFC2418){.xref}\] or its

the RSAB is to review policy proposals generated by the RSWG; it shall
have no independent authority to formulate policy on its own. It is
expected that the RSAB will respect the rough consensus of the RSWG

#### [3.2.1.](#section-3.2.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Intent](#name-intent){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-intent}

The intent is to provide an open forum by which policies related to the
RFC Series are defined and evolved. The general expectation is that all
interested parties will participate in the RSWG and that only under
extreme circumstances should RSAB members need to hold CONCERN positions
(as described in [Section
3.2.2](#workflow){.xref}).[¶](#section-3.2.1-1){.pilcrow}

Because policy issues can be difficult and contentious, RSWG
participants and RSAB members are strongly encouraged to work together
in a spirit of good faith and mutual understanding to achieve rough
consensus (see \[[RFC2418](#RFC2418){.xref}\]). In particular, RSWG
members are encouraged to take RSAB concerns seriously, and RSAB members
are encouraged to clearly express their concerns early in the process
and to be responsive to the community. All parties are encouraged to
respect the value of each stream and the long-term health and viability
of the RFC Series.[¶](#section-3.2.1-2){.pilcrow}

This process is intended to be one of continuous consultation. RSAB
members should consult with their constituent stakeholders (e.g.,
authors, editors, tool developers, and consumers of RFCs) on an ongoing
basis, so that when the time comes to consider the approval of a
proposal, there should be no surprises. Appointing bodies are expected
to establish whatever processes they deem appropriate to facilitate this
goal.[¶](#section-3.2.1-3){.pilcrow}

The following process shall be used to formulate or modify policies
related to the RFC Series:[¶](#section-3.2.2-1){.pilcrow}

1.  [An individual or set of individuals generates a proposal in the
    form of an Internet-Draft (which must be submitted in full
    conformance with the provisions of \[[BCP78](#BCP78){.xref}\] and
    \[[BCP79](#BCP79){.xref}\]) and asks the RSWG to adopt the proposal
    as a working group
    item.[¶](#section-3.2.2-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.2.2-2.1}

2.  [The RSWG may adopt the proposal as a working group item if the
    chairs determine (by following working group procedures for rough
    consensus) that there is sufficient interest in the proposal; this
    is similar to the way a working group of the IETF would operate (see
    \[[RFC2418](#RFC2418){.xref}\]).[¶](#section-3.2.2-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.2.2-2.2}

3.  [The RSWG shall then further discuss and develop the proposal. All
    participants, but especially RSAB members, should pay special
    attention to any aspects of the proposal that have the potential to
    significantly modify long-standing policies or historical
    characteristics of the RFC Series as described in [Section
    7](#properties){.xref}. Members of the RSAB are expected to
    participate as individuals in all discussions relating to RSWG
    proposals. This should help to ensure that they are fully aware of
    proposals early in the RFC Series Policy Definition Process. It
    should also help to ensure that RSAB members will raise any issues
    or concerns during the development of the proposal and not wait
    until the RSAB review period. The RSWG Chairs are also expected to
    participate as
    individuals.[¶](#section-3.2.2-2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.2.2-2.3}

4.  [At some point, if the RSWG Chairs believe there may be rough
    consensus for the proposal to advance, they will issue a Last Call
    for comments within the working
    group.[¶](#section-3.2.2-2.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.2.2-2.4}

5.  [After a comment period of suitable length, the RSWG Chairs will
    determine whether rough consensus for the proposal exists (taking
    their own feedback as individuals into account along with feedback
    from other participants). If comments have been received and
    substantial changes have been made, additional Last Calls may be
    necessary. Once the chairs determine that consensus has been
    reached, they shall announce their determination on the RSWG email
    discussion list and forward the document to the
    RSAB.[¶](#section-3.2.2-2.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.2.2-2.5}

6.  [Once consensus is established in the RSWG, the RSAB shall issue a
    community call for comments as further described in [Section
    3.2.3](#cfc){.xref}. If substantial comments are received in
    response to the community call for comments, the RSAB may return the
    proposal to the RSWG to consider those comments and make revisions
    to address the feedback received. In parallel with the community
    call for comments, the RSAB itself shall also consider the
    proposal.[¶](#section-3.2.2-2.6){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.2.2-2.6}

7.  [If the scope of the revisions made in the previous step is
    substantial, an additional community call for comments should be
    issued by the RSAB, and the feedback received should be considered
    by the RSWG.[¶](#section-3.2.2-2.7){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.2.2-2.7}

8.  [Once the RSWG Chairs confirm that concerns received during the
    community call(s) for comments have been addressed, they shall
    inform the RSAB that the document is ready for balloting by the
    RSAB.[¶](#section-3.2.2-2.8){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.2.2-2.8}

    for their positions on the proposal. Positions may be as
    follows:[¶](#section-3.2.2-2.9.1){.pilcrow}
    :::

    -   [YES: the proposal should be
        approved[¶](#section-3.2.2-2.9.2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.2.2-2.9.2.1}

        interest[¶](#section-3.2.2-2.9.2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.2.2-2.9.2.3}

    Any RSAB member holding a CONCERN position must explain their
    concern to the community in detail. Nevertheless, the RSWG might not
    be able to come to consensus on modifications that will address the
    RSAB member\'s concern.[¶](#section-3.2.2-2.9.3){.pilcrow}

    There are three reasons why an RSAB member may file a position of
    CONCERN:[¶](#section-3.2.2-2.9.4){.pilcrow}

    -   [The RSAB member believes that the proposal represents a serious
        problem for one or more of the individual
        streams.[¶](#section-3.2.2-2.9.5.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.2.2-2.9.5.1}
    -   [The RSAB member believes that the proposal would cause serious
        harm to the overall RFC Series, including harm to the long-term
        health and viability of the
        Series.[¶](#section-3.2.2-2.9.5.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.2.2-2.9.5.2}
    -   [The RSAB member believes, based on the results of the community

        lacking.[¶](#section-3.2.2-2.9.5.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.2.2-2.9.5.3}

    Because RSAB members are expected to participate in the discussions
    within the RSWG and to raise any concerns and issues during those
    discussions, most CONCERN positions should not come as a surprise to
    the RSWG. Notwithstanding, late CONCERN positions are always
    possible if issues are identified during RSAB review or the
    community call(s) for comments.[¶](#section-3.2.2-2.9.6){.pilcrow}

10. [If a CONCERN exists, discussion will take place within the RSWG.

The RSAB is responsible for initiating and managing community calls for
comments on proposals that have gained consensus within the RSWG. The
RSAB should actively seek a wide range of input. The RSAB seeks such
input by, at a minimum, sending a notice to the
[rfc‑interest\@rfc‑editor.org](mailto:rfc-interest@rfc-editor.org) email
discussion list or to its successor or future equivalent. RSAB members
should also send a notice to the communities they directly represent
(e.g., the IETF and IRTF). Notices are also to be made available and
archived on the RFC Editor website. In addition, other communication
channels can be established for notices (e.g., via an RSS feed or by
posting to social media venues).[¶](#section-3.2.3-1){.pilcrow}

In cases where a proposal has the potential to significantly modify
long-standing policies or historical characteristics of the RFC Series
as described in [Section 7](#properties){.xref}, the RSAB should take
extra care to reach out to a very wide range of communities that make
use of RFCs (as described in [Section 3.1.1.2](#participation){.xref})
since such communities might not be actively engaged in the RSWG
directly. The RSAB should work with the stream approving bodies and the
IETF LLC to identify and establish contacts in such communities,
assisted by the RSCE in particular.[¶](#section-3.2.3-2){.pilcrow}

The RSAB should maintain a public list of communities that are contacted
during calls for comments.[¶](#section-3.2.3-3){.pilcrow}

community call for comments. If RSAB members conclude that such comments
raise important issues that need to be addressed, they should do so by
discussing those issues within the RSWG or (if the issues meet the
criteria specified in [Step 9](#step9){.xref} of [Section

Appeals of RSWG Chair decisions shall be made to the RSAB. Decisions of
the RSWG Chairs can be appealed only on grounds of failure to follow the
correct process. Appeals should be made within thirty (30) days of any
action or, in the case of failure to act, of notice having been given to
the RSWG Chairs. The RSAB will then decide if the process was followed
and will direct the RSWG Chairs as to what procedural actions are
required.[¶](#section-3.2.4-1){.pilcrow}

Decisions of the RSAB can be appealed on grounds of failure to follow
the correct process. In addition, if the RSAB makes a decision in order
to resolve a disagreement between authors and the RPC (as described in
[Section 4.4](#disagreements){.xref}), appeals can be filed on the basis
that the RSAB misinterpreted an approved policy. Aside from these two
cases, disagreements about the conduct of the RSAB are not subject to
appeal. Appeals of RSAB decisions shall be made to the IAB and should be
made within thirty (30) days of public notice of the relevant RSAB
decision (typically, when minutes are posted). The IAB shall decide
whether a process failure occurred and what (if any) corrective action
should take place.[¶](#section-3.2.4-2){.pilcrow}

Publication of RFCs is handled by the RFC Production Center
(RPC).[¶](#section-4.1-1){.pilcrow}

A few general considerations apply:[¶](#section-4.1-2){.pilcrow}

-   [The general roles and responsibilities of the RPC are defined by
    RFCs published in the Editorial Stream (i.e., not directly by the
    RSWG, RSAB, or RSCE), by existing RFCs that apply to the RPC and
    have not yet been superseded by Editorial Stream RFCs, and by the
    requisite
    contracts.[¶](#section-4.1-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.1-3.1}
-   [The RPC is advised by the RSCE and RSAB, and it has a duty to
    consult with them under specific circumstances, such as those
    relating to disagreements between authors and the RPC as described
    in [Section
    4.4](#disagreements){.xref}.[¶](#section-4.1-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.1-3.2}
-   [The RPC is overseen by the IETF LLC to ensure that it performs in
    accordance with contracts in
    place.[¶](#section-4.1-3.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.1-3.3}

All matters of budget, timetable, and impact on its performance targets
are between the RPC and IETF LLC.[¶](#section-4.1-4){.pilcrow}

The RPC shall regularly provide reports to the IETF LLC, RSAB, RSWG, and
broader community regarding its activities and any key risks or issues
affecting it.[¶](#section-4.1-5){.pilcrow}

In the event that the RPC is required to make a decision without
consultation that would normally deserve consultation, or makes a
decision against the advice of the RSAB, the RPC must notify the
RSAB.[¶](#section-4.1-6){.pilcrow}

This document does not specify the exact relationship between the IETF
LLC and the RPC; for example, the work of the RPC could be performed by
a separate corporate entity under contract to the IETF LLC, it could be
performed by employees of the IETF LLC, or the IETF LLC could engage
with independent contractors for some or all aspects of such work. The
exact relationship is a matter for the IETF LLC to
determine.[¶](#section-4.1-7){.pilcrow}

The IETF LLC is responsible for the method and management of the
engagement of the RPC. Therefore, the IETF LLC has authority over
negotiating performance targets for the RPC and also has responsibility
for ensuring that those targets are met. Such performance targets are
set based on the RPC\'s publication load and additional efforts required
to implement policies specified in Editorial Stream RFCs, in existing
RFCs that apply to the RPC and have not yet been superseded by Editorial
Stream RFCs, and in the requisite contracts. The IETF LLC may consult
with the community regarding these targets. The IETF LLC is empowered to
appoint a manager or to convene a committee to complete these
activities.[¶](#section-4.1-8){.pilcrow}

If individuals or groups within the community have concerns about the
performance of the RPC, they can request that the matter be investigated
by the IETF LLC Board, the IETF Executive Director, or a point of
contact designated by the IETF LLC Board. Even if the IETF LLC opts to
delegate this activity, concerns should be raised with the IETF LLC. The
IETF LLC is ultimately answerable to the community via the mechanisms
outlined in \[[RFC8711](#RFC8711){.xref}\].[¶](#section-4.1-9){.pilcrow}

The core responsibility of the RPC is the implementation of RFC Series
policies through publication of RFCs (including the dimensions of
document quality, timeliness of publication, and accessibility of
results), while taking into account issues raised by the community
through the RSWG and by the stream approving bodies. More specifically,
the RPC\'s responsibilities at the time of writing include the

During the process of editorial preparation and publication,
disagreements can arise between the authors of an RFC-to-be and the RPC.
Where an existing policy clearly applies, typically such disagreements
are handled in a straightforward manner through direct consultation
between the authors and the RPC, sometimes in collaboration with
stream-specific contacts.[¶](#section-4.4-1){.pilcrow}

However, if it is unclear whether an existing policy applies or if it is
unclear how to interpret an existing policy, the parties may need to
consult with additional individuals or bodies (e.g., RSAB, IESG, IRSG,
or stream approving bodies) to help achieve a resolution. The following
points are intended to provide more specific
guidance.[¶](#section-4.4-2){.pilcrow}

-   [If there is a conflict with a policy for a particular stream, to
    help achieve a resolution, the RPC should consult with the relevant
    stream approving body (such as the IESG or IRSG) and other
    representatives of the relevant stream as

    resolving the disagreement in a timely manner if necessary so that
    the relevant stream document(s) can be published before a new policy

publish RFCs that are Standards Track or Best Current Practice, since
such RFCs are reserved for the IETF Stream
\[[RFC8729](#RFC8729){.xref}\].) Notwithstanding the status of
Informational, it should be understood that documents published in the
Editorial Stream define policies for the RFC Series as a

The IAB requests that the IETF Trust and its Trustees assist in meeting
the goals and procedures set forth in this
document.[¶](#section-6.1-1){.pilcrow}

The Trustees are requested to publicly confirm their willingness and
ability to accept responsibility for the Intellectual Property Rights
(IPR) for the Editorial Stream.[¶](#section-6.1-2){.pilcrow}

Specifically, the Trustees are asked to develop the necessary
boilerplate to enable the suitable marking of documents so that the IETF
Trust receives the rights as specified in \[[BCP78](#BCP78){.xref}\].
These procedures need to also allow authors to indicate either no rights
to make derivative works or, preferentially, the right to make unlimited
derivative works from the documents. It is left to the Trust to specify
exactly how this shall be clearly indicated in each
document.[¶](#section-6.1-3){.pilcrow}

As specified above, contributors of documents for the Editorial Stream
are expected to use the IETF Internet-Draft process, complying therein
with the rules specified in \[[BCP9](#BCP9){.xref}\]. This includes the
disclosure of patent and trademark issues that are known, or can be
reasonably expected to be known, to the
contributor.[¶](#section-6.2-1){.pilcrow}

Disclosure of license terms for patents is also requested, as specified
in \[[BCP79](#BCP79){.xref}\]. The Editorial Stream has chosen to use
the [IETF\'s IPR disclosure mechanism](https://www.ietf.org/ipr/) for
this purpose. The IAB would prefer that the most liberal terms possible
be made available for Editorial Stream documents. Terms that do not
require fees or licensing are preferable. Non-discriminatory terms are
strongly preferred over those that discriminate among users. However,
although disclosure is required and the RSWG and the RSAB may consider
disclosures and terms in making a decision as to whether to submit a
document for publication, there are no specific requirements on the
licensing terms for intellectual property related to Editorial Stream
publication.[¶](#section-6.2-2){.pilcrow}

this boilerplate must be made through the RFC Series Policy Definition
Process specified in [Section 3](#policy-definition){.xref} of this

The processes and organizational models for publication of RFCs have
changed significantly over the years. Most recently, in 2009,
\[[RFC5620](#RFC5620){.xref}\] defined the RFC Editor Model (Version 1),
and in 2012, \[[RFC6635](#RFC6635){.xref}\] defined the RFC Editor Model
(Version 2), which was then modified slightly in 2020 by
\[[RFC8728](#RFC8728){.xref}\].[¶](#section-9-1){.pilcrow}

However, the community experienced several problems with versions 1 and
2, including a lack of transparency, a lack of avenues for community
input into policy definition, and unclear lines of authority and
responsibility.[¶](#section-9-2){.pilcrow}

To address these problems, in 2020, the IAB formed the RFC Editor Future
Development Program to conduct a community discussion and consensus
process for the further evolution of the RFC Editor Model. Under the
auspices of this Program, the community considered changes that would
increase transparency and community input regarding the definition of
policies for the RFC Series as a whole, while at the same time ensuring
the continuity of the RFC Series, maintaining the quality and timely
publication of RFCs, ensuring document accessibility, and clarifying
lines of authority and responsibility.[¶](#section-9-3){.pilcrow}

This document is the result of discussion within the Program and
describes version 3 of the RFC Editor Model while remaining consistent
with \[[RFC8729](#RFC8729){.xref}\].[¶](#section-9-4){.pilcrow}

The following sections describe the changes from version 2 in more
detail.[¶](#section-9-5){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-9.1 .section}
### [9.1.](#section-9.1){.section-number .selfRef} [RFC Editor Function](#name-rfc-editor-function){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-rfc-editor-function}

Several responsibilities previously assigned to the RFC Editor or, more
precisely, the RFC Editor function, are now performed by the RSWG, RSAB,
RPC, RSCE, and IETF LLC (alone or in combination). These include various
aspects of strategic leadership ([Section
2.1.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8728#section-2.1.1){.relref} of
\[[RFC8728](#RFC8728){.xref}\]), representation of the RFC Series
([Section
2.1.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8728#section-2.1.2){.relref} of
\[[RFC8728](#RFC8728){.xref}\]), development of RFC production and
publication ([Section
2.1.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8728#section-2.1.3){.relref} of
\[[RFC8728](#RFC8728){.xref}\]), development of the RFC Series ([Section
2.1.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8728#section-2.1.4){.relref} of
\[[RFC8728](#RFC8728){.xref}\]), operational oversight ([Section
3.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8729#section-3.3){.relref} of
\[[RFC8729](#RFC8729){.xref}\]), policy oversight ([Section
3.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8729#section-3.4){.relref} of
\[[RFC8729](#RFC8729){.xref}\]), the editing, processing, and
publication of documents ([Section
4.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8729#section-4.2){.relref} of
\[[RFC8729](#RFC8729){.xref}\]), and development and maintenance of
guidelines and rules that apply to the RFC Series ([Section
4.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8729#section-4.4){.relref} of
\[[RFC8729](#RFC8729){.xref}\]). Among other things, this changes the
dependency on the RFC Series Editor (RSE) included in [Section
2.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8730#section-2.2){.relref} of
\[[RFC8730](#RFC8730){.xref}\] with regard to \"coordinating work and
conforming to general RFC Series policies as specified by the IAB and
RSE.\" In addition, various details regarding these responsibilities
have been modified to accord with the framework defined in this
document.[¶](#section-9.1-1){.pilcrow}

### [9.2.](#section-9.2){.section-number .selfRef} [RFC Series Editor](#name-rfc-series-editor){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-rfc-series-editor}

Implied by the changes outlined in the previous section, the
responsibilities of the RFC Series Editor (RSE) as a person or role
(contrasted with the overall RFC Editor function) are now split or
shared among the RSWG, RSAB, RSCE, RPC, and IETF LLC (alone or in
combination). More specifically, the responsibilities of the RFC Series
Consulting Editor (RSCE) under version 3 of the RFC Editor Model differ
in many ways from the responsibilities of the RFC Series Editor under
version 2 of the RFC Editor Model. In general, references in existing
documents to the RSE can be taken as referring to the RFC Editor
function as described herein but should not be taken as referring to the
RSCE.[¶](#section-9.2-1){.pilcrow}

In practice, the RFC Production Center (RPC) and RFC Publisher roles

### [9.4.](#section-9.4){.section-number .selfRef} [IAB](#name-iab){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-iab}

Under earlier versions of the RFC Editor Model, the IAB was responsible
for oversight of the RFC Series and acted as a body for final conflict
resolution regarding the RFC Series. The IAB\'s authority in these
matters is described in the IAB Charter (\[[RFC2850](#RFC2850){.xref}\],
as updated by \[[RFC9283](#RFC9283){.xref}\]). Under version 2 of the
RFC Editor Model, the IAB delegated some of its authority to the RFC
Series Oversight Committee (see [Section 9.5](#rsoc){.xref}). Under
version 3 of the RFC Editor Model, authority for policy definition
resides with the RSWG as an independent venue for work by members of the
community (with approval of policy proposals being the responsibility of
the RSAB, which represents the streams and includes the RSCE), whereas
authority for policy implementation resides with the IETF
LLC.[¶](#section-9.4-1){.pilcrow}

In practice, the relationships and lines of authority and responsibility
between the IAB, RSOC, and RSE have proved unwieldy and somewhat opaque.
To overcome some of these issues, this document dispenses with the RSOC.
References to the RSOC in documents such as
\[[RFC8730](#RFC8730){.xref}\] are obsolete because this document
disbands the RSOC.[¶](#section-9.5-1){.pilcrow}

Version 1 of the RFC Editor Model \[[RFC5620](#RFC5620){.xref}\]
specified the existence of the RFC Series Advisory Group (RSAG), which
was no longer specified in version 2 of the RFC Editor Model. For the
avoidance of doubt, this document affirms that the RSAG has been
disbanded. (The RSAG is not to be confused with the RFC Series Approval
Board (RSAB), which this document

The same security considerations as those in
\[[RFC8729](#RFC8729){.xref}\] apply. The processes for the publication
of documents must prevent the introduction of unapproved changes.
Because multiple entities described in this document (most especially
the RPC) participate in maintenance of the index of publications,
sufficient security must be in place to prevent these published
documents from being changed by external parties. The archive of RFC
documents, any source documents needed to recreate the RFC documents,
and any associated original documents (such as lists of errata, tools,
and, for some early items, originals that are not machine-readable) need
to be secured against data storage failure.[¶](#section-10-1){.pilcrow}

The IETF LLC (along with any other contracting or contracted entities)
should take these security considerations into account during the
implementation and enforcement of any relevant
contracts.[¶](#section-10-2){.pilcrow}
