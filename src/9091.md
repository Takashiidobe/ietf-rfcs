# RFC 9091 {#rfcnum}

# Experimental Domain-Based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC) Extension for Public Suffix Domains {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC),
defined in RFC 7489, permits a domain-controlling organization to
express domain-level policies and preferences for message validation,
disposition, and reporting, which a mail-receiving organization can use
to improve mail handling.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

DMARC distinguishes the portion of a name that is a Public Suffix Domain
(PSD), below which Organizational Domain names are created. The basic
DMARC capability allows Organizational Domains to specify policies that
apply to their subdomains, but it does not give that capability to PSDs.
This document describes an extension to DMARC to fully enable DMARC
functionality for PSDs.[¶](#section-abstract-2){.pilcrow}

Some implementations of DMARC consider a PSD to be ineligible for DMARC
enforcement. This specification addresses that
case.[¶](#section-abstract-3){.pilcrow}

DMARC \[[RFC7489](#RFC7489){.xref}\] provides a mechanism for publishing
organizational policy information to email receivers. DMARC allows
policy to be specified for both individual domains and for
Organizational Domains and their subdomains within a single
organization.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

To determine the Organizational Domain for a message under evaluation,
and thus where to look for a policy statement, DMARC makes use of a
public suffix list. The process for doing this can be found in [Section
3.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7489#section-3.2){.relref} of the
DMARC specification \[[RFC7489](#RFC7489){.xref}\]. Currently, the most
common public suffix list being used is the one maintained by the
Mozilla Foundation and made public at
\<<https://publicsuffix.org>\>.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

In the basic DMARC model, Public Suffix Domains (PSDs) are not
Organizational Domains and are thus not subject to DMARC processing. In
DMARC, domains fall into one of three categories: Organizational
Domains, subdomains of Organizational Domains, or PSDs. A PSD can only
publish DMARC policy for itself and not for any subdomains under it. In
some cases, this limitation allows for the abuse of non-existent
organizational-level domains and hampers identification of domain abuse
in email.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

This document specifies experimental updates to the DMARC specification
\[[RFC7489](#RFC7489){.xref}\] in an attempt to mitigate this
abuse.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

::: {#example}
::: {#section-1.1 .section}
### [1.1.](#section-1.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Example](#name-example){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-example}

As an example, imagine a Top-Level Domain (TLD), \".example\", that has
public subdomains for government and commercial use (\".gov.example\"
and \".com.example\"). The maintainer of a list of such a PSD structure
would include entries for both of these subdomains, thereby indicating
that they are PSDs, below which Organizational Domains can be
registered. Suppose further that there exists a legitimate domain called
\"tax.gov.example\", registered within
\".gov.example\".[¶](#section-1.1-1){.pilcrow}

By exploiting the typically unauthenticated nature of email, there are
regular malicious campaigns to impersonate this organization that use
similar-looking (\"cousin\") domains such as \"t4x.gov.example\". Such
domains are not registered.[¶](#section-1.1-2){.pilcrow}

Within the \".gov.example\" public suffix, use of DMARC has been
mandated, so \"gov.example\" publishes the following DMARC DNS
record:[¶](#section-1.1-3){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-1.1-4}
``` sourcecode
_dmarc.gov.example. IN TXT ( "v=DMARC1; p=reject;"
                             "rua=mailto:dmc@dmarc.svc.gov.example" )
```

[¶](#section-1.1-4){.pilcrow}
:::

This DMARC record provides policy and a reporting destination for mail
sent from \@gov.example. Similarly, \"tax.gov.example\" will have a
DMARC record that specifies policy for mail sent from addresses
\@tax.gov.example. However, due to DMARC\'s current method of
discovering and applying policy at the Organizational Domain level, the
non-existent Organizational Domain of \@t4x.gov.example does not and
cannot fall under a DMARC policy.[¶](#section-1.1-5){.pilcrow}

Defensively registering all variants of \"tax\" is not a scalable
strategy. The intent of this specification, therefore, is to enhance the
DMARC discovery method by enabling an agent receiving such a message to
be able to determine that a relevant policy is present at
\"gov.example\", which is precluded by the current DMARC
specification.[¶](#section-1.1-6){.pilcrow}

::: {#discussion}
::: {#section-1.2 .section}
### [1.2.](#section-1.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Discussion](#name-discussion){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-discussion}

This document provides a simple extension to
\[[RFC7489](#RFC7489){.xref}\] to allow operators of Public Suffix
Domains (PSDs) to:[¶](#section-1.2-1){.pilcrow}

-   [Express policy at the level of the PSD that covers all
    Organizational Domains that do not explicitly publish DMARC
    records[¶](#section-1.2-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-1.2-2.1}
-   [Extend the DMARC policy query functionality to detect and process
    such a policy[¶](#section-1.2-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-1.2-2.2}
-   [Describe receiver feedback for such
    policies[¶](#section-1.2-2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-1.2-2.3}
-   [Provide controls to mitigate potential privacy considerations
    associated with this
    extension[¶](#section-1.2-2.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-1.2-2.4}

This document also provides a new DMARC tag to indicate requested
handling policy for non-existent subdomains. This is provided
specifically to support phased deployment of PSD DMARC but is expected
to be useful more generally. Undesired rejection risks for mail
purporting to be from domains that do not exist are substantially lower
than for those that do, so the operational risk of requesting harsh
policy treatment (e.g., reject) is lower.[¶](#section-1.2-3){.pilcrow}

As an additional benefit, the PSD DMARC extension clarifies existing
requirements. Based on the requirements of
\[[RFC7489](#RFC7489){.xref}\], DMARC should function above the
organizational level for exact domain matches (i.e., if a DMARC record
were published for \"example\", then mail from example\@example should
be subject to DMARC processing). Testing has revealed that this is not
consistently applied in different
implementations.[¶](#section-1.2-4){.pilcrow}

There are two types of Public Suffix Operators (PSOs) for which this
extension would be useful and appropriate:[¶](#section-1.2-5){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

Branded PSDs (e.g., \".google\"):
:   These domains are effectively Organizational Domains as discussed in
    \[[RFC7489](#RFC7489){.xref}\]. They control all subdomains of the
    tree. These are effectively private domains but listed in the
    current public suffix list. They are treated as public for DMARC
    purposes. They require the same protections as DMARC Organizational
    Domains but are currently unable to benefit from
    DMARC.[¶](#section-1.2-6.2){.pilcrow}
:   

Multi-organization PSDs that require DMARC usage (e.g., \".bank\"):
:   Because existing Organizational Domains using this PSD have their
    own DMARC policy, the applicability of this extension is for
    non-existent domains. The extension allows the brand protection
    benefits of DMARC to extend to the entire PSD, including cousin
    domains of registered organizations.[¶](#section-1.2-6.4){.pilcrow}
:   

Due to the design of DMARC and the nature of the Internet [email
architecture](#RFC5598){.xref} \[[RFC5598](#RFC5598){.xref}\], there are
interoperability issues associated with DMARC deployment. These are
discussed in \"Interoperability Issues between Domain-based Message
Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC) and Indirect Email
Flows\" \[[RFC7960](#RFC7960){.xref}\]. These issues are not typically
applicable to PSDs since they (e.g., the \".gov.example\" used above) do
not typically send mail.[¶](#section-1.2-7){.pilcrow}

### [2.2.](#section-2.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Public Suffix Domain (PSD)](#name-public-suffix-domain-psd){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-public-suffix-domain-psd}

The global Internet Domain Name System (DNS) is documented in numerous
RFCs. It defines a tree of names starting with root, \".\", immediately
below which are Top-Level Domain names such as \".com\" and \".us\". The
domain name structure consists of a tree of names, each of which is made
of a sequence of words (\"labels\") separated by period characters. The
root of the tree is simply called \".\". The Internet community at
large, through processes and policies external to this work, selects
points in this tree at which to register domain names \"owned\" by
independent organizations. Real-world examples are \".com\", \".org\",
\".us\", and \".gov.uk\". Names at which such registrations occur are
called \"Public Suffix Domains (PSDs)\", and a registration consists of
a label selected by the registrant to which a desirable PSD is appended.
For example, \"ietf.org\" is a registered domain name, and \".org\" is
its PSD.[¶](#section-2.2-1){.pilcrow}

In addition to the DMARC Domain Owner actions, PSOs that require use of

Experience with DMARC has shown that some implementations short-circuit
messages, bypassing DMARC policy application, when the domain name
extracted by the receiver (from the RFC5322.From domain) is on the

As an example, for a message with the Organizational Domain of
\"example.compute.cloudcompany.com.example\", the query for PSD DMARC
would use \"compute.cloudcompany.com.example\" as the longest PSD. The
receiver would check to see if that PSD is listed in the DMARC PSD
Registry, and if so, perform the policy lookup at
\"\_dmarc.compute.cloudcompany.com.example\".[¶](#section-3.6-3){.pilcrow}

Note: Because the PSD policy query comes after the Organizational Domain
policy query, PSD policy is not used for Organizational Domains that
have published a DMARC policy. Specifically, this is not a mechanism to
provide feedback addresses (RUA/RUF) when an Organizational Domain has
declined to do so.[¶](#section-3.6-4){.pilcrow}

These privacy considerations are developed based on the requirements of
\[[RFC6973](#RFC6973){.xref}\]. Additionally, the privacy considerations
of \[[RFC7489](#RFC7489){.xref}\] apply to the mechanisms described by
this document. To participate in this experiment, implementations should
be aware of the privacy considerations described in this section. If
this experiment is successful, this section should be incorporated into
the \"Privacy Considerations\" section as \"Feedback
Leakage\".[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

Providing feedback reporting to PSOs can, in some cases, cause
information to leak out of an organization to the PSO. This leakage
could potentially be utilized as part of a program of pervasive
surveillance (see \[[RFC7624](#RFC7624){.xref}\]). There are roughly
three cases to consider:[¶](#section-4-2){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

Single Organization PSDs (e.g., \".google\"):
:   RUA and RUF reports based on PSD DMARC have the potential to contain
    information about emails related to entities managed by the
    organization. Since both the PSO and the Organizational Domain
    Owners are common, there is no additional privacy risk for either
    normal or non-existent domain reporting due to PSD
    DMARC.[¶](#section-4-3.2){.pilcrow}
:   

Multi-organization PSDs that require DMARC usage (e.g., \".bank\"):
:   Reports based on PSD DMARC will only be generated for domains that
    do not publish a DMARC policy at the organizational or host level.
    For domains that do publish the required DMARC policy records, the
    feedback reporting addresses (RUA and RUF) of the organization (or
    hosts) will be used. The only direct risk of feedback leakage for
    these PSDs are for Organizational Domains that are out of compliance
    with PSD policy. Data on non-existent cousin domains would be sent
    to the PSO.[¶](#section-4-3.4){.pilcrow}
:   

Multi-organization PSDs (e.g., \".com\") that do not mandate DMARC usage:
:   Privacy risks for Organizational Domains that have not deployed
    DMARC within such PSDs are significant. For non-DMARC Organizational
    Domains, all DMARC feedback will be directed to the PSO. PSD DMARC
    is opt out (by publishing a DMARC record at the Organizational
    Domain level) instead of opt in, which would be the more desirable
    characteristic. This means that any non-DMARC Organizational Domain
    would have its Feedback Reports redirected to the PSO. The content
    of such reports, particularly for existing domains, is privacy
    sensitive.[¶](#section-4-3.6){.pilcrow}
:   

PSOs will receive feedback on non-existent domains, which may be similar
to existing Organizational Domains. Feedback related to such cousin
domains have a small risk of carrying information related to an actual
Organizational Domain. To minimize this potential concern, PSD DMARC
feedback [MUST]{.bcp14} be limited to Aggregate Reports. Feedback
Reports carry more detailed information and present a greater
risk.[¶](#section-4-4){.pilcrow}

Due to the inherent privacy and security risks associated with PSD DMARC
for Organizational Domains in multi-organization PSDs that do not
participate in DMARC, any feedback reporting related to
multi-organizational PSDs [MUST]{.bcp14} be limited to non-existent
domains except in cases where the reporter knows that PSO requires use
of DMARC (by checking the DMARC PSD
Registry).[¶](#section-4-5){.pilcrow}
