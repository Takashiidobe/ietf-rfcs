# Propagation of ARP/ND Flags in an Ethernet Virtual Private Network (EVPN) {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

This document defines an Extended Community that is advertised along
with an Ethernet Virtual Private Network (EVPN) Media Access Control
(MAC) / IP Advertisement route and carries information relevant to the
Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) / Neighbor Discovery (ND) resolution
so that an EVPN Provider Edge (PE) implementing a proxy-ARP/ND function
in broadcast domains (BDs) or an ARP/ND function on Integrated Routing
and Bridging (IRB) interfaces can reply to ARP Requests or Neighbor
Solicitation (NS) messages with the correct
information.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

An EVPN MAC/IP Advertisement route can optionally carry IPv4 or IPv6
addresses associated with a MAC address. Remote PE routers can use this
information to populate their ARP or ND tables on IRB interfaces or
their proxy-ARP/ND tables in BDs. PEs can then reply locally (act as an
ARP/ND proxy, as per \[[RFC7432](#RFC7432){.xref}\]) to IPv4 ARP
Requests and IPv6 Neighbor Solicitation messages and reduce or suppress
the flooding produced by the address resolution procedure. However, the
information conveyed in the EVPN MAC/IP Advertisement route may not be
enough for the remote PE to reply to local ARP or ND requests. For
example, if a PE learns an IPv6 address and MAC address combination ND
entry via EVPN (denoted by IPv6-\>MAC), the PE would not know if that
particular IPv6-\>MAC pair belongs to a router or a host or if that
address is an anycast address, as this information is not carried in the
EVPN MAC/IP Advertisement routes.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

This document defines an Extended Community that is advertised along
with an EVPN MAC/IP Advertisement route and carries information relevant
to the ARP/ND resolution so that an EVPN PE implementing a proxy-ARP/ND
function can reply to ARP Requests or Neighbor Solicitations with the
correct information. In particular, the flags defined in
\[[RFC4861](#RFC4861){.xref}\] can now be conveyed along with a MAC/IP
Advertisement route so that an egress EVPN PE can issue Neighbor
Advertisement (NA) messages with the correct flag
information.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

The flags are carried in the EVPN Address Resolution Protocol and
Neighbor Discovery (ARP/ND) Extended Community, as described in the
following sections.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

The following flags are defined in the Flags field, the third octet of
the Extended Community:[¶](#section-2-3){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

R:

:   Router flag (corresponds to Bit 23 of the Extended
    Community)[¶](#section-2-4.2.1){.pilcrow}

    Bit 7 of the Flags field is defined as the \"Router flag\". When
    set, the R flag indicates that the IPv6-\>MAC pair advertised in the
    MAC/IP Advertisement route, along with the Extended Community,
    belongs to an IPv6 router. If the R flag is zero, the IPv6-\>MAC
    pair belongs to a host. The receiving PE implementing the ND
    function will use this information in Neighbor Advertisement
    messages for the associated IPv6 address. This flag has no meaning
    for ARP IPv4-\>MAC entries and [MUST]{.bcp14} be ignored when the
    Extended Community is received with an EVPN MAC/IP Advertisement
    route for an IPv4-\>MAC pair.[¶](#section-2-4.2.2){.pilcrow}

:   

O:

:   Override flag (corresponds to Bit 22 of the Extended
    Community)[¶](#section-2-4.4.1){.pilcrow}

    Bit 6 of the Flags field is defined as the \"Override flag\". An
    egress PE will normally advertise IPv6-\>MAC pairs with the O flag
    set, and only when IPv6 \"anycast\" is enabled in the BD or
    interface will the PE send an IPv6-\>MAC pair with the O flag = 0.
    The ingress PE will install the ND entry with the received O flag
    and will always use this O flag value when replying to a Neighbor
    Solicitation for the IPv6 address. Similarly to the Router Flag, the
    Override flag has no meaning for ARP IPv4-\>MAC entries and
    [MUST]{.bcp14} be ignored when the Extended Community is received
    with an EVPN MAC/IP Advertisement route for an IPv4-\>MAC
    pair.[¶](#section-2-4.4.2){.pilcrow}

:   

I:

:   Immutable ARP/ND Binding flag (corresponds to Bit 20 of the Extended
    Community)[¶](#section-2-4.6.1){.pilcrow}

    Bit 4 of the Flags field is defined as the \"Immutable ARP/ND
    Binding flag\". When set, the egress PE indicates that the IP-\>MAC
    pair that was sent in an EVPN MAC/IP Advertisement route (along with
    the Extended Community) is a configured ARP/ND entry. In this case,
    the IP address in the EVPN MAC/IP Advertisement route can only be
    bound together with the MAC address specified in the same route, and
    not with any other MAC addresses received in a different route
    without the I flag set.[¶](#section-2-4.6.2){.pilcrow}

:   

Bits 0-3 and 5 are not assigned by this document. They [MUST]{.bcp14} be

When an IP-\>MAC entry is not learned via EVPN, a PE may learn IP-\>MAC
pairs in the management plane (this will create static entries in the
ARP/ND or proxy-ARP/ND table) or by snooping ARP or NA messages coming
from the CE (this will create dynamic entries). Those static and dynamic
IP-\>MAC entries will be advertised in EVPN MAC/IP Advertisement routes
that use the EVPN ARP/ND Extended Community as
follows:[¶](#section-3.1-1){.pilcrow}

-   [Advertised MAC/IP Advertisement routes for IPv6-\>MAC entries
    [MUST]{.bcp14} include one (and only one) ARP/ND Extended Community
    with the R and O flag values associated with the entry. Those flag
    values are either dynamically learned (from NA messages) or
    configured in case of static
    entries.[¶](#section-3.1-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.1-2.1}
-   [MAC/IP Advertisement routes for IPv4-\>MAC entries [MAY]{.bcp14}

        so, if an update for the same immutable and static IP1-\>MAC1 is
        received from a different PE, one of the two routes will be
        selected. This is analogous to the case described in [Section
        15.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7432#section-15.2){.relref}
        of \[[RFC7432](#RFC7432){.xref}\] when two MAC/IP routes with
        the static flag set are received, and the PE likewise

        situation.[¶](#section-3.2-2.4.2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.2-2.4.2.3}
    :::

In a situation where a host (with an IP-\>MAC that is configured as
immutable binding in the attached PE) is allowed to move between PEs
(that is, the associated MAC is non-static), PEs can receive multiple
MAC/IP Advertisement routes for the same IP-\>MAC. In such situations,
MAC mobility procedures as in \[[RFC7432](#RFC7432){.xref}\] dictate the
reachability of the MAC.[¶](#section-3.2-3){.pilcrow}

As an example of the use of the I flag, consider PE1, PE2, and PE3
attached to the same BD. PE1 originates an EVPN MAC/IP Advertisement
route for IP1-\>MAC1 with the I flag set to 1 later on, PE2 also
originates an EVPN MAC/IP Advertisement route IP1-\>MAC1 with a higher
sequence number and the I flag set to 1. Then all the EVPN PEs attached
to the same BD [SHOULD]{.bcp14} retain their IP1-\>MAC1 ARP/ND binding
but update MAC1\'s forwarding destination to PE2. For some reason, if
PE3 originates an EVPN MAC/IP Advertisement route for IP1-\>MAC2 with
the I flag set to 0 (even with a higher sequence number), then the EVPN
PEs in the BD will not update their IP1-\>MAC1 ARP/ND bindings since IP1
is bound to MAC1 (MAC2 [SHOULD]{.bcp14} still be programmed in the Layer
2 BDs). This is considered a misconfiguration in
PE3.[¶](#section-3.2-4){.pilcrow}

When the I flag is set to 1, a given IP is assumed to be always bound to
the same MAC address; therefore, the mobility procedures described in

## [4.](#section-4){.section-number .selfRef} [Security Considerations](#name-security-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-security-considerations}

The same security considerations described in
\[[RFC7432](#RFC7432){.xref}\] apply to this document. In general, it is
worth noting that the use of proxy-ARP/ND in EVPN BDs may add some
security risks. Attackers can make use of ARP/ND messages to create
state in all the PEs attached to the same BD as the attacker and exhaust
resources in those PEs. Therefore, additional security mechanisms may be
needed. Some examples of such additional security mechanisms are
limiting the number of proxy-ARP/ND entries per BD and/or per port or
closely monitoring the rate at which hosts create dynamic proxy-ARP/ND
entries.[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

In addition, this document adds pieces of information that impact the
way ARP/ND entries are installed in ARP/ND and/or proxy-ARP/ND tables
and, therefore, impacts the resolution protocols for IPv4 and IPv6
addresses. For instance, if a given IPv6-\>MAC binding is configured
with the wrong R or O flags (intentionally or not) on a given PE, the
rest of the PEs attached to the same BD will install the wrong
information for the IPv6-\>MAC. This will cause all the PEs in the BD to
reply to Neighbor Solicitations for the IPv6 with NA messages containing
the wrong R and O flags. For example, as specified in
\[[RFC4861](#RFC4861){.xref}\], the receiver of an NA message with O not
set will not update its existing cache entry for the IP-\>MAC; hence,
the communication between the owner of the IP address and the receiver
of the NA message with the wrong O flag will fail. Similarly, the
receiver of an NA message with the wrong R flag may update its Default
Router List by incorrectly adding or removing an entry, which could, for
example, lead to sending traffic to a node that is not a router, causing
the traffic to be dropped.[¶](#section-4-2){.pilcrow}

The I flag, or Immutable ARP/ND Binding flag, is a useful security tool,
allowing an operator to ensure a given IP address is always bound to the
same MAC and that information is distributed to all the PEs attached to
the same BD. ARP/ND spoofing attacks, in which a malicious host injects
Gratuitous ARPs or unsolicited NAs for that IP address with a different
MAC address, will not succeed in programming the ARP/ND and proxy-ARP/ND
tables and therefore the spoofer will not receive the
traffic.[¶](#section-4-3){.pilcrow}

IANA has changed the name for Sub-Type Value 0x08 in the \"EVPN Extended
Community Sub-Types\" registry
\[[IANA-BGP-EXT-COMM](#IANA-BGP-EXT-COMM){.xref}\] to the
following:[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}
