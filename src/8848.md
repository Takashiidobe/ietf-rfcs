# Session Signaling for Controlling Multiple Streams for Telepresence (CLUE) {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

This document is about Controlling Multiple Streams for Telepresence
(CLUE) signaling. It specifies how the CLUE protocol and the CLUE data
channel are used in conjunction with each other and with existing
signaling mechanisms, such as SIP and the Session Description Protocol
(SDP), to produce a telepresence call.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

To enable devices to participate in a telepresence call, where they
select the sources they wish to view, receive those media sources, and
display them in an optimal fashion, Controlling Multiple Streams for
Telepresence (CLUE) employs two principal and interrelated protocol
negotiations. SDP \[[RFC4566](#RFC4566){.xref}\], conveyed via SIP
\[[RFC3261](#RFC3261){.xref}\], is used to negotiate the specific media
capabilities that can be delivered to specific addresses on a device.
Meanwhile, CLUE protocol messages \[[RFC8847](#RFC8847){.xref}\],
transported via a CLUE data channel \[[RFC8850](#RFC8850){.xref}\], are
used to negotiate the Capture Sources available, their attributes, and
any constraints in their use. They also allow the far-end device to
specify which Captures they wish to receive. It is recommended that
those documents be read prior to this one as this document assumes
familiarity with those protocols and hence uses terminology from each
with limited introduction.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

Beyond negotiating the CLUE channel, SDP is also used to negotiate the
details of supported media streams and the maximum capability of each of
those streams. As the CLUE Framework \[[RFC8845](#RFC8845){.xref}\]
defines a manner in which the Media Provider expresses their maximum
Encoding Group capabilities, SDP is also used to express the encoding
limits for each potential Encoding.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

Backwards compatibility is an important consideration of the protocol:
it is vital that a CLUE-capable device contacting a device that does not
support CLUE is able to fall back to a fully functional non-CLUE call.
The document also defines how a non-CLUE call may be upgraded to CLUE
mid-call and, similarly, how CLUE functionality can be removed mid-call
to return to a standard non-CLUE call.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

This section defines a new SDP Grouping Framework
\[[RFC5888](#RFC5888){.xref}\] extension called
\'CLUE\'.[¶](#section-4.1-1){.pilcrow}

The CLUE extension can be indicated using an SDP session-level \'group\'
attribute. Each SDP media \"m=\" line that is included in this group,
using SDP media-level mid attributes, is CLUE controlled by a CLUE data
channel that is also included in this CLUE
group.[¶](#section-4.1-2){.pilcrow}

Currently, only support for a single CLUE group is specified; support
for multiple CLUE groups in a single session is outside the scope of
this document. A device [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} include more than one CLUE
group in its SDP message unless it is following a specification that
defines how multiple CLUE channels are signaled and is able to either
determine that the other side of the SDP exchange supports multiple CLUE
channels or fail gracefully in the event it does
not.[¶](#section-4.1-3){.pilcrow}

The CLUE data channel \[[RFC8850](#RFC8850){.xref}\] is a bidirectional
data channel \[[RFC8831](#RFC8831){.xref}\] used for the transport of
CLUE messages, conveyed within an SCTP over DTLS connection. This
channel must be established before CLUE protocol messages can be
exchanged and CLUE-controlled media can be
sent.[¶](#section-4.2-1){.pilcrow}

The data channel is negotiated over SDP as described in
\[[RFC8864](#RFC8864){.xref}\]. A CLUE-capable device wishing to
negotiate CLUE [MUST]{.bcp14} also include a CLUE group in their SDP
Offer or Answer and include the \"mid\" of the \"m=\" line for the data
channel in that group. The CLUE group [MUST]{.bcp14} include the \"mid\"
of the \"m=\" line for one (and only one) data

Presence of the data channel in the CLUE group in an SDP Offer or Answer
also serves, along with the \"sip.clue\" media feature tag, as an
indication that the device supports CLUE and wishes to upgrade the call
to include CLUE-controlled media. A CLUE-capable device [SHOULD]{.bcp14}

CLUE-controlled media lines in an SDP are \"m=\" lines in which the
content of the media streams to be sent is negotiated via the CLUE
protocol \[[RFC8847](#RFC8847){.xref}\]. For an \"m=\" line to be CLUE

\"m=\" lines not specified as being under CLUE control follow normal
rules for media streams negotiated in SDP as defined in documents such

The restrictions on CLUE-controlled media that are defined below always

The CLUE Framework \[[RFC8845](#RFC8845){.xref}\] defines the concept of
\"Encodings\", which represent the sender\'s encode ability. Each
Encoding the Media Provider wishes to signal is done so via an \"m=\"
line of the appropriate media type, which [MUST]{.bcp14} be marked as
sendonly with the \"a=sendonly\" attribute or as inactive with the
\"a=inactive\" attribute.[¶](#section-4.4.1-1){.pilcrow}

The encoder limits of active (e.g., \"a=sendonly\") Encodings can then
be expressed using existing SDP syntax. For instance, for H.264, see
Table 6 in [Section
8.2.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6184#section-8.2.2){.relref} of
\[[RFC6184](#RFC6184){.xref}\] for a list of valid parameters for
representing encoder sender stream
limits.[¶](#section-4.4.1-2){.pilcrow}

These Encodings are CLUE controlled and hence [MUST]{.bcp14} include a
\"mid\" in the CLUE group as defined
above.[¶](#section-4.4.1-3){.pilcrow}

In addition to the normal restrictions defined in
\[[RFC3264](#RFC3264){.xref}\], the stream [MUST]{.bcp14} be treated as
if the \"m=\" line direction attribute had been set to \"a=inactive\"
until the Media Provider has received a valid CLUE \'configure\' message
specifying the Capture to be used for this stream. This means that RTP
packets [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be sent until configuration is complete,
while non-media packets such as STUN, RTCP, and DTLS [MUST]{.bcp14} be
sent as per their relevant specifications, if
negotiated.[¶](#section-4.4.1-4){.pilcrow}

Every \"m=\" line representing a CLUE Encoding [MUST]{.bcp14} contain a
\"label\" attribute as defined in \[[RFC4574](#RFC4574){.xref}\]. This
label is used to identify the Encoding by the sender in CLUE
\'advertisement\' messages and by the receiver in CLUE \'configure\'
messages. Each label used for a CLUE-controlled \"m=\" line
[MUST]{.bcp14} be different from the label on all other \"m=\" lines in
the CLUE group, unless an \"m=\" line represents a dependent stream
related to another \"m=\" line (such as a Forward Error Correction (FEC)
stream), in which case it [MUST]{.bcp14} have the same label value as
the \"m=\" line on which it depends.[¶](#section-4.4.1-5){.pilcrow}

protocol messages \-- this is how the protocol defines which Encodings
are a part of an Encoding Group (in \'advertisement\' messages) and

Each \<encID> (in encodingIDList) in a CLUE \'advertisement\' message
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} represent an Encoding defined in SDP; the specific
Encoding referenced is a CLUE-controlled \"m=\" line in the most recent
SDP Offer/Answer message sent by the sender of the \'advertisement\'
message with a label value corresponding to the text content of the
\<encID>. If the \<encID> is not defined in SDP, it [MUST]{.bcp14} be
one it anticipates sending in a subsequent SDP Offer/Answer
exchange.[¶](#section-4.4.1.1-2){.pilcrow}

Each \<encodingID> (in captureEncodingType) in a CLUE \'configure\'

Note that the non-atomic nature of SDP/CLUE protocol interaction may
mean that there are temporary periods where an \<encID>/\<encodingID> in

of the most recent SDP negotiation (unless the SDP negotiation has
removed the CLUE channel).[¶](#section-5.1-1){.pilcrow}

The primary implication of this is that a device may receive an SDP
Offer/Answer message with a CLUE Encoding for which it does not yet have
Capture information or receive a CLUE \'configure\' message specifying a
Capture Encoding for which the far end has not negotiated a media stream
in SDP.[¶](#section-5.1-2){.pilcrow}

CLUE messages contain an \<encID> (in encodingIDList) or \<encodingID>
(in captureEncodingType), which is used to identify a specific Encoding
or captureEncoding in SDP; see \[[RFC8846](#RFC8846){.xref}\] for
specifics. The non-atomic nature of CLUE negotiation means that a sender
may wish to send a new CLUE \'advertisement\' message before the
corresponding SDP message. As such, the sender of the CLUE message
[MAY]{.bcp14} include an \<encID> that does not currently match a
CLUE-controlled \"m=\" line label in SDP; a CLUE-capable implementation
[MUST NOT]{.bcp14} reject a CLUE protocol message solely because it
contains \<encID> elements that do not match a label in
SDP.[¶](#section-5.1-3){.pilcrow}

The current state of the CLUE Participant or Media Provider/Consumer
state machines does not affect compliance with any of the normative
language of \[[RFC3264](#RFC3264){.xref}\]. That is, they [MUST
NOT]{.bcp14} delay an ongoing SDP exchange as part of a SIP server or
client transaction; an implementation [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} delay an SDP
exchange while waiting for CLUE negotiation to complete or for a
\'configure\' message to arrive.[¶](#section-5.1-4){.pilcrow}

Similarly, a device in a CLUE-enabled call [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} delay any
mandatory state transitions in the CLUE Participant or Media
Provider/Consumer state machines due to the presence or absence of an
ongoing SDP exchange.[¶](#section-5.1-5){.pilcrow}

A device with the CLUE Participant state machine in the ACTIVE state
[MAY]{.bcp14} choose to delay moving from ESTABLISHED to ADV (Media
Provider state machine) or from ESTABLISHED to WAIT FOR CONF RESPONSE
(Media Consumer state machine) based on the SDP state. See
\[[RFC8847](#RFC8847){.xref}\] for CLUE state machine specifics.
Similarly, a device [MAY]{.bcp14} choose to delay initiating a new SDP
exchange based on the state of their CLUE state
machines.[¶](#section-5.1-6){.pilcrow}

While SDP and CLUE message states do not impose constraints on each
other, both impose constraints on the sending of media \--
CLUE-controlled media [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be sent unless it has been
negotiated in both CLUE and SDP: an implementation [MUST NOT]{.bcp14}

that Encoding.[¶](#section-5.2-1){.pilcrow}

### [5.3.](#section-5.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Recommendations for Operating with Non-atomic Operations](#name-recommendations-for-operati){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-recommendations-for-operati}

CLUE-capable devices [MUST]{.bcp14} be able to handle states in which
CLUE messages make reference to EncodingIDs that do not match the most
recently received SDP, irrespective of the order in which SDP and CLUE
messages are received. While these mismatches will usually be
transitory, a device [MUST]{.bcp14} be able to cope with such mismatches
remaining indefinitely. However, this document makes some
recommendations on message ordering for these non-atomic
transitions.[¶](#section-5.3-1){.pilcrow}

CLUE-capable devices [MUST]{.bcp14} ensure that any inconsistencies
between SDP and CLUE signaling are temporary by sending updated SDP or
CLUE messages as soon as the relevant state machines and other
constraints permit.[¶](#section-5.3-2){.pilcrow}

Generally, implementations that receive messages with incomplete
information will be most efficient if they wait until they have the
corresponding information they lack before sending messages to make
changes related to that information. For example, an answerer that
receives a new SDP Offer with three new \"a=sendonly\" CLUE \"m=\" lines
for which it has received no CLUE \'advertisement\' message providing
the corresponding capture information would typically include
corresponding \"a=inactive\" lines in its answer, and it would only make
a new SDP Offer with \"a=recvonly\" when and if a new \'advertisement\'
message arrives with Captures relevant to those
Encodings.[¶](#section-5.3-3){.pilcrow}

Because of the constraints of SDP Offer/Answer and because new SDP
negotiations are generally more \'costly\' than sending a new CLUE
message, implementations needing to make changes to both channels
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} prioritize sending the updated CLUE message over
sending the new SDP message. The aim is for the recipient to receive the
CLUE changes before the SDP changes, allowing the recipient to send
their SDP Answers without incomplete information and reducing the number
of new SDP Offers required.[¶](#section-5.3-4){.pilcrow}

The CLUE Framework \[[RFC8845](#RFC8845){.xref}\] allows for Multiple
Content Captures (MCCs): Captures that contain multiple source Captures,
whether composited into a single stream or switched based on some
metric.[¶](#section-6-1){.pilcrow}

The Captures that contribute to these MCCs may or may not be defined in
the \'advertisement\' message. If they are defined and the MCC is
providing them in a switched format, the recipient may wish to determine
which originating source Capture is currently being provided, so that
they can apply geometric corrections based on that Capture\'s geometry
or take some other action based on the original Capture
information.[¶](#section-6-2){.pilcrow}

To do this, \[[RFC8849](#RFC8849){.xref}\] allows for the CaptureID of
the originating Capture to be conveyed via RTP or RTCP. A Media Provider
sending switched media for an MCC with defined originating sources
[MUST]{.bcp14} send the CaptureID in both RTP and RTCP, as described in
the mapping document.[¶](#section-6-3){.pilcrow}

### [6.1.](#section-6.1){.section-number .selfRef} [CaptureID Reception during MCC Redefinition](#name-captureid-reception-during-){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-captureid-reception-during-}

Because the RTP/RTCP CaptureID is delivered via a different channel to
the \'advertisement\' message in which in the contents of the MCC are
defined, there is an intrinsic race condition in cases where the
contents of an MCC are redefined.[¶](#section-6.1-1){.pilcrow}

When a Media Provider redefines an MCC that involves CaptureIDs, the
reception of the relevant CaptureIDs by the recipient will either lead
or lag reception and the processing of the new \'advertisement\' message
by the recipient. As such, a Media Consumer [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be
disrupted by any of the following scenarios in any CLUE-controlled media
stream it is receiving, whether that stream is for a static Capture or
for an MCC (as any static Capture may be redefined to an MCC in a later

### [7.1.](#section-7.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Overview](#name-overview){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-overview}

A CLUE call may involve sending and/or receiving significant numbers of
media streams. Conventionally, media streams are sent and received on
unique ports. However, each separate port used for this purpose may
impose costs that a device wishes to avoid, such as the need to open
that port on firewalls and NATs, the need to collect Interactive
Connectivity Establishment (ICE) candidates
\[[RFC8445](#RFC8445){.xref}\], etc.[¶](#section-7.1-1){.pilcrow}

The BUNDLE extension \[[RFC8843](#RFC8843){.xref}\] can be used to
negotiate the multiplexing of multiple media lines onto a single 5-tuple
for sending and receiving media, allowing devices in calls to another
BUNDLE-supporting device to potentially avoid some of the above
costs.[¶](#section-7.1-2){.pilcrow}

While CLUE-capable devices [MAY]{.bcp14} support the BUNDLE extension
for this purpose, supporting the extension is not mandatory for a device
to be CLUE compliant.[¶](#section-7.1-3){.pilcrow}

A CLUE-capable device that supports BUNDLE [SHOULD]{.bcp14} also support
rtcp-mux \[[RFC5761](#RFC5761){.xref}\]. However, a CLUE-capable device

This specification imposes no additional requirements or restrictions on
the usage of BUNDLE when used with CLUE. There is no restriction on
combining CLUE-controlled media lines and non-CLUE-controlled media
lines in the same BUNDLE group or in multiple such groups. However,
there are several steps an implementation may wish to take to ameliorate
the cost and time requirements of extra SDP Offer/Answer exchanges

BUNDLE mandates that the initial SDP Offer [MUST]{.bcp14} use a unique
address for each \"m=\" line with a non-zero port. Because CLUE
implementations generally will not include CLUE-controlled media lines,
with the exception of the data channel in the initial SDP Offer, CLUE
devices that support large numbers of streams can avoid ever having to
open large numbers of ports if they successfully negotiate
BUNDLE.[¶](#section-7.2.1-1){.pilcrow}

An implementation that does include CLUE-controlled media lines in its
initial SDP Offer while also using BUNDLE must take care to avoid
rendering its CLUE-controlled media lines unusable in the event the far
end does not negotiate BUNDLE if it wishes to avoid the risk of
additional SDP exchanges to resolve this issue. This is best achieved by
not sending any CLUE-controlled media lines in an initial offer with the
\'bundle-only\' attribute unless it has been established via some other
channel that the recipient supports and is able to use
BUNDLE.[¶](#section-7.2.1-2){.pilcrow}

In SIP INVITE 1, Alice sends Bob a SIP INVITE with the basic audio and
video capabilities and data channel included in the SIP body as per
\[[RFC8841](#RFC8841){.xref}\]. Alice also includes the \"sip.clue\"
media feature tag in the INVITE. A snippet of the SDP showing the
grouping attribute and the video \"m=\" line are shown below. Alice has
included a \"CLUE\" group and the mid corresponding to a data channel in
the group (3). Note that Alice has chosen not to include any
CLUE-controlled media in the initial offer \-- the \"mid\" value of the
video line is not included in the \"CLUE\"
group.[¶](#section-8-4){.pilcrow}

Bob responds with a similar SDP in SIP 200 OK 1, which also has a
\"CLUE\" group including the \"mid\" value of a data channel; due to
their similarity, no SDP snippet is shown here. Bob wishes to receive
initial media and thus includes corresponding non-CLUE-controlled audio
and video lines. Bob also includes the \"sip.clue\" media feature tag in
the 200 OK. Alice and Bob are each now able to send a single audio and
video stream. This is illustrated as MEDIA 1.[¶](#section-8-6){.pilcrow}

With the successful initial SDP Offer/Answer exchange complete, Alice
and Bob are also free to negotiate the CLUE data channel. This is
illustrated as CLUE DATA CHANNEL ESTABLISHED.[¶](#section-8-7){.pilcrow}

Once the data channel is established, CLUE protocol negotiation begins.
In this case, Bob was the DTLS client (sending \"a=active\" in his SDP
Answer) and hence is the CLUE Channel Initiator. He sends a CLUE OPTIONS
message describing his version support. On receiving that message, Alice
sends her corresponding CLUE OPTIONS
RESPONSE.[¶](#section-8-8){.pilcrow}

With the OPTIONS phase complete, Alice now sends her CLUE
\'advertisement\' message (CLUE ADVERTISEMENT 1). She advertises three
static Captures representing her three cameras. She also includes
switched Captures suitable for systems with one or two screens. All of
these Captures are in a single Capture Scene, with suitable Capture
Scene Views that tell Bob he should subscribe to the three static
Captures, the two switched Captures, or the one switched Capture. Alice
has no simultaneity constraints, so all six Captures are included in one
simultaneous set. Finally, Alice includes an Encoding Group with three
Encoding IDs: \"enc1\", \"enc2\", and \"enc3\". These Encoding IDs
aren\'t currently valid but will match the next SDP Offer she
sends.[¶](#section-8-9){.pilcrow}

Bob received CLUE ADVERTISEMENT 1 but does not yet send a \'configure\'
message, because he has not yet received Alice\'s Encoding information;
thus, he does not know if she will have sufficient resources in order to
send him the two streams he ideally wants at a quality he is happy with.
Because Bob is not sending an immediate \'configure\' message with the
\"ack\" element set, he must send an explicit \'ack\' message (CLUE ACK
1) to signal receipt of CLUE ADVERTISEMENT
1.[¶](#section-8-10){.pilcrow}

Bob also sends his CLUE \'advertisement\' message (CLUE ADVERTISEMENT 2)
\-- though the diagram shows that this occurs after Alice sends CLUE
ADVERTISEMENT 1, Bob sends his \'advertisement\' message independently
and does not wait for CLUE ADVERTISEMENT 1 to arrive. He advertises two
static Captures representing his cameras. He also includes a single
composed Capture for single-screen systems, in which he will composite
the two camera views into a single video stream. All three Captures are
in a single Capture Scene, with suitable Capture Scene Views that tell
Alice she should subscribe to either the two static Captures or the
single composed Capture. Bob also has no simultaneity constraints, so he
includes all three Captures in one simultaneous set. Bob also includes a
single Encoding Group with two Encoding IDs: \"foo\" and
\"bar\".[¶](#section-8-11){.pilcrow}

Similarly, Alice receives CLUE ADVERTISEMENT 2 but does not yet send a
\'configure\' message, because she has not yet received Bob\'s Encoding
information; instead, she sends an \'ack\' message (CLUE ACK
2).[¶](#section-8-12){.pilcrow}

Both sides have now sent their CLUE \'advertisement\' messages, and an
SDP exchange is required to negotiate Encodings. For simplicity, in this
case, Alice is shown sending an INVITE with a new offer; in many
implementations, both sides might send an INVITE, which would be
resolved by use of the 491 Request Pending resolution mechanism from
\[[RFC3261](#RFC3261){.xref}\].[¶](#section-8-13){.pilcrow}

Alice now sends SIP INVITE 2. She maintains the sendrecv audio, video,
and CLUE \"m=\" lines, and she adds three new sendonly \"m=\" lines to
represent the three CLUE-controlled Encodings she can send. Each of
these \"m=\" lines has a label corresponding to one of the Encoding IDs
from CLUE ADVERTISEMENT 1. Each also has its mid added to the grouping
attribute to show they are controlled by the CLUE data channel. A
snippet of the SDP showing the grouping attribute, data channel, and
video \"m=\" lines are shown below:[¶](#section-8-14){.pilcrow}

Bob now has all the information he needs to decide which streams to
configure, allowing him to send both a CLUE \'configure\' message and
his SDP Answer. As such, he now sends CLUE CONFIGURE 1. This requests
the pair of switched Captures that represent Alice\'s scene, and he
configures them with encoder ids \"enc1\" and
\"enc2\".[¶](#section-8-16){.pilcrow}

original audio, video, and CLUE \"m=\" lines, he includes three
additional \"m=\" lines corresponding to the three added by Alice: two
active recvonly \"m= \"lines and an inactive \"m=\" line for the third.

## [11.](#section-11){.section-number .selfRef} [Security Considerations](#name-security-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-security-considerations}

CLUE makes use of a number of protocols and mechanisms, either defined
by CLUE or long-standing. The Security Considerations section of the
CLUE Framework document \[[RFC8845](#RFC8845){.xref}\] addresses the
need to secure these mechanisms by following the recommendations of the
individual protocols.[¶](#section-11-1){.pilcrow}

Beyond the need to secure the constituent protocols, the use of CLUE
does impose additional security concerns. One area of increased risk
involves the potential for a malicious party to subvert a CLUE-capable
device to attack a third party by driving large volumes of media
(particularly video) traffic at them by establishing a connection to the
CLUE-capable device and directing the media to the victim. While this is
a risk for all media devices, a CLUE-capable device may allow the
attacker to configure multiple media streams to be sent, significantly
increasing the volume of traffic directed at the
victim.[¶](#section-11-2){.pilcrow}

This attack can be prevented by ensuring that the media recipient
intends to receive the media packets. As such, all CLUE-capable devices
[MUST]{.bcp14} support key negotiation and receiver intent assurance via
DTLS / Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP)
\[[RFC5763](#RFC5763){.xref}\] on CLUE-controlled RTP \"m=\" lines, and
they [MUST]{.bcp14} use it or some other mechanism that provides
receiver intent assurance. All CLUE-controlled RTP \"m\" lines must be
secured and implemented using mechanisms such as SRTP
\[[RFC3711](#RFC3711){.xref}\]. CLUE implementations [MAY]{.bcp14}
choose not to require the use of SRTP to secure legacy
(non-CLUE-controlled) media for backwards compatibility with older SIP
clients that are incapable of supporting it.[¶](#section-11-3){.pilcrow}

CLUE also defines a new media feature tag that indicates CLUE support.
This tag may be present even in non-CLUE calls, which increases the
metadata available about the sending device; this can help an attacker
differentiate between multiple devices and identify otherwise anonymized
users via the fingerprint of features their device supports. To prevent
this, SIP signaling used to set up CLUE sessions [SHOULD]{.bcp14} always
be encrypted using TLS
\[[RFC5630](#RFC5630){.xref}\].[¶](#section-11-4){.pilcrow}

The CLUE protocol also carries additional information that could be used
to help fingerprint a particular user or to identify the specific
version of software being used. The CLUE Framework
\[[RFC8847](#RFC8847){.xref}\] provides details about these issues and
how to mitigate them.[¶](#section-11-5){.pilcrow}
