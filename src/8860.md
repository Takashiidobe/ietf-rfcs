# Sending Multiple Types of Media in a Single RTP Session {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

This document specifies how an RTP session can contain RTP streams with
media from multiple media types such as audio, video, and text. This has
been restricted by the RTP specifications (RFCs 3550 and 3551), and thus
this document updates RFCs 3550 and 3551 to enable this behaviour for
applications that satisfy the applicability for using multiple media
types in a single RTP session.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

The Real-time Transport Protocol \[[RFC3550](#RFC3550){.xref}\] was
designed to use separate RTP sessions to transport different types of
media. This implies that different transport-layer flows are used for
different RTP streams. For example, a video conferencing application
might send audio and video traffic RTP flows on separate UDP ports. With
increased use of network address/port translation, firewalls, and other
middleboxes, it is, however, becoming difficult to establish multiple
transport-layer flows between endpoints. Hence, there is pressure to
reduce the number of concurrent transport flows used by RTP
applications.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

This memo updates \[[RFC3550](#RFC3550){.xref}\] and
\[[RFC3551](#RFC3551){.xref}\] to allow multiple media types to be sent
in a single RTP session in certain cases, thereby reducing the number of
transport-layer flows that are needed. It makes no changes to RTP
behaviour when using multiple RTP streams containing media of the same
type (e.g., multiple audio streams or multiple video streams) in a
single RTP session. However, \[[RFC8108](#RFC8108){.xref}\] provides
important clarifications to RTP behaviour in that
case.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

This memo is structured as follows. [Section 2](#sec_defn){.xref}

the base RTP and RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) specifications
\[[RFC3550](#RFC3550){.xref}\] \[[RFC3551](#RFC3551){.xref}\] when using
multiple types of media in a single RTP session, while [Section
6](#sec_extn){.xref} considers the impact of RTP extensions. We discuss
signalling in [Section 7](#sec_sig){.xref}. Finally, security
considerations are discussed in [Section

## [3.](#section-3){.section-number .selfRef} [Background and Motivation](#name-background-and-motivation){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-background-and-motivation}

RTP was designed to support multimedia sessions, containing multiple
types of media sent simultaneously, by using multiple transport-layer
flows. The existence of network address translators, firewalls, and
other middleboxes complicates this, however, since a mechanism is needed
to ensure that all the transport-layer flows needed by the application
can be established. This has three
consequences:[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

1.  [increased delay to establish a complete session, since each of the
    transport-layer flows needs to be negotiated and
    established;[¶](#section-3-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-2.1}
2.  [increased state and resource consumption in the middleboxes that
    can lead to unexpected behaviour when middlebox resource limits are
    reached; and[¶](#section-3-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-2.2}
3.  [increased risk that a subset of the transport-layer flows will fail
    to be established, thus preventing the application from
    communicating.[¶](#section-3-2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-2.3}

Using fewer transport-layer flows can hence be seen to reduce the risk
of communication failure and can lead to improved reliability and
performance.[¶](#section-3-3){.pilcrow}

One of the benefits of using multiple transport-layer flows is that it
makes it easy to use network-layer QoS mechanisms to give differentiated
performance for different flows. However, we note that many applications
that use RTP don\'t use network QoS features and don\'t expect or desire
any separation in network treatment of their media packets, independent
of whether they are audio, video, or text. When an application has no
such desire, it doesn\'t need to provide a transport flow structure that
simplifies flow-based QoS.[¶](#section-3-4){.pilcrow}

Given the above issues, it might seem appropriate for RTP-based
applications to send all their RTP streams bundled into one RTP session,
running over a single transport-layer flow. However, this is prohibited
by the RTP specifications \[[RFC3550](#RFC3550){.xref}\]
\[[RFC3551](#RFC3551){.xref}\], because the design of RTP makes certain
assumptions that can be incompatible with sending multiple media types
in a single RTP session. Specifically, the RTCP timing rules assume that
all RTP media flows in a single RTP session have broadly similar RTCP
reporting and feedback requirements, which can be problematic when
different types of media are multiplexed together. Various RTP
extensions also make assumptions about Synchronisation Source (SSRC) use
and RTCP reporting that are incompatible with sending different media
types in a single RTP session.[¶](#section-3-5){.pilcrow}

This memo updates \[[RFC3550](#RFC3550){.xref}\] and
\[[RFC3551](#RFC3551){.xref}\] to allow RTP sessions to contain more
than one media type in certain circumstances and gives guidance on when
it is safe to send multiple media types in a single RTP
session.[¶](#section-3-6){.pilcrow}

This specification has limited applicability, and anyone intending to
use it needs to ensure that their application and use case meet the
following criteria:[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

Equal treatment of media:
:   The use of a single RTP session normally results in similar network
    treatment for all types of media used within the session.
    Applications that require significantly different network QoS or
    RTCP configuration for different RTP streams are better suited to
    sending those RTP streams in separate RTP sessions, using separate
    transport-layer flows for each, since that method provides greater
    flexibility. Further guidance on how to provide differential
    treatment for some media streams is given in
    \[[RFC8872](#RFC8872){.xref}\] and
    \[[RFC7657](#RFC7657){.xref}\].[¶](#section-4-2.2){.pilcrow}
:   

Compatible RTCP behaviour:
:   The RTCP timing rules enforce a single RTCP reporting interval for
    all participants in an RTP session. Flows with very different media
    sending rates or RTCP feedback requirements cannot be multiplexed
    together, since this leads to either excessive or insufficient RTCP
    for some flows, depending on how the RTCP session bandwidth, and
    hence the reporting interval, are configured. For example, it is
    likely infeasible to find a single RTCP configuration that
    simultaneously suits both a low-rate audio flow with no feedback and
    a high-quality video flow with sophisticated RTCP-based feedback.
    Thus, combining these into a single RTP session is difficult and/or
    inadvisable.[¶](#section-4-2.4){.pilcrow}
:   

Signalled support:
:   The extensions defined in this memo are not compatible with
    unmodified endpoints that are compatible with
    \[[RFC3550](#RFC3550){.xref}\]. Their use requires signalling and
    mutual agreement by all participants within an RTP session. This
    requirement can be a problem for signalling solutions that can\'t
    negotiate with all participants. For declarative signalling
    solutions, mandating that the session use multiple media types in
    one RTP session can be a way of attempting to ensure that all
    participants in the RTP session follow the requirement. However, for
    signalling solutions that lack methods for enforcing a requirement
    that a receiver support a specific feature, this can still cause
    issues.[¶](#section-4-2.6){.pilcrow}
:   

Consistent support for multiparty RTP sessions:

:   If it is desired to send multiple types of media in a multiparty RTP
    session, then all participants in that session need to support
    sending multiple types of media in a single RTP session. It is not
    possible, in the general case, to implement a gateway that can
    interconnect an endpoint that uses multiple types of media sent
    using separate RTP sessions with one or more endpoints that send
    multiple types of media in a single RTP
    session.[¶](#section-4-2.8.1){.pilcrow}

    One reason for this is that the same SSRC value can safely be used
    for different streams in multiple RTP sessions, but when collapsed
    to a single RTP session there is an SSRC collision. This would not
    be an issue, since SSRC collision detection will resolve the
    conflict, except that some RTP payload formats and extensions use
    matching SSRCs to identify related flows and will break when a
    single RTP session is used.[¶](#section-4-2.8.2){.pilcrow}

    A middlebox that remaps SSRC values when combining multiple RTP
    sessions into one also needs to be aware of all possible RTCP packet
    types that might be used, so that it can remap the SSRC values in
    those packets. This is impossible to do without restricting the set
    of RTCP packet types that can be used to those that are known by the
    middlebox. Such a middlebox might also have difficulty due to
    differences in configured RTCP bandwidth and other parameters
    between the RTP sessions.[¶](#section-4-2.8.3){.pilcrow}

    Finally, the use of a middlebox that translates SSRC values can
    negatively impact the possibility of loop detection, as SSRC/CSRC
    (Contributing Source) can\'t be used to detect the loops; instead,
    some other RTP stream or media source identity namespace that is
    common across all interconnected parts is
    needed.[¶](#section-4-2.8.4){.pilcrow}

:   

Ability to operate with limited payload type space:
:   An RTP session has only a single 7-bit payload type space for all
    its payload type numbers. Some applications might find this space to
    be limiting (i.e., overly restrictive) when using different media
    types and RTP payload formats within a single RTP
    session.[¶](#section-4-2.10){.pilcrow}
:   

Avoidance of incompatible extensions:
:   Some RTP and RTCP extensions rely on the existence of multiple RTP
    sessions and relate RTP streams between sessions. Others report on
    particular media types and cannot be used with other media types.
    Applications that send multiple types of media into a single RTP
    session need to avoid such extensions.[¶](#section-4-2.12){.pilcrow}

\"RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications\"
\[[RFC3550](#RFC3550){.xref}\] states:[¶](#section-5.1-1){.pilcrow}

> For example, in a teleconference composed of audio and video media
> encoded separately, each medium [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be carried in a

> Separate audio and video streams [SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} be carried in a

> fields.[¶](#section-5.1-2.2){.pilcrow}

This specification changes both of these sentences. The first sentence
is changed to:[¶](#section-5.1-3){.pilcrow}

> For example, in a teleconference composed of audio and video media
> encoded separately, each medium [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be carried in a

> Separate audio and video media sources [SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} be carried
> in a single RTP session, unless the guidelines specified in
> \[RFC8860\] are followed.[¶](#section-5.1-6){.pilcrow}

The second paragraph of [Section
6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3551#section-6){.relref} of \"RTP
Profile for Audio and Video Conferences with Minimal Control\"
\[[RFC3551](#RFC3551){.xref}\] says:[¶](#section-5.1-7){.pilcrow}

> The payload types currently defined in this profile are assigned to

This specification\'s purpose is to override the above-listed
\"[SHALL NOT]{.bcp14}\" under certain conditions. Thus, this sentence
also has to be changed to allow for multiple media types\' payload types
in the same session. The sentence containing \"[SHALL NOT]{.bcp14}\" in
the above paragraph is changed to:[¶](#section-5.1-9){.pilcrow}

When receiving packets from a transport-layer flow, an endpoint will
first separate the RTP and RTCP packets from the non-RTP packets and
pass them to the RTP/RTCP protocol handler. The RTP and RTCP packets are
then demultiplexed into the different RTP streams based on their SSRC.
For each RTP stream, incoming RTCP packets are processed, and the RTP
payload type is used to select the appropriate media decoder. This
process remains the same irrespective of whether multiple media types
are sent in a single RTP session or not.[¶](#section-5.2-1){.pilcrow}

As explained below, it is important to note that the RTP payload type is
never used to distinguish RTP streams. The RTP packets are demultiplexed
into RTP streams based on their SSRC; the RTP payload type is then used
to select the correct media-decoding pathway for each RTP
stream.[¶](#section-5.2-2){.pilcrow}

An SSRC in an RTP session can change between media formats of the same
type, subject to certain restrictions \[[RFC7160](#RFC7160){.xref}\],
but [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} change its media type during its lifetime. For
example, an SSRC can change between different audio formats, but it
cannot start sending audio and then change to sending video. The
lifetime of an SSRC ends when an RTCP BYE packet for that SSRC is sent
or when it ceases transmission for long enough that it times out for the
other participants in the session.[¶](#section-5.3-1){.pilcrow}

The main motivation is that a given SSRC has its own RTP timestamp and
sequence number spaces. The same way that you can\'t send two encoded
streams of audio with the same SSRC, you can\'t send one encoded audio
and one encoded video stream with the same SSRC. Each encoded stream,
when made into an RTP stream, needs to have sole control over the
sequence number and timestamp space. If not, one would not be able to
detect packet loss for that particular encoded stream, nor could one
easily determine which clock rate a particular SSRC\'s timestamp will
increase with. For additional arguments regarding why multiplexing of
multiple media sources that is based on RTP payload type doesn\'t work,
see \[[RFC8872](#RFC8872){.xref}\].[¶](#section-5.3-2){.pilcrow}

Within an RTP session where multiple media types have been configured
for use, an SSRC can only send one type of media during its lifetime
(i.e., it can switch between different audio codecs, since those are
both the same type of media, but it cannot switch between audio and
video). Different SSRCs [MUST]{.bcp14} be used for the different media
sources, the same way multiple media sources of the same media type
already have to do. The payload type will inform a receiver which media
type the SSRC is being used for. Thus, the payload type [MUST]{.bcp14}
be unique across all of the payload configurations, independent of the
media type that is used in the RTP session.[¶](#section-5.3-3){.pilcrow}

### [6.1.](#section-6.1){.section-number .selfRef} [RTP Retransmission Payload Format](#name-rtp-retransmission-payload-){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-rtp-retransmission-payload-}

The RTP retransmission payload format \[[RFC4588](#RFC4588){.xref}\] can
operate in either SSRC-multiplexed mode or session-multiplexed
mode.[¶](#section-6.1-1){.pilcrow}

In SSRC-multiplexed mode, retransmitted RTP packets are sent in the same
RTP session as the original packets but use a different SSRC with the
same RTCP Source Description (SDES) CNAME. If each endpoint sends only a
single original RTP stream and a single retransmission RTP stream in the
session, this is sufficient. If an endpoint sends multiple original and
retransmission RTP streams, as would occur when sending multiple media
types in a single RTP session, then each original RTP stream and the
retransmission RTP stream have to be associated using heuristics. By
having retransmission requests outstanding for only one SSRC not yet
mapped, a receiver can determine the binding between the original and
retransmission RTP streams. Another alternative is the use of different
RTP payload types, allowing the signalled \"apt\" (associated payload
type) parameter \[[RFC4588](#RFC4588){.xref}\] of the RTP retransmission
payload format to be used to associate retransmitted and original
packets.[¶](#section-6.1-2){.pilcrow}

Session-multiplexed mode sends the retransmission RTP stream in a
separate RTP session to the original RTP stream, but using the same SSRC
for each, with the association being done by matching SSRCs between the
two sessions. This is unaffected by the use of multiple media types in a
single RTP session, since each media type will be sent using a different
SSRC in the original RTP session, and the same SSRCs can be used in the
retransmission session, allowing the streams to be associated. This can
be signalled using SDP with the BUNDLE grouping extension
\[[RFC8843](#RFC8843){.xref}\] and the Flow Identification (FID)
grouping extension \[[RFC5888](#RFC5888){.xref}\]. These SDP extensions
require each \"m=\" line to only be included in a single FID group, but
the RTP retransmission payload format uses FID groups to indicate the
\"m=\" lines that form an original and retransmission pair. Accordingly,
when using the BUNDLE extension to allow multiple media types to be sent
in a single RTP session, each original media source (\"m=\" line) that
is retransmitted needs a corresponding \"m=\" line in the retransmission
RTP session. If there are multiple media lines for retransmission, these
media lines will form an independent BUNDLE group from the BUNDLE group
with the source streams.[¶](#section-6.1-3){.pilcrow}

An example SDP fragment showing the grouping structures is provided in
[Figure 1](#fig-rtx-session){.xref}. This example is not legal SDP, and
only the most important attributes have been left in place. Note that
this SDP is not an initial BUNDLE offer. As can be seen in this example,
there are two bundle groups \-- one for the source RTP session and one
for the retransmissions. Then, each of the media sources is grouped with
its retransmission flow using FID, resulting in three more
groupings.[¶](#section-6.1-4){.pilcrow}

### [6.2.](#section-6.2){.section-number .selfRef} [RTP Payload Format for Generic FEC](#name-rtp-payload-format-for-gene){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-rtp-payload-format-for-gene}

The RTP payload format for generic Forward Error Correction (FEC), as
defined in \[[RFC5109](#RFC5109){.xref}\] (and its predecessor,
\[[RFC2733](#RFC2733){.xref}\]), can either send the FEC stream as a
separate RTP stream or send the FEC combined with the original RTP
stream as a redundant encoding
\[[RFC2198](#RFC2198){.xref}\].[¶](#section-6.2-1){.pilcrow}

When sending FEC as a separate stream, the RTP payload format for
generic FEC requires that FEC stream to be sent in a separate RTP
session to the original stream, using the same SSRC, with the FEC stream
being associated by matching the SSRC between sessions. The RTP session
used for the original streams can include multiple RTP streams, and
those RTP streams can use multiple media types. The repair session only
needs one RTP payload type to indicate FEC data, irrespective of the
number of FEC streams sent, since the SSRC is used to associate the FEC
streams with the original streams. Hence, it is [RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14}
that the FEC stream use the \"application/ulpfec\" media type in the
case of support for \[[RFC5109](#RFC5109){.xref}\] and the
\"application/⁠parityfec\" media type in the case of support for
\[[RFC2733](#RFC2733){.xref}\]. It is legal, but [NOT
RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14}, to send FEC streams using media-specific payload
format names (e.g., using both the \"audio/ulpfec\" and \"video/ulpfec\"
payload formats for a single RTP session containing both audio and video
flows), since this (1) unnecessarily uses up RTP payload type values and
(2) adds no value for demultiplexing because there might be multiple
streams of the same media type).[¶](#section-6.2-2){.pilcrow}

The combination of an original RTP session using multiple media types
with an associated generic FEC session can be signalled using SDP with
the BUNDLE extension \[[RFC8843](#RFC8843){.xref}\]. In this case, the
RTP session carrying the FEC streams will be its own BUNDLE group. The
\"m=\" line for each original stream and the \"m=\" line for the
corresponding FEC stream are grouped using the SDP Grouping Framework,
using either the [FEC-FR grouping](#RFC5956){.xref}
\[[RFC5956](#RFC5956){.xref}\] or, for backwards compatibility, the FEC
grouping \[[RFC4756](#RFC4756){.xref}\]. This is similar to the
situation that arises for RTP retransmission with session-based
multiplexing as discussed in [Section
6.1](#sec-rtx){.xref}.[¶](#section-6.2-3){.pilcrow}

The [source-specific media attributes specification](#RFC5576){.xref}
\[[RFC5576](#RFC5576){.xref}\] defines an SDP extension (the \"FEC\"
semantic of the \"ssrc-group\" attribute) to signal FEC relationships
between multiple RTP streams within a single RTP session. This cannot be
used with generic FEC, since the FEC repair packets need to have the
same SSRC value as the source packets being protected. There existed a
proposal (now abandoned) for an Uneven Level Protection (ULP) extension
to enable transmission of the FEC RTP streams within the same RTP
session as the source stream
\[[FEC-Src-Multiplexing](#I-D.lennox-payload-ulp-ssrc-mux){.xref}\].[¶](#section-6.2-4){.pilcrow}

When the FEC is sent as a redundant encoding, the considerations in
[Section 6.3](#sec-red){.xref} apply.[¶](#section-6.2-5){.pilcrow}

### [6.3.](#section-6.3){.section-number .selfRef} [RTP Payload Format for Redundant Audio](#name-rtp-payload-format-for-redu){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-rtp-payload-format-for-redu}

The RTP payload format for redundant audio
\[[RFC2198](#RFC2198){.xref}\] can be used to protect audio streams. It
can also be used along with the generic FEC payload format to send
original and repair data in the same RTP packets. Both are compatible
with RTP sessions containing multiple media
types.[¶](#section-6.3-1){.pilcrow}

This payload format requires each different redundant encoding to use a
different RTP payload type number. When used with generic FEC in
sessions that contain multiple media types, this requires each media
type to use a different payload type for the FEC stream. For example, if
audio and text are sent in a single RTP session with generic ULP FEC
sent as a redundant encoding for each, then payload types need to be
assigned for FEC using the audio/ulpfec and text/⁠ulpfec payload
formats. If multiple original payload types are used in the session,
different redundant payload types need to be allocated for each one.
This has potential to rapidly exhaust the available RTP payload type
numbers.[¶](#section-6.3-2){.pilcrow}

## [8.](#section-8){.section-number .selfRef} [Security Considerations](#name-security-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-security-considerations}

RTP provides a range of strong security mechanisms that can be used to
secure sessions \[[RFC7201](#RFC7201){.xref}\]
\[[RFC7202](#RFC7202){.xref}\]. The majority of these are independent of
the type of media sent in the RTP session; however, it is important to
check that the security mechanism chosen is compatible with all types of
media sent within the session.[¶](#section-8-1){.pilcrow}

Sending multiple media types in a single RTP session will generally
require that all use the same security mechanism, whereas media sent
using different RTP sessions can be secured in different ways. When
different media types have different security requirements, it might be
necessary to send them using separate RTP sessions to meet those
different requirements. This can have significant costs in terms of
resource usage, session setup time, etc.[¶](#section-8-2){.pilcrow}
