# RFC 9297 {#rfcnum}

# HTTP Datagrams and the Capsule Protocol {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

This document describes HTTP Datagrams, a convention for conveying
multiplexed, potentially unreliable datagrams inside an HTTP
connection.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

In HTTP/3, HTTP Datagrams can be sent unreliably using the QUIC DATAGRAM
extension. When the QUIC DATAGRAM frame is unavailable or undesirable,
HTTP Datagrams can be sent using the Capsule Protocol, which is a more
general convention for conveying data in HTTP
connections.[¶](#section-abstract-2){.pilcrow}

HTTP Datagrams and the Capsule Protocol are intended for use by HTTP
extensions, not applications.[¶](#section-abstract-3){.pilcrow}

HTTP extensions (as defined in [Section
16](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-16){.relref} of
\[[HTTP](#RFC9110){.xref}\]) sometimes need to access underlying
transport protocol features such as unreliable delivery (as offered by
\[[QUIC-DGRAM](#RFC9221){.xref}\]) to enable desirable features. For
example, this could allow for the introduction of an unreliable version
of the CONNECT method and the addition of unreliable delivery to
WebSockets \[[WEBSOCKET](#RFC6455){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

In [Section 2](#datagrams){.xref}, this document describes HTTP
Datagrams, a convention for conveying bidirectional and potentially
unreliable datagrams inside an HTTP connection, with multiplexing when
possible. While HTTP Datagrams are associated with HTTP requests, they
are not a part of message content. Instead, they are intended for use by
HTTP extensions (such as the CONNECT method) and are compatible with all
versions of HTTP.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

When HTTP is running over a transport protocol that supports unreliable
delivery (such as when the QUIC DATAGRAM extension
\[[QUIC-DGRAM](#RFC9221){.xref}\] is available to HTTP/3
\[[HTTP/3](#RFC9114){.xref}\]), HTTP Datagrams can use that
capability.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

In [Section 3](#capsule){.xref}, this document describes the HTTP
Capsule Protocol, which allows the conveyance of HTTP Datagrams using
reliable delivery. This addresses HTTP/3 cases where use of the QUIC
DATAGRAM frame is unavailable or undesirable or where the transport
protocol only provides reliable delivery, such as with HTTP/1.1
\[[HTTP/1.1](#RFC9112){.xref}\] or HTTP/2 \[[HTTP/2](#RFC9113){.xref}\]
over TCP \[[TCP](#RFC9293){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

\[[QUIC](#RFC9000){.xref}\]. Where fields within types are integers,
they are encoded using the variable-length integer encoding from
[Section 16](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9000#section-16){.relref}
of \[[QUIC](#RFC9000){.xref}\]. Integer values do not need to be encoded
on the minimum number of bytes necessary.[¶](#section-1.1-3){.pilcrow}

In this document, the term \"intermediary\" refers to an HTTP
intermediary as defined in [Section

## [2.](#section-2){.section-number .selfRef} [HTTP Datagrams](#name-http-datagrams){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-http-datagrams}

HTTP Datagrams are a convention for conveying bidirectional and
potentially unreliable datagrams inside an HTTP connection with
multiplexing when possible. All HTTP Datagrams are associated with an
HTTP request.[¶](#section-2-1){.pilcrow}

When HTTP Datagrams are conveyed on an HTTP/3 connection, the QUIC
DATAGRAM frame can be used to provide demultiplexing and unreliable
delivery; see [Section 2.1](#format){.xref}. Negotiating the use of QUIC
DATAGRAM frames for HTTP Datagrams is achieved via the exchange of
HTTP/3 settings; see [Section
2.1.1](#setting){.xref}.[¶](#section-2-2){.pilcrow}

When running over HTTP/2, demultiplexing is provided by the HTTP/2
framing layer, but unreliable delivery is unavailable. HTTP Datagrams
are negotiated and conveyed using the Capsule Protocol; see [Section
3.5](#datagram-capsule){.xref}.[¶](#section-2-3){.pilcrow}

When running over HTTP/1.x, requests are strictly serialized in the
connection; therefore, demultiplexing is not available. Unreliable
delivery is likewise not available. HTTP Datagrams are negotiated and
conveyed using the Capsule Protocol; see [Section
3.5](#datagram-capsule){.xref}.[¶](#section-2-4){.pilcrow}

HTTP Datagrams [MUST]{.bcp14} only be sent with an association to an
HTTP request that explicitly supports them. For example, existing HTTP
methods GET and POST do not define semantics for associated HTTP
Datagrams; therefore, HTTP Datagrams associated with GET or POST request
streams cannot be sent.[¶](#section-2-5){.pilcrow}

If an HTTP Datagram is received and it is associated with a request that
has no known semantics for HTTP Datagrams, the receiver [MUST]{.bcp14}
terminate the request. If HTTP/3 is in use, the request stream
[MUST]{.bcp14} be aborted with H3_DATAGRAM_ERROR (0x33). HTTP extensions
[MAY]{.bcp14} override these requirements by defining a negotiation
mechanism and semantics for HTTP Datagrams.[¶](#section-2-6){.pilcrow}

When used with HTTP/3, the Datagram Data field of QUIC DATAGRAM frames
uses the following format:[¶](#section-2.1-1){.pilcrow}

[]{#name-http-3-datagram-format}

::: {#h3-datagram-format}

:::

[Figure 1](#figure-1){.selfRef}: [HTTP/3 Datagram
Format](#name-http-3-datagram-format){.selfRef}
:::

[]{.break}

Quarter Stream ID:

:   A variable-length integer that contains the value of the
    client-initiated bidirectional stream that this datagram is
    associated with divided by four (the division by four stems from the
    fact that HTTP requests are sent on client-initiated bidirectional
    streams, which have stream IDs that are divisible by four). The
    largest legal QUIC stream ID value is 2^62^-1, so the largest legal
    value of the Quarter Stream ID field is 2^60^-1. Receipt of an
    HTTP/3 Datagram that includes a larger value [MUST]{.bcp14} be
    treated as an HTTP/3 connection error of type H3_DATAGRAM_ERROR
    (0x33).[¶](#section-2.1-3.2.1){.pilcrow}

:   

HTTP Datagram Payload:

:   The payload of the datagram, whose semantics are defined by the
    extension that is using HTTP Datagrams. Note that this field can be
    empty.[¶](#section-2.1-3.4.1){.pilcrow}

:   

Receipt of a QUIC DATAGRAM frame whose payload is too short to allow
parsing the Quarter Stream ID field [MUST]{.bcp14} be treated as an
HTTP/3 connection error of type H3_DATAGRAM_ERROR
(0x33).[¶](#section-2.1-4){.pilcrow}

HTTP/3 Datagrams [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be sent unless the corresponding
stream\'s send side is open. If a datagram is received after the
corresponding stream\'s receive side is closed, the received datagrams
[MUST]{.bcp14} be silently dropped.[¶](#section-2.1-5){.pilcrow}

If an HTTP/3 Datagram is received and its Quarter Stream ID field maps
to a stream that has not yet been created, the receiver [SHALL]{.bcp14}
either drop that datagram silently or buffer it temporarily (on the
order of a round trip) while awaiting the creation of the corresponding
stream.[¶](#section-2.1-6){.pilcrow}

If an HTTP/3 Datagram is received and its Quarter Stream ID field maps
to a stream that cannot be created due to client-initiated bidirectional
stream limits, it [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be treated as an HTTP/3 connection
error of type H3_ID_ERROR. Generating an error is not mandatory because
the QUIC stream limit might be unknown to the HTTP/3
layer.[¶](#section-2.1-7){.pilcrow}

Prioritization of HTTP/3 Datagrams is not defined in this document.
Future extensions [MAY]{.bcp14} define how to prioritize datagrams and
[MAY]{.bcp14} define signaling to allow communicating prioritization
preferences.[¶](#section-2.1-8){.pilcrow}

An endpoint can indicate to its peer that it is willing to receive
HTTP/3 Datagrams by sending the SETTINGS_H3_DATAGRAM (0x33) setting with
a value of 1.[¶](#section-2.1.1-1){.pilcrow}

The value of the SETTINGS_H3_DATAGRAM setting [MUST]{.bcp14} be either 0
or 1. A value of 0 indicates that the implementation is not willing to
receive HTTP Datagrams. If the SETTINGS_H3_DATAGRAM setting is received
with a value that is neither 0 nor 1, the receiver [MUST]{.bcp14}
terminate the connection with error
H3_SETTINGS_ERROR.[¶](#section-2.1.1-2){.pilcrow}

QUIC DATAGRAM frames [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be sent until the
SETTINGS_H3_DATAGRAM setting has been both sent and received with a
value of 1.[¶](#section-2.1.1-3){.pilcrow}

When clients use 0-RTT, they [MAY]{.bcp14} store the value of the
server\'s SETTINGS_H3_DATAGRAM setting. Doing so allows the client to
send QUIC DATAGRAM frames in 0-RTT packets. When servers decide to
accept 0-RTT data, they [MUST]{.bcp14} send a SETTINGS_H3_DATAGRAM
setting greater than or equal to the value they sent to the client in
the connection where they sent them the NewSessionTicket message. If a
client stores the value of the SETTINGS_H3_DATAGRAM setting with their
0-RTT state, they [MUST]{.bcp14} validate that the new value of the
SETTINGS_H3_DATAGRAM setting sent by the server in the handshake is
greater than or equal to the stored value; if not, the client
[MUST]{.bcp14} terminate the connection with error H3_SETTINGS_ERROR. In
all cases, the maximum permitted value of the SETTINGS_H3_DATAGRAM
setting parameter is 1.[¶](#section-2.1.1-4){.pilcrow}

It is [RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14} that implementations that support receiving
HTTP/3 Datagrams always send the SETTINGS_H3_DATAGRAM setting with a
value of 1, even if the application does not intend to use HTTP/3
Datagrams. This helps to avoid \"sticking out\"; see [Section
4](#security){.xref}.[¶](#section-2.1.1-5){.pilcrow}

One mechanism to extend HTTP is to introduce new HTTP upgrade tokens;
see [Section
16.7](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-16.7){.relref} of
\[[HTTP](#RFC9110){.xref}\]. In HTTP/1.x, these tokens are used via the
Upgrade mechanism; see [Section
7.8](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-7.8){.relref} of
\[[HTTP](#RFC9110){.xref}\]. In HTTP/2 and HTTP/3, these tokens are used
via the Extended CONNECT mechanism; see
\[[EXT-CONNECT2](#RFC8441){.xref}\] and
\[[EXT-CONNECT3](#RFC9220){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

This specification introduces the Capsule Protocol. The Capsule Protocol
is a sequence of type-length-value tuples that definitions of new HTTP
upgrade tokens can choose to use. It allows endpoints to reliably
communicate request-related information end-to-end on HTTP request
streams, even in the presence of HTTP intermediaries. The Capsule
Protocol can be used to exchange HTTP Datagrams, which is necessary when
HTTP is running over a transport that does not support the QUIC DATAGRAM
frame. The Capsule Protocol can also be used to communicate reliable and
bidirectional control messages associated with a datagram-based protocol
even when HTTP/3 Datagrams are in use.[¶](#section-3-2){.pilcrow}

### [3.1.](#section-3.1){.section-number .selfRef} [HTTP Data Streams](#name-http-data-streams){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-http-data-streams}

This specification defines the \"data stream\" of an HTTP request as the
bidirectional stream of bytes that follows the header section of the
request message and the final response message that is either successful
(i.e., 2xx) or upgraded (i.e., 101).[¶](#section-3.1-1){.pilcrow}

In HTTP/1.x, the data stream consists of all bytes on the connection
that follow the blank line that concludes either the request header
section or the final response header section. As a result, only the last
HTTP request on an HTTP/1.x connection can start the Capsule
Protocol.[¶](#section-3.1-2){.pilcrow}

In HTTP/2 and HTTP/3, the data stream of a given HTTP request consists
of all bytes sent in DATA frames with the corresponding stream
ID.[¶](#section-3.1-3){.pilcrow}

The concept of a data stream is particularly relevant for methods such
as CONNECT, where there is no HTTP message content after the
headers.[¶](#section-3.1-4){.pilcrow}

Data streams can be prioritized using any means suited to stream or
request prioritization. For example, see [Section
11](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9218#section-11){.relref} of
\[[PRIORITY](#RFC9218){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3.1-5){.pilcrow}

Data streams are subject to the flow control mechanisms of the
underlying layers; examples include HTTP/2 stream flow control, HTTP/2
connection flow control, and TCP flow
control.[¶](#section-3.1-6){.pilcrow}

request\'s data stream uses the Capsule Protocol. If they do so, the

Capsule Type:

:   A variable-length integer indicating the type of the capsule. An
    IANA registry is used to manage the assignment of Capsule Types; see
    [Section 5.4](#iana-types){.xref}.[¶](#section-3.2-4.2.1){.pilcrow}

:   

Capsule Length:

:   The length, in bytes, of the Capsule Value field, which follows this
    field, encoded as a variable-length integer. Note that this field
    can have a value of zero.[¶](#section-3.2-4.4.1){.pilcrow}

:   

Capsule Value:

:   The payload of this Capsule. Its semantics are determined by the
    value of the Capsule Type field.[¶](#section-3.2-4.6.1){.pilcrow}

:   

An intermediary can identify the use of the Capsule Protocol either
through the presence of the Capsule-Protocol header field ([Section
3.4](#hdr){.xref}) or by understanding the chosen HTTP Upgrade
token.[¶](#section-3.2-5){.pilcrow}

Because new protocols or extensions might define new Capsule Types,
intermediaries that wish to allow for future extensibility
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} forward Capsules without modification unless the
definition of the Capsule Type in use specifies additional intermediary
processing. One such Capsule Type is the DATAGRAM Capsule; see [Section
3.5](#datagram-capsule){.xref}. In particular, intermediaries
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} forward Capsules with an unknown Capsule Type without
modification.[¶](#section-3.2-6){.pilcrow}

Endpoints that receive a Capsule with an unknown Capsule Type
[MUST]{.bcp14} silently drop that Capsule and skip over it to parse the
next Capsule.[¶](#section-3.2-7){.pilcrow}

By virtue of the definition of the data
stream:[¶](#section-3.2-8){.pilcrow}

-   [The Capsule Protocol is not in use unless the response includes a
    2xx (Successful) or 101 (Switching Protocols) status
    code.[¶](#section-3.2-9.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.2-9.1}
-   [When the Capsule Protocol is in use, the associated HTTP request
    and response do not carry HTTP content. A future extension
    [MAY]{.bcp14} define a new Capsule Type to carry HTTP
    content.[¶](#section-3.2-9.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.2-9.2}

The Capsule Protocol only applies to definitions of new HTTP upgrade
tokens; thus, in HTTP/2 and HTTP/3, it can only be used with the CONNECT
method. Therefore, once both endpoints agree to use the Capsule
Protocol, the frame usage requirements of the stream change as specified
in [Section
8.5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9113#section-8.5){.relref} of
\[[HTTP/2](#RFC9113){.xref}\] and [Section
4.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9114#section-4.4){.relref} of
\[[HTTP/3](#RFC9114){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3.2-10){.pilcrow}

The Capsule Protocol [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be used with messages that
contain Content-Length, Content-Type, or Transfer-Encoding header
fields. Additionally, HTTP status codes 204 (No Content), 205 (Reset
Content), and 206 (Partial Content) [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be sent on
responses that use the Capsule Protocol. A receiver that observes a
violation of these requirements [MUST]{.bcp14} treat the HTTP message as
malformed.[¶](#section-3.2-11){.pilcrow}

When processing Capsules, a receiver might be tempted to accumulate the
full length of the Capsule Value field in the data stream before
handling it. This approach [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be avoided because it can
consume flow control in underlying layers, and that might lead to
deadlocks if the Capsule data exhausts the flow control
window.[¶](#section-3.2-12){.pilcrow}

### [3.3.](#section-3.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Error Handling](#name-error-handling){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-error-handling}

When a receiver encounters an error processing the Capsule Protocol, the
receiver [MUST]{.bcp14} treat it as if it had received a malformed or
incomplete HTTP message. For HTTP/3, the handling of malformed messages
is described in [Section
4.1.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9114#section-4.1.2){.relref} of
\[[HTTP/3](#RFC9114){.xref}\]. For HTTP/2, the handling of malformed
messages is described in [Section
8.1.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9113#section-8.1.1){.relref} of
\[[HTTP/2](#RFC9113){.xref}\]. For HTTP/1.x, the handling of incomplete
messages is described in [Section
8](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9112#section-8){.relref} of
\[[HTTP/1.1](#RFC9112){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3.3-1){.pilcrow}

Each Capsule\'s payload [MUST]{.bcp14} contain exactly the fields
identified in its description. A Capsule payload that contains
additional bytes after the identified fields or a Capsule payload that
terminates before the end of the identified fields [MUST]{.bcp14} be
treated as it if were a malformed or incomplete message. In particular,
redundant length encodings [MUST]{.bcp14} be verified to be
self-consistent.[¶](#section-3.3-2){.pilcrow}

If the receive side of a stream carrying Capsules is terminated cleanly
(for example, in HTTP/3 this is defined as receiving a QUIC STREAM frame
with the FIN bit set) and the last Capsule on the stream was truncated,
this [MUST]{.bcp14} be treated as if it were a malformed or incomplete
message.[¶](#section-3.3-3){.pilcrow}

The \"Capsule-Protocol\" header field is an Item Structured Field; see
[Section
3.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8941#section-3.3){.relref} of
\[[STRUCTURED-FIELDS](#RFC8941){.xref}\]. Its value [MUST]{.bcp14} be a
Boolean; any other value type [MUST]{.bcp14} be handled as if the field
were not present by recipients (for example, if this field is included
multiple times, its type will become a List and the field will be
ignored). This document does not define any parameters for the
Capsule-Protocol header field value, but future documents might define
parameters. Receivers [MUST]{.bcp14} ignore unknown
parameters.[¶](#section-3.4-1){.pilcrow}

Endpoints indicate that the Capsule Protocol is in use on a data stream
by sending a Capsule-Protocol header field with a true value. A
Capsule-Protocol header field with a false value has the same semantics
as when the header is not present.[¶](#section-3.4-2){.pilcrow}

Intermediaries [MAY]{.bcp14} use this header field to allow processing
of HTTP Datagrams for unknown HTTP upgrade tokens. Note that this is
only possible for HTTP Upgrade or Extended
CONNECT.[¶](#section-3.4-3){.pilcrow}

The Capsule-Protocol header field [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be used on HTTP
responses with a status code that is both different from 101 (Switching
Protocols) and outside the 2xx (Successful)
range.[¶](#section-3.4-4){.pilcrow}

When using the Capsule Protocol, HTTP endpoints [SHOULD]{.bcp14} send
the Capsule-Protocol header field to simplify intermediary processing.
Definitions of new HTTP upgrade tokens that use the Capsule Protocol
[MAY]{.bcp14} alter this recommendation.[¶](#section-3.4-5){.pilcrow}

This document defines the DATAGRAM (0x00) Capsule Type. This Capsule
allows HTTP Datagrams to be sent on a stream using the Capsule Protocol.
This is particularly useful when HTTP is running over a transport that
does not support the QUIC DATAGRAM frame.[¶](#section-3.5-1){.pilcrow}

HTTP Datagram Payload:

:   The payload of the datagram, whose semantics are defined by the
    extension that is using HTTP Datagrams. Note that this field can be
    empty.[¶](#section-3.5-3.2.1){.pilcrow}

:   

HTTP Datagrams sent using the DATAGRAM Capsule have the same semantics
as those sent in QUIC DATAGRAM frames. In particular, the restrictions
on when it is allowed to send an HTTP Datagram and how to process them
(from [Section 2.1](#format){.xref}) also apply to HTTP Datagrams sent
and received using the DATAGRAM Capsule.[¶](#section-3.5-4){.pilcrow}

An intermediary can re-encode HTTP Datagrams as it forwards them. In
other words, an intermediary [MAY]{.bcp14} send a DATAGRAM Capsule to
forward an HTTP Datagram that was received in a QUIC DATAGRAM frame and
vice versa. Intermediaries [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} perform this re-encoding
unless they have identified the use of the Capsule Protocol on the
corresponding request stream; see [Section
3.2](#capsule-protocol){.xref}.[¶](#section-3.5-5){.pilcrow}

Note that while DATAGRAM Capsules, which are sent on a stream, are
reliably delivered in order, intermediaries can re-encode DATAGRAM
Capsules into QUIC DATAGRAM frames when forwarding messages, which could
result in loss or reordering.[¶](#section-3.5-6){.pilcrow}

If an intermediary receives an HTTP Datagram in a QUIC DATAGRAM frame
and is forwarding it on a connection that supports QUIC DATAGRAM frames,
the intermediary [SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} convert that HTTP Datagram to a
DATAGRAM Capsule. If the HTTP Datagram is too large to fit in a DATAGRAM
frame (for example, because the Path MTU (PMTU) of that QUIC connection
is too low or if the maximum UDP payload size advertised on that
connection is too low), the intermediary [SHOULD]{.bcp14} drop the HTTP
Datagram instead of converting it to a DATAGRAM Capsule. This preserves
the end-to-end unreliability characteristic that methods such as
Datagram Packetization Layer PMTU Discovery (DPLPMTUD) depend on
\[[DPLPMTUD](#RFC8899){.xref}\]. An intermediary that converts QUIC
DATAGRAM frames to DATAGRAM Capsules allows HTTP Datagrams to be
arbitrarily large without suffering any loss. This can misrepresent the
true path properties, defeating methods such as
DPLPMTUD.[¶](#section-3.5-7){.pilcrow}

While DATAGRAM Capsules can theoretically carry a payload of length
2^62^-1, most HTTP extensions that use HTTP Datagrams will have their
own limits on what datagram payload sizes are practical. Implementations
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} take those limits into account when parsing DATAGRAM
Capsules. If an incoming DATAGRAM Capsule has a length that is known to
be so large as to not be usable, the implementation [SHOULD]{.bcp14}
discard the Capsule without buffering its contents into
memory.[¶](#section-3.5-8){.pilcrow}

Since QUIC DATAGRAM frames are required to fit within a QUIC packet,
implementations that re-encode DATAGRAM Capsules into QUIC DATAGRAM
frames might be tempted to accumulate the entire Capsule in the stream
before re-encoding it. This [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be avoided, because it can
cause flow control problems; see [Section
3.2](#capsule-protocol){.xref}.[¶](#section-3.5-9){.pilcrow}

Note that it is possible for an HTTP extension to use HTTP Datagrams
without using the Capsule Protocol. For example, if an HTTP extension
that uses HTTP Datagrams is only defined over transports that support
QUIC DATAGRAM frames, it might not need a stream encoding. Additionally,
HTTP extensions can use HTTP Datagrams with their own data stream
protocol. However, new HTTP extensions that wish to use HTTP Datagrams
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} use the Capsule Protocol, as failing to do so will make
it harder for the HTTP extension to support versions of HTTP other than
HTTP/3 and will prevent interoperability with intermediaries that only
support the Capsule Protocol.[¶](#section-3.5-10){.pilcrow}

## [4.](#section-4){.section-number .selfRef} [Security Considerations](#name-security-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-security-considerations}

Since transmitting HTTP Datagrams using QUIC DATAGRAM frames requires
sending the HTTP/3 SETTINGS_H3_DATAGRAM setting, it \"sticks out\". In
other words, probing clients can learn whether a server supports HTTP
Datagrams over QUIC DATAGRAM frames. As some servers might wish to
obfuscate the fact that they offer application services that use HTTP
Datagrams, it\'s best for all implementations that support this feature
to always send this setting; see [Section
2.1.1](#setting){.xref}.[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

Since use of the Capsule Protocol is restricted to new HTTP upgrade
tokens, it is not directly accessible from Web Platform APIs (such as
those commonly accessed via JavaScript in web
browsers).[¶](#section-4-2){.pilcrow}

Definitions of new HTTP upgrade tokens that use the Capsule Protocol
need to include a security analysis that considers the impact of HTTP
Datagrams and Capsules in the context of their
protocol.[¶](#section-4-3){.pilcrow}
