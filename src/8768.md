## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

The presence of Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) proxies may lead
to infinite forwarding loops, which is undesirable. To prevent and
detect such loops, this document specifies the Hop-Limit CoAP
option.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

More and more applications are using the Constrained Application
Protocol (CoAP) \[[RFC7252](#RFC7252){.xref}\] as a communication
protocol between application agents. For example,
\[[DOTS-SIG-CHANNEL](#I-D.ietf-dots-signal-channel){.xref}\] specifies
how CoAP is used as a signaling protocol between domains under
distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and DDoS mitigation
providers. In such contexts, a CoAP client can communicate directly with
a server or indirectly via proxies.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

When multiple proxies are involved, infinite forwarding loops may be
experienced (e.g., routing misconfiguration, policy conflicts). To
prevent such loops, this document defines a new CoAP option, called
Hop-Limit ([Section 3](#spec){.xref}). Also, the document defines a new
CoAP Response Code ([Section 6.1](#code){.xref}) to report loops
together with relevant diagnostic information to ease troubleshooting
([Section 4](#debug){.xref}).[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-1.1 .section}
### [1.1.](#section-1.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Intended Usage](#name-intended-usage){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-intended-usage}

The Hop-Limit option was originally designed for a specific use case
\[[DOTS-SIG-CHANNEL](#I-D.ietf-dots-signal-channel){.xref}\]. However,
its intended usage is general:[¶](#section-1.1-1){.pilcrow}

-   [New CoAP proxies [MUST]{.bcp14} implement this option and have it
    enabled by
    default.[¶](#section-1.1-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-1.1-2.1}

Note that this means that a server that receives requests both via
proxies and directly from clients may see otherwise identical requests
with and without the Hop-Limit option included; servers with internal
caching will therefore also want to implement this option, since
understanding the Hop-Limit option will improve caching
efficiency.[¶](#section-1.1-3){.pilcrow}

:::

The Hop-Limit option ([Section 6.2](#option){.xref}) is an elective
option used to detect and prevent infinite loops of CoAP requests when
proxies are involved. The option is not repeatable. Therefore, any
request carrying multiple Hop-Limit options [MUST]{.bcp14} be handled
following the procedure specified in [Section
5.4.5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7252#section-5.4.5){.relref} of
\[[RFC7252](#RFC7252){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3-3){.pilcrow}

The value of the Hop-Limit option is encoded as an unsigned integer (see
[Section
3.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7252#section-3.2){.relref} of
\[[RFC7252](#RFC7252){.xref}\]). This value [MUST]{.bcp14} be between 1
and 255 inclusive. CoAP requests received with a Hop-Limit option set to
\'0\' or greater than \'255\' [MUST]{.bcp14} be rejected by a CoAP
server/proxy using 4.00 (Bad Request).[¶](#section-3-4){.pilcrow}

The Hop-Limit option is safe to forward. That is, a CoAP proxy that does
not understand the Hop-Limit option should forward it on. The option is
also part of the cache key. As such, a CoAP proxy that does not
understand the Hop-Limit option must follow the recommendations in
[Section
5.7.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7252#section-5.7.1){.relref} of
\[[RFC7252](#RFC7252){.xref}\] for caching. Note that loops that involve
only such proxies will not be detected. Nevertheless, the presence of
such proxies will not prevent infinite loop detection if at least one
CoAP proxy that supports the Hop-Limit option is involved in the
loop.[¶](#section-3-5){.pilcrow}

A CoAP proxy that understands the Hop-Limit option [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be
instructed, using a configuration parameter, to insert a Hop-Limit
option when relaying a request that does not include the Hop-Limit
option.[¶](#section-3-6){.pilcrow}

The initial Hop-Limit value should be configurable. If no initial value
is explicitly provided, the default initial Hop-Limit value of 16
[MUST]{.bcp14} be used. This value is chosen so that in the majority of
cases, it is sufficiently large to guarantee that a CoAP request would
not be dropped in networks when there were no loops, but not so large as
to consume CoAP proxy resources when a loop does occur. The value is
still configurable to accommodate unusual topologies. Lower values
should be used with caution and only in networks where topologies are
known by the CoAP client (or proxy) inserting the Hop-Limit
option.[¶](#section-3-7){.pilcrow}

Because forwarding errors may occur if inadequate Hop-Limit values are
used, proxies at the boundaries of an administrative domain
[MAY]{.bcp14} be instructed to remove or rewrite the value of Hop-Limit
carried in received requests (i.e., ignore the value of Hop-Limit
received in a request). This modification should be done with caution in
case proxy-forwarded traffic repeatedly crosses the administrative
domain boundary in a loop, rendering ineffective the efficacy of loop
detection through the Hop-Limit option.[¶](#section-3-8){.pilcrow}

Otherwise, a CoAP proxy that understands the Hop-Limit option
[MUST]{.bcp14} decrement the value of the option by 1 prior to
forwarding it. A CoAP proxy that understands the Hop-Limit option [MUST
NOT]{.bcp14} use a stored 5.08 (Hop Limit Reached) error response unless
the value of the Hop-Limit option in the presented request is smaller
than or equal to the value of the Hop-Limit option in the request used
to obtain the stored response. Otherwise, the CoAP proxy follows the
behavior in [Section
5.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7252#section-5.6){.relref} of
\[[RFC7252](#RFC7252){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3-9){.pilcrow}

-   [Note: If a request with a given value of Hop-Limit failed to reach
    a server because the hop limit is exhausted, then the same failure
    will be observed if a smaller value of the Hop-Limit option is used
    instead.[¶](#section-3-10.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-10.1}

CoAP requests [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be forwarded if the Hop-Limit option is
set to \'0\' after decrement. Requests that cannot be forwarded because
of exhausted Hop-Limit [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be logged with a 5.08 (Hop Limit
Reached) error response sent back to the CoAP peer. It is
[RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14} that CoAP implementations support means to alert
administrators about loop errors so that appropriate actions are
undertaken.[¶](#section-3-11){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-4 .section}
## [4.](#section-4){.section-number .selfRef} [Debugging and Troubleshooting](#name-debugging-and-troubleshooti){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-debugging-and-troubleshooti}

To ease debugging and troubleshooting, the CoAP proxy that detects a
loop includes an identifier for itself in the diagnostic payload under
the conditions detailed in [Section
5.5.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7252#section-5.5.2){.relref} of
\[[RFC7252](#RFC7252){.xref}\]. That identifier [MUST NOT]{.bcp14}
include any space character (ASCII value 32). The identifier inserted by
a CoAP proxy can be, for example, a proxy name (e.g., p11.example.net),
proxy alias (e.g., myproxyalias), or IP address (e.g.,
2001:db8::1).[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

Each intermediate proxy involved in relaying a 5.08 (Hop Limit Reached)
error message prepends its own identifier in the diagnostic payload with
a space character used as separator. Only one identifier per proxy
should appear in the diagnostic payload. This approach allows the
limiting of the size of the 5.08 (Hop Limit Reached) error message,
eases the correlation with hops count, and detects whether a proxy was
involved in the forwarding of the 5.08 (Hop Limit Reached) error
message. Note that an intermediate proxy prepends its identifier only if
there is enough space as determined by the Path MTU ([Section
4.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7252#section-4.6){.relref} of
\[[RFC7252](#RFC7252){.xref}\]). If not, an intermediate proxy forwards
the 5.08 (Hop Limit Reached) error message to the next hop without
updating the diagnostic payload.[¶](#section-4-2){.pilcrow}

An intermediate proxy [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} forward a 5.08 (Hop Limit
Reached) error message if it detects that its identifier is included in
the diagnostic payload. Such messages [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be logged and
appropriate alerts sent to the
administrators.[¶](#section-4-3){.pilcrow}

## [5.](#section-5){.section-number .selfRef} [HTTP Mapping Considerations](#name-http-mapping-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-http-mapping-considerations}

This section focuses on the HTTP mappings specific to the CoAP extension
specified in this document. As a reminder, the basic normative
requirements on HTTP/CoAP mappings are defined in [Section
10](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7252#section-10){.relref} of
\[[RFC7252](#RFC7252){.xref}\]. The implementation guidelines for
HTTP/CoAP mappings are elaborated in
\[[RFC8075](#RFC8075){.xref}\].[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

By default, the HTTP-to-CoAP Proxy inserts a Hop-Limit option following
the guidelines in [Section 3](#spec){.xref}. The HTTP-to-CoAP Proxy may
be instructed by policy to insert a Hop-Limit option only if a Via
([Section
5.7.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7230#section-5.7.1){.relref} of
\[[RFC7230](#RFC7230){.xref}\]) or CDN-Loop header field
\[[RFC8586](#RFC8586){.xref}\] is present in the HTTP
request.[¶](#section-5-2){.pilcrow}

The HTTP-to-CoAP Proxy uses 508 (Loop Detected) as the HTTP response
status code to map 5.08 (Hop Limit Reached). Furthermore, it maps the
diagnostic payload of 5.08 (Hop Limit Reached) as per [Section
6.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8075#section-6.6){.relref} of
\[[RFC8075](#RFC8075){.xref}\].[¶](#section-5-3){.pilcrow}

By default, the CoAP-to-HTTP Proxy inserts a Via header field in the
HTTP request if the CoAP request includes a Hop-Limit option. The
CoAP-to-HTTP Proxy may be instructed by policy to insert a CDN-Loop
header field instead of the Via header field.[¶](#section-5-4){.pilcrow}

The CoAP-to-HTTP Proxy maps the 508 (Loop Detected) HTTP response status
code to 5.08 (Hop Limit Reached). Moreover, the CoAP-to-HTTP Proxy
inserts its information following the guidelines in [Section
4](#debug){.xref}.[¶](#section-5-5){.pilcrow}

When both HTTP-to-CoAP and CoAP-to-HTTP proxies are involved, the loop
detection may break if the proxy-forwarded traffic repeatedly crosses
the HTTP-to-CoAP and CoAP-to-HTTP proxies. Nevertheless, if the loop is
within the CoAP or HTTP legs, the loop detection is still
functional.[¶](#section-5-6){.pilcrow}

Security considerations related to CoAP proxying are discussed in
[Section
11.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7252#section-11.2){.relref} of
\[[RFC7252](#RFC7252){.xref}\].[¶](#section-7-1){.pilcrow}

A CoAP endpoint can probe the topology of a network into which it is
making requests by tweaking the value of the Hop-Limit option. Such
probing is likely to fail if proxies at the boundaries of that network
rewrite the value of Hop-Limit carried in received requests (see
[Section 3](#spec){.xref}).[¶](#section-7-2){.pilcrow}

The diagnostic payload of a 5.08 (Hop Limit Reached) error message may
leak sensitive information revealing the topology of an administrative
domain. To prevent that, a CoAP proxy that is located at the boundary of
an administrative domain [MAY]{.bcp14} be instructed to strip the
diagnostic payload or part of it before forwarding on the 5.08 (Hop
Limit Reached) response.[¶](#section-7-3){.pilcrow}
