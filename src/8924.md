Service Function Chaining (SFC) enables the creation of composite
services that consist of an ordered set of Service Functions (SFs) that
are to be applied to any traffic selected as a result of classification
\[[RFC7665](#RFC7665){.xref}\]. SFC is a concept that provides for more
than just the application of an ordered set of SFs to selected traffic;
rather, it describes a method for deploying SFs in a way that enables
dynamic ordering and topological independence of those SFs as well as
the exchange of metadata between participating entities. The foundations
of SFC are described in the following
documents:[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

target.[¶](#section-1-6){.pilcrow}

OAM controllers are SFC-aware network devices that are capable of
generating OAM packets. They should be within the same administrative

Multiple layers come into play for implementing the SFC. These include
the service layer and the underlying layers (network layer, link layer,
etc.).[¶](#section-2-1){.pilcrow}

-   [The service layer consists of SFC data-plane elements that include
    classifiers, Service Functions (SFs), Service Function Forwarders
    (SFF), and SFC Proxies. This layer uses the overlay network layer
    for ensuring connectivity between SFC data-plane
    elements.[¶](#section-2-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-2-2.1}
-   [The overlay network layer leverages various overlay network
    technologies (e.g., Virtual eXtensible Local Area Network (VXLAN))
    for interconnecting SFC data-plane elements and allows establishing
    Service Function Paths (SFPs). This layer is mostly transparent to
    the SFC data-plane elements, as not all the data-plane elements
    process the overlay
    header.[¶](#section-2-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-2-2.2}
-   [The underlay network layer is dictated by the networking technology
    deployed within a network (e.g., IP,
    MPLS).[¶](#section-2-2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-2-2.3}
-   [The link layer is tightly coupled with the physical technology
    used. Ethernet is one such choice for this layer, but other
    alternatives may be deployed (e.g., POS and DWDM). In a virtual
    environment, virtualized I/O technologies, such as Single Root I/O
    Virtualization (SR-IOV) or similar, are also applicable for this
    layer. The same or distinct link layer technologies may be used in
    each leg shown in [Figure
    1](#SFC-example){.xref}.[¶](#section-2-2.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-2-2.4}

In [Figure 1](#SFC-example){.xref}, the service-layer elements, such as
classifier and SF, are depicted as virtual entities that are
interconnected using an overlay network. The underlay network may
comprise multiple intermediate nodes not shown in the figure that
provide underlay connectivity between the service-layer
elements.[¶](#section-2-5){.pilcrow}

While [Figure 1](#SFC-example){.xref} depicts an example where SFs are
enabled as virtual entities, the SFC architecture does not make any
assumptions on how the SFC data-plane elements are deployed. The SFC
architecture is flexible and accommodates physical or virtual entity
deployment. SFC OAM accounts for this flexibility, and accordingly it is
applicable whether SFC data-plane elements are deployed directly on
physical hardware, as one or more virtual entities, or any combination
thereof.[¶](#section-2-6){.pilcrow}

The SFC operates at the service layer. For the purpose of defining the
OAM framework, the service layer is broken up into three distinct
components:[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

SF component:
:   OAM functions applicable at this component include testing the SFs
    from any SFC-aware network device (e.g., classifiers, controllers,
    and other service nodes). Testing an SF may be more expansive than
    just checking connectivity to the SF, such as checking if the SF is
    providing its intended service. Refer to [Section
    3.1.1](#SF-avail){.xref} for a more detailed
    discussion.[¶](#section-3-2.2){.pilcrow}
:   

SFC component:
:   OAM functions applicable at this component include (but are not
    limited to) testing the SFCs and the SFPs, validation of the
    correlation between an SFC and the actual forwarding path followed
    by a packet matching that SFC, i.e., the Rendered Service Path
    (RSP). Some of the hops of an SFC may not be visible when
    Hierarchical Service Function Chaining (hSFC)
    \[[RFC8459](#RFC8459){.xref}\] is in use. In such schemes, it is the
    responsibility of the Internal Boundary Node (IBN) to glue the
    connectivity between different levels for end-to-end OAM
    functionality.[¶](#section-3-2.4){.pilcrow}
:   

Classifier component:
:   OAM functions applicable at this component include testing the
    validity of the classification rules and detecting any incoherence
    among the rules installed when more than one classifier is used, as
    explained in [Section
    2.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7665#section-2.2){.relref} of

:::

It is expected that multiple SFC OAM solutions will be defined, each
targeting one specific component of the service layer. However, it is
critical that SFC OAM solutions together provide the coverage of all
three SFC OAM components: the SF component, the SFC component, and the
classifier component.[¶](#section-3-6){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-3.1 .section}

#### [3.1.1.](#section-3.1.1){.section-number .selfRef} [SF Availability](#name-sf-availability){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-sf-availability}

One SFC OAM requirement for the SF component is to allow an SFC-aware
network device to check the availability of a specific SF (instance),
located on the same or different network device(s). For cases where
multiple instances of an SF are used to realize a given SF for the
purpose of load sharing, SF availability can be performed by checking
the availability of any one of those instances, or the availability
check may be targeted at a specific instance. SF availability is an
aspect that raises an interesting question: How does one determine that
an SF is available? At one end of the spectrum, one might argue that an
SF is sufficiently available if the service node (physical or virtual)
hosting the SF is available and is functional. At the other end of the
spectrum, one might argue that the SF\'s availability can only be
deduced if the packet, after passing through the SF, was examined and it
was verified that the packet did indeed get the expected
service.[¶](#section-3.1.1-1){.pilcrow}

The former approach will likely not provide sufficient confidence about
the actual SF availability, i.e., a service node and an SF are two
different entities. The latter approach is capable of providing an
extensive verification but comes at a cost. Some SFs make direct
modifications to packets, while others do not. Additionally, the purpose
of some SFs may be to drop certain packets intentionally. In such cases,
it is normal behavior that certain packets will not be egressing out
from the SF. The OAM mechanism needs to take into account such SF
specifics when assessing SF availability. Note that there are many
flavors of SFs available and many more that are likely be introduced in
the future. Even a given SF may introduce a new functionality (e.g., a
new signature in a firewall). The cost of this approach is that the OAM
mechanism for some SF will need to be continuously modified in order to
\"keep up\" with new functionality being
introduced.[¶](#section-3.1.1-2){.pilcrow}

The SF availability check can be performed using a generalized approach,
i.e., at an adequate granularity to provide a basic SF service. The task
of evaluating the true availability of an SF is a complex activity,
currently having no simple, unified solution. There is currently no
standard means of doing so. Any such mechanism would be far from a
typical OAM function, so it is not explored as part of the analysis in
Sections [4](#_SFC_OAM_Func){.xref} and

#### [3.1.2.](#section-3.1.2){.section-number .selfRef} [SF Performance Measurement](#name-sf-performance-measurement){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-sf-performance-measurement}

The second SFC OAM requirement for the SF component is to allow an
SFC-aware network device to check the performance metrics, such as loss
and delay induced by a specific SF for processing legitimate traffic.
Performance measurement can be passive by using live traffic, an active
measurement by using synthetic probe packets, or a hybrid method that
uses a combination of active and passive measurement. More details about
this OAM function is explained in [Section
4.4](#Perform_Funct){.xref}.[¶](#section-3.1.2-1){.pilcrow}

On the one hand, the performance of any specific SF can be quantified by
measuring the loss and delay metrics of the traffic from the SFF to the
respective SF, while on the other hand, the performance can be measured
by leveraging the loss and delay metrics from the respective SFs. The
latter requires SF involvement to perform the measurement, while the
former does not. For cases where multiple instances of an SF are used to
realize a given SF for the purpose of load sharing, SF performance can
be quantified by measuring the metrics for any one instance of SF or by
measuring the metrics for a specific
instance.[¶](#section-3.1.2-2){.pilcrow}

The metrics measured to quantify the performance of the SF component are
not just limited to loss and delay. Other metrics, such as throughput,
also exist and the choice of metrics for performance measurement is
outside the scope of this document.[¶](#section-3.1.2-3){.pilcrow}

An SFC could comprise varying SFs, and so the OAM layer is required to
perform validation and verification of SFs within an SFP, in addition to
connectivity verification and fault
isolation.[¶](#section-3.2.1-1){.pilcrow}

In order to perform service connectivity verification of an SFC/SFP, the
OAM functions could be initiated from any SFC-aware network device of an
SFC-enabled domain for end-to-end paths, or partial paths terminating on
a specific SF, within the SFC/SFP. The goal of this OAM function is to
ensure the SFs chained together have connectivity, as was intended at
the time when the SFC was established. The necessary return codes should
be defined for sending back in the response to the OAM packet, in order
to complete the verification.[¶](#section-3.2.1-2){.pilcrow}

When ECMP is in use at the service layer for any given SFC, there must
be the ability to discover and traverse all available
paths.[¶](#section-3.2.1-3){.pilcrow}

A classifier maintains the classification rules that map a flow to a
specific SFC. It is vital that the classifier is correctly configured
with updated classification rules and is functioning as expected. The
SFC OAM must be able to validate the classification rules by assessing
whether a flow is appropriately mapped to the relevant SFC and detect
any misclassification. Sample OAM packets can be presented to the
classifiers to assess the behavior with regard to a given classification
entry.[¶](#section-3.3-1){.pilcrow}

The classifier availability check may be performed to check the
availability of the classifier to apply the rules and classify the
traffic flows. Any SFC-aware network device should have the ability to
perform availability checking of the classifier component for each
SFC.[¶](#section-3.3-2){.pilcrow}

Any SFC-aware network device should have the ability to perform

Continuity is a model where OAM messages are sent periodically to

the entire SFC. This allows a monitoring network device (such as the
classifier or controller) to quickly detect failures, such as link
failures, network element failures, SF outages, or SFC outages. BFD

Performance measurement functions involve measuring of packet loss,
delay, delay variance, etc. These performance metrics may be measured
proactively or on demand.[¶](#section-4.4-1){.pilcrow}

SFC OAM should provide the ability to measure packet loss for an SFC.
On-demand measurement can be used to estimate packet loss using
statistical methods. To ensure accurate estimations, one needs to ensure
that OAM packets are treated the same and also share the same fate as
regular data traffic.[¶](#section-4.4-2){.pilcrow}

Delay within an SFC could be measured based on the time it takes for a
packet to traverse the SFC from the ingress SFC node to the egress SFF.
Measurement protocols, such as the One-Way Active Measurement Protocol
(OWAMP) \[[RFC4656](#RFC4656){.xref}\] and the Two-Way Active
Measurement Protocol (TWAMP) \[[RFC5357](#RFC5357){.xref}\], can be used
to measure delay characteristics. As SFCs are unidirectional in nature,
measurement of one-way delay \[[RFC7679](#RFC7679){.xref}\] is
important. In order to measure one-way delay, time synchronization must
be supported by means such as NTP, GPS, Precision Time Protocol (PTP),
etc.[¶](#section-4.4-3){.pilcrow}

One-way delay variation \[[RFC3393](#RFC3393){.xref}\] could also be
calculated by sending OAM packets and measuring the jitter for traffic
passing through an SFC.[¶](#section-4.4-4){.pilcrow}

check for Ethernet links. There is an effort around NVO3 OAM to provide
connectivity and continuity checks for networks that use NVO3. BFD is

## [6.](#section-6){.section-number .selfRef} [Operational Aspects of SFC OAM at the Service Layer](#name-operational-aspects-of-sfc-){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-operational-aspects-of-sfc-}

This section describes the operational aspects of SFC OAM at the service
layer to perform the SFC OAM function defined in [Section
4](#_SFC_OAM_Func){.xref} and analyzes the applicability of various
existing OAM toolsets in the service layer.[¶](#section-6-1){.pilcrow}

### [6.1.](#section-6.1){.section-number .selfRef} [SFC OAM Packet Marker](#name-sfc-oam-packet-marker){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-sfc-oam-packet-marker}

SFC OAM messages should be encapsulated with the necessary SFC header
and with OAM markings when testing the SFC component. SFC OAM messages
may be encapsulated with the necessary SFC header and with OAM markings
when testing the SF component.[¶](#section-6.1-1){.pilcrow}

The SFC OAM function described in [Section 4](#_SFC_OAM_Func){.xref}
performed at the service layer or overlay network layer must mark the
packet as an OAM packet so that relevant nodes can differentiate OAM
packets from data packets. The base header defined in [Section
2.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8300#section-2.2){.relref} of
\[[RFC8300](#RFC8300){.xref}\] assigns a bit to indicate OAM packets.
When NSH encapsulation is used at the service layer, the O bit must be
set to differentiate the OAM packet. Any other overlay encapsulations
used at the service layer must have a way to mark the packet as an OAM
packet.[¶](#section-6.1-2){.pilcrow}

Upon receiving an OAM packet, an SFC-aware SF may choose to discard the
packet if it does not support OAM functionality or if the local policy
prevents it from processing the OAM packet. When an SF supports OAM
functionality, it is desirable to process the packet and provide an
appropriate response to allow end-to-end verification. To limit
performance impact due to OAM, SFC-aware SFs should rate-limit the
number of OAM packets processed.[¶](#section-6.2-1){.pilcrow}

An SFF may choose to not forward the OAM packet to an SF if the SF does
not support OAM or if the policy does not allow the forwarding of OAM
packets to that SF. The SFF may choose to skip the SF, modify the
packet\'s header, and forward the packet to the next SFC node in the
chain. It should be noted that skipping an SF might have implications on
some OAM functions (e.g., the delay measurement may not be accurate).
The method by which an SFF detects if the connected SF supports or is
allowed to process OAM packets is outside the scope of this document. It
could be a configuration parameter instructed by the controller, or it
can be done by dynamic negotiation between the SF and
SFF.[¶](#section-6.2-2){.pilcrow}

If the SFF receiving the OAM packet bound to a given SFC is the last SFF
in the chain, it must send a relevant response to the initiator of the
OAM packet. Depending on the type of OAM solution and toolset used, the
response could be a simple response (such as ICMP reply) or could
include additional data from the received OAM packet (like statistical
data consolidated along the path). The details are expected to be
covered in the solution documents.[¶](#section-6.2-3){.pilcrow}

Any SFC-aware node that initiates an OAM packet must set the OAM marker
in the overlay encapsulation.[¶](#section-6.2-4){.pilcrow}

As described in [Section 4](#_SFC_OAM_Func){.xref}, there are different
OAM functions that may require different OAM solutions. While the
presence of the OAM marker in the overlay header (e.g., O bit in the NSH
header) indicates it as an OAM packet, it is not sufficient to indicate
what OAM function the packet is intended for. The Next Protocol field in
the NSH header may be used to indicate what OAM function is intended or
what toolset is used. Any other overlay encapsulations used at the
service layer must have a similar way to indicate the intended OAM
function.[¶](#section-6.3-1){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC0792](#RFC0792){.xref}\] and \[[RFC4443](#RFC4443){.xref}\]
describe the use of ICMP in IPv4 and IPv6 networks respectively. It
explains how ICMP messages can be used to test the network reachability
between different end points and perform basic network
diagnostics.[¶](#section-7.1-1){.pilcrow}

ICMP could be leveraged for connectivity functions (defined in [Section
4.1](#Connect_Func){.xref}) to verify the availability of an SF or SFC.
The initiator can generate an ICMP echo request message and control the
service-layer encapsulation header to get the response from the relevant
node. For example, a classifier initiating OAM can generate an ICMP echo
request message, set the TTL field in the NSH header
\[[RFC8300](#RFC8300){.xref}\] to 63 to get the response from the last
SFF, and thereby test the SFC availability. Alternatively, the initiator
can set the TTL to some other value to get the response from a specific
SF and thereby partially test SFC availability, or the initiator could
send OAM packets with sequentially incrementing TTL in the NSH to trace
the SFP.[¶](#section-7.1-2){.pilcrow}

It could be observed that ICMP as currently defined may not be able to
perform all required SFC OAM functions, but as explained above, it can
be used for some of the connectivity
functions.[¶](#section-7.1-3){.pilcrow}

networks.[¶](#section-7.2-1){.pilcrow}

BFD or S-BFD could be leveraged to perform the continuity function for
SF or SFC. An initiator could generate a BFD control packet and set the
\"Your Discriminator\" value in the control packet to identify the last
SFF. Upon receiving the control packet, the last SFF in the SFC will
reply back with the relevant DIAG code. The TTL field in the NSH header
could be used to perform a partial SFC availability check. For example,
the initiator can set the \"Your Discriminator\" value to identify the
SF that is intended to be tested and set the TTL field in the NSH header
in a way that it expires at the relevant SF. How the initiator gets the
Discriminator value to identify the SF is outside the scope of this

While the NETCONF capabilities are readily available, as depicted in

Any security considerations defined in \[[RFC7665](#RFC7665){.xref}\]
and \[[RFC8300](#RFC8300){.xref}\] are applicable for this
document.[¶](#section-9-1){.pilcrow}

The OAM information from the service layer at different components may
collectively or independently reveal sensitive information. The
information may reveal the type of service functions hosted in the
network, the classification rules and the associated service chains,
specific service function paths, etc. The sensitivity of the information
from the SFC layer raises a need for careful security
considerations.[¶](#section-9-2){.pilcrow}

The mapping and the rules information at the classifier component may
reveal the traffic rules and the traffic mapped to the SFC. The SFC
information collected at an SFC component may reveal the SFs associated
within each chain, and this information together with classifier rules
may be used to manipulate the header of synthetic attack packets that
may be used to bypass the SFC and trigger any internal
attacks.[¶](#section-9-3){.pilcrow}

The SF information at the SF component may be used by a malicious user
to trigger a Denial of Service (DoS) attack by overloading any specific
SF using rogue OAM traffic.[¶](#section-9-4){.pilcrow}

To address the above concerns, SFC and SF OAM should provide mechanisms
for mitigating:[¶](#section-9-5){.pilcrow}

-   [misuse of the OAM channel for denial of
    services,[¶](#section-9-6.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-9-6.1}
-   [leakage of OAM packets across SFC instances,
    and[¶](#section-9-6.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-9-6.2}
-   [leakage of SFC information beyond the SFC
    domain.[¶](#section-9-6.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-9-6.3}

The documents proposing the OAM solution for SF components should
provide rate-limiting the OAM probes at a frequency guided by the
implementation choice. Rate-limiting may be applied at the classifier,
SFF, or the SF. The OAM initiator may not receive a response for the
probes that are rate-limited resulting in false negatives, and the
implementation should be aware of this. To mitigate any attacks that
leverage OAM packets, future documents proposing OAM solutions should
describe the use of any technique to detect and mitigate anomalies and
various security attacks.[¶](#section-9-7){.pilcrow}

The documents proposing the OAM solution for any service-layer
components should consider some form of message filtering to control the
OAM packets entering the administrative domain or prevent leaking any
internal service-layer information outside the administrative
domain.[¶](#section-9-8){.pilcrow}
