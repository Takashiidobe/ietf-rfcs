# RFC 8978 {#rfcnum}

# Reaction of IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) to Flash-Renumbering Events {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

In scenarios where network configuration information related to IPv6
prefixes becomes invalid without any explicit and reliable signaling of
that condition (such as when a Customer Edge router crashes and reboots
without knowledge of the previously employed prefixes), hosts on the
local network may continue using stale prefixes for an unacceptably long
time (on the order of several days), thus resulting in connectivity
problems. This document describes this issue and discusses operational
workarounds that may help to improve network robustness. Additionally,
it highlights areas where further work may be
needed.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC)
\[[RFC4862](#RFC4862){.xref}\] conveys information about prefixes to be
employed for address configuration via Prefix Information Options (PIOs)
sent in Router Advertisement (RA) messages. IPv6 largely assumes prefix
stability, with network renumbering only taking place in a planned
manner: old prefixes are deprecated (and eventually invalidated) via
reduced prefix lifetimes and new prefixes are introduced (with longer
lifetimes) at the same time. However, there are several scenarios that
may lead to the so-called \"flash-renumbering\" events, where a prefix
employed by a network suddenly becomes invalid and replaced by a new
prefix. In some of these scenarios, the local router producing the
network renumbering event may try to deprecate (and eventually
invalidate) the currently employed prefix (by explicitly signaling the
network about the renumbering event), whereas in other scenarios, it may
be unable to do so.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

In scenarios where network configuration information related to IPv6
prefixes becomes invalid without any explicit and reliable signaling of
that condition, hosts on the local network may continue using stale
prefixes for an unacceptably long period of time, thus resulting in
connectivity problems.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

Scenarios where this problem may arise include, but are not limited to,
the following:[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

-   [The most common IPv6 deployment scenario for residential or small
    office networks, where a Customer Edge (CE) router employs DHCPv6
    Prefix Delegation (DHCPv6-PD) \[[RFC8415](#RFC8415){.xref}\] to
    request a prefix from an Internet Service Provider (ISP), and a
    sub-prefix of the leased prefix is advertised on the LAN side of the
    CE router via Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC)
    \[[RFC4862](#RFC4862){.xref}\]. In scenarios where the CE router
    crashes and reboots, the CE router may obtain (via DHCPv6-PD) a
    different prefix from the one previously leased and therefore
    advertise (via SLAAC) a new sub-prefix on the LAN side. Hosts will
    typically configure addresses for the new sub-prefix but will also
    normally retain and may actively employ the addresses configured for
    the previously advertised sub-prefix, since their associated
    Preferred Lifetime and Valid Lifetime allow them to do
    so.[¶](#section-1-4.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-4.1}
-   [A router (e.g., Customer Edge router) advertises autoconfiguration
    prefixes (corresponding to prefixes learned via DHCPv6-PD) with
    constant PIO lifetimes that are not synchronized with the DHCPv6-PD
    lease time (even though [Section
    6.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8415#section-6.3){.relref} of
    \[[RFC8415](#RFC8415){.xref}\] requires such synchronization). While
    this behavior violates the aforementioned requirement from
    \[[RFC8415](#RFC8415){.xref}\], it is not an unusual behavior. For
    example, this is particularly true for implementations in which
    DHCPv6-PD is implemented in a different software module than
    SLAAC.[¶](#section-1-4.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-4.2}
-   [A switch-port that a host is connected to is moved to another
    subnet (VLAN) as a result of manual switch-port reconfiguration or
    802.1x reauthentication. There has been evidence that some 802.1x
    supplicants do not reset network settings after successful 802.1x
    authentication. If a host fails 802.1x authentication for some
    reason, it may be placed in a \"quarantine\" VLAN; if successfully
    authenticated later on, the host may end up having IPv6 addresses
    from both the old (\"quarantine\") and new
    VLANs.[¶](#section-1-4.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-4.3}
-   [During a planned network renumbering event, a router is configured
    to send an RA including a Prefix Information Option (PIO) for the
    \"old\" prefix with the Preferred Lifetime set to zero and the Valid
    Lifetime set to a small value, as well as a PIO for the new prefix
    with default lifetimes. However, due to unsolicited RAs being sent
    to a multicast destination address, and multicast being rather
    unreliable on busy Wi-Fi networks, the RA might not be received by
    local hosts.[¶](#section-1-4.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-4.4}
-   [An automated device config management system performs periodic
    config pushes to network devices. In these scenarios, network
    devices may simply immediately forget their previous configuration,
    rather than withdraw it gracefully. If such a push results in
    changing the prefix configured on a particular subnet, hosts
    attached to that subnet might not get notified about the prefix
    change, and their addresses from the \"old\" prefix might not be
    deprecated (and eventually invalidated) in a timely manner. A
    related scenario is an incorrect network renumbering event, where a
    network administrator renumbers a network by simply removing the
    \"old\" prefix from the configuration and configuring a new prefix
    instead.[¶](#section-1-4.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-4.5}

Lacking any explicit and reliable signaling to deprecate (and eventually
invalidate) the stale prefixes, hosts may continue to employ the
previously configured addresses, which will typically result in packets
being filtered or blackholed either on the CE router or within the ISP
network.[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}

The default values for the Preferred Lifetime and Valid Lifetime of PIOs
specified in \[[RFC4861](#RFC4861){.xref}\] mean that, in the
aforementioned scenarios, the stale addresses would be retained and
could be actively employed for new communication instances for an
unacceptably long period of time (one month and one week, respectively).
This could lead to interoperability problems, instead of hosts
transitioning to the newly advertised prefix(es) in a more timely
manner.[¶](#section-1-6){.pilcrow}

Some devices have implemented ad hoc mechanisms to address this problem,
such as sending RAs to deprecate (and eventually invalidate) apparently
stale prefixes when the device receives any packets employing a source
address from a prefix not currently advertised for address configuration
on the local network \[[FRITZ](#FRITZ){.xref}\]. However, this may
introduce other interoperability problems, particularly in
multihomed/multi-prefix scenarios. This is a clear indication that
advice in this area is warranted.[¶](#section-1-7){.pilcrow}

Unresponsiveness to these flash-renumbering events is caused by the
inability of the network to deprecate (and eventually invalidate) stale
information as well as by the inability of hosts to react to network
configuration changes in a more timely manner. Clearly, it would be
desirable that these flash-renumbering events do not occur and that,
when they do occur, hosts are explicitly and reliably notified of their
occurrence. However, for robustness reasons, it is paramount for hosts
to be able to recover from stale configuration information even when
these flash-renumbering events occur and the network is unable to
explicitly and reliably notify hosts about such
conditions.[¶](#section-1-8){.pilcrow}

[Section 2](#problem){.xref} analyzes this problem in more detail.
[Section 3](#Solutions){.xref} describes possible operational
mitigations. [Section 4](#futurework){.xref} describes possible future
work to mitigate the aforementioned problem.[¶](#section-1-9){.pilcrow}

As noted in [Section 1](#intro){.xref}, the problem discussed in this
document is exacerbated by the default values of some protocol
parameters and other factors. The following sections analyze each of
them in detail.[¶](#section-2-1){.pilcrow}

### [2.1.](#section-2.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Use of Dynamic Prefixes](#name-use-of-dynamic-prefixes){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-use-of-dynamic-prefixes}

In network scenarios where dynamic prefixes are employed, renumbering
events lead to updated network configuration information being
propagated through the network, such that the renumbering events are
gracefully handled. However, if the renumbering event happens along
with, e.g., loss of configuration state by some of the devices involved
in the renumbering procedure (e.g., a router crashes, reboots, and gets
leased a new prefix), this may result in a flash-renumbering event,
where new prefixes are introduced without properly phasing out the old
ones.[¶](#section-2.1-1){.pilcrow}

In simple residential or small office scenarios, the problem discussed
in this document would be avoided if DHCPv6-PD leased \"stable\"
prefixes. However, a recent survey \[[UK-NOF](#UK-NOF){.xref}\]
indicates that 37% of the responding ISPs employ dynamic IPv6 prefixes.
That is, dynamic IPv6 prefixes are an operational
reality.[¶](#section-2.1-2){.pilcrow}

Deployment reality aside, there are a number of possible issues
associated with stable prefixes:[¶](#section-2.1-3){.pilcrow}

-   [Provisioning systems may be unable to deliver stable IPv6
    prefixes.[¶](#section-2.1-4.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.1-4.1}
-   [While an ISP might lease stable prefixes to the home or small
    office, the Customer Edge router might in turn lease sub-prefixes of
    these prefixes to other internal network devices. Unless the
    associated lease databases are stored on non-volatile memory, these
    internal devices might get leased dynamic sub-prefixes of the stable
    prefix leased by the ISP. In other words, every time a prefix is
    leased, there is the potential for the resulting prefixes to become
    dynamic, even if the device leasing sub-prefixes has been leased a
    stable prefix by its upstream
    router.[¶](#section-2.1-4.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.1-4.2}
-   [While there is a range of information that may be employed to
    correlate network activity \[[RFC7721](#RFC7721){.xref}\], the use
    of stable prefixes clearly simplifies network activity correlation
    and may reduce the effectiveness of \"temporary addresses\"
    \[[RFC8981](#RFC8981){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2.1-4.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.1-4.3}
-   [There might be existing advice for ISPs to deliver dynamic IPv6
    prefixes **by default** (e.g., see
    \[[GERMAN-DP](#GERMAN-DP){.xref}\]) over privacy concerns associated
    with stable
    prefixes.[¶](#section-2.1-4.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.1-4.4}
-   [There might be scalability and performance drawbacks of either a
    disaggregated distributed routing topology or a centralized
    topology, which are often required to provide stable prefixes, i.e.,
    distributing more-specific routes or summarizing routes at
    centralized
    locations.[¶](#section-2.1-4.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.1-4.5}

For a number of reasons (such as the ones stated above), IPv6
deployments might employ dynamic prefixes (even at the expense of the
issues discussed in this document), and there might be scenarios in
which the dynamics of a network are such that the network exhibits the
behavior of dynamic prefixes. Rather than trying to regulate how
operators may run their networks, this document aims at improving
network robustness in the deployed
Internet.[¶](#section-2.1-5){.pilcrow}

The impact of the issue discussed in this document is a function of the
lifetime values employed for PIOs, since these values determine for how
long the corresponding addresses will be preferred and considered valid.
Thus, when the problem discussed in this document is experienced, the
longer the PIO lifetimes, the higher the
impact.[¶](#section-2.2-1){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC4861](#RFC4861){.xref}\] specifies the following default PIO
lifetime values:[¶](#section-2.2-2){.pilcrow}

-   [Preferred Lifetime (AdvPreferredLifetime): 604800 seconds (7
    days)[¶](#section-2.2-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.2-3.1}
-   [Valid Lifetime (AdvValidLifetime): 2592000 seconds (30
    days)[¶](#section-2.2-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.2-3.2}

Under problematic circumstances, such as when the corresponding network
information has become stale without any explicit and reliable signal
from the network (as described in [Section 1](#intro){.xref}), it could
take hosts up to 7 days (one week) to deprecate the corresponding
addresses and up to 30 days (one month) to eventually invalidate and
remove any addresses configured for the stale prefix. This means that it
will typically take hosts an unacceptably long period of time (on the
order of several days) to recover from these
scenarios.[¶](#section-2.2-4){.pilcrow}

SLAAC hosts are unable to recover from stale network configuration
information, since:[¶](#section-2.3-1){.pilcrow}

-   [In scenarios where SLAAC routers explicitly signal the renumbering
    event, hosts will typically deprecate, but not invalidate, the stale
    addresses, since item \"e)\" of [Section
    5.5.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4862#section-5.5.3){.relref}
    of \[[RFC4862](#RFC4862){.xref}\] specifies that an unauthenticated
    RA may never reduce the valid lifetime of an address to less than
    two hours. Communication with the new \"users\" of the stale prefix
    will not be possible, since the stale prefix will still be
    considered \"on-link\" by the local
    hosts.[¶](#section-2.3-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.3-2.1}
-   [In the absence of explicit signaling from SLAAC routers, SLAAC
    hosts will typically fail to recover from stale configuration
    information in a timely manner, since hosts would need to rely on
    the last Preferred Lifetime and Valid Lifetime advertised for the

    and subsequently invalidated. Please see [Section

### [2.4.](#section-2.4){.section-number .selfRef} [Lack of Explicit Signaling about Stale Information](#name-lack-of-explicit-signaling-){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-lack-of-explicit-signaling-}

Whenever prefix information has changed, a SLAAC router should advertise
not only the new information but also the stale information with
appropriate lifetime values (both the Preferred Lifetime and the Valid
Lifetime set to 0). This would provide explicit signaling to SLAAC hosts
to remove the stale information (including configured addresses and
routes). However, in certain scenarios, such as when a CE router crashes
and reboots, the CE router may have no knowledge about the previously
advertised prefixes and thus might be unable to advertise them with
appropriate lifetimes (in order to deprecate and eventually invalidate
them).[¶](#section-2.4-1){.pilcrow}

In any case, we note that, as discussed in [Section
2.3](#hosts-problem){.xref}, PIOs with small Valid Lifetimes in
unauthenticated RAs will not lower the Valid Lifetime to any value
shorter than two hours (as per \[[RFC4862](#RFC4862){.xref}\]).
Therefore, even if a SLAAC router tried to explicitly signal the network
about the stale configuration information via unauthenticated RAs,
implementations compliant with \[[RFC4862](#RFC4862){.xref}\] would
deprecate the corresponding prefixes but would fail to invalidate
them.[¶](#section-2.4-2){.pilcrow}

NOTE:[¶](#section-2.4-3.1){.pilcrow}

Some implementations have been updated to honor small PIO lifetimes
values, as proposed in
\[[RENUM-RXN](#I-D.ietf-6man-slaac-renum){.xref}\]. For example, please

### [2.5.](#section-2.5){.section-number .selfRef} [Interaction between DHCPv6-PD and SLAAC](#name-interaction-between-dhcpv6-){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-interaction-between-dhcpv6-}

While DHCPv6-PD is normally employed along with SLAAC, the interaction
between the two protocols is largely unspecified. Not unusually, the two
protocols are implemented in two different software components, with the
interface between the two implemented by means of some sort of script
that feeds the SLAAC implementation with values learned from
DHCPv6-PD.[¶](#section-2.5-1){.pilcrow}

At times, the prefix lease time is fed as a constant value to the SLAAC
router implementation, meaning that, eventually, the prefix lifetimes
advertised on the LAN side will span **past** the DHCPv6-PD lease time.
This is clearly incorrect, since the SLAAC router implementation would
be allowing the use of such prefixes for a period of time that is longer
than the one they have been leased for via
DHCPv6-PD.[¶](#section-2.5-2){.pilcrow}

### [3.2.](#section-3.2){.section-number .selfRef} [SLAAC Parameter Tweaking](#name-slaac-parameter-tweaking){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-slaac-parameter-tweaking}

An operator may wish to override some SLAAC parameters such that, under
normal circumstances, the associated timers will be refreshed/reset, but
in the presence of network faults (such as the one discussed in this
document), the associated timers go off and trigger some fault
recovering action (e.g., deprecate and eventually invalidate stale
addresses).[¶](#section-3.2-1){.pilcrow}

The following router configuration variables from
\[[RFC4861](#RFC4861){.xref}\] (corresponding to the \"lifetime\"
parameters of PIOs) could be overridden as
follows:[¶](#section-3.2-2){.pilcrow}

-   [AdvPreferredLifetime: 2700 seconds (45
    minutes)[¶](#section-3.2-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.2-3.1}
-   [AdvValidLifetime: 5400 seconds (90
    minutes)[¶](#section-3.2-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.2-3.2}

NOTES:[¶](#section-3.2-4.1){.pilcrow}

The aforementioned values for AdvPreferredLifetime and AdvValidLifetime
are expected to be appropriate for most networks. In some networks,
particularly those where the operator has complete control of prefix
allocation and where hosts on the network may spend long periods of time
sleeping (e.g., sensors with limited battery), longer values may be
appropriate.[¶](#section-3.2-4.2){.pilcrow}

A CE router advertising a sub-prefix of a prefix leased via DHCPv6-PD
will periodically refresh the Preferred Lifetime and the Valid Lifetime
of an advertised prefix to AdvPreferredLifetime and AdvValidLifetime,
respectively, as long as the resulting lifetimes of the corresponding
prefixes do not extend past the DHCPv6-PD lease time
\[[RENUM-CPE](#I-D.ietf-v6ops-cpe-slaac-renum){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3.2-4.3){.pilcrow}

RATIONALE:[¶](#section-3.2-5){.pilcrow}

-   [In the context of \[[RFC8028](#RFC8028){.xref}\], where it is clear
    that use of addresses configured for a given prefix is tied to using
    the next-hop router that advertised the prefix, it does not make
    sense for the Preferred Lifetime of a PIO to be larger than the
    Router Lifetime (AdvDefaultLifetime) of the corresponding Router
    Advertisement messages. The Valid Lifetime is set to a larger value
    to cope with transient network
    problems.[¶](#section-3.2-6.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.2-6.1}
-   [Lacking RAs that refresh information, addresses configured for
    advertised prefixes become deprecated in a more timely manner;
    therefore, Rule 3 of \[[RFC6724](#RFC6724){.xref}\] causes other
    configured addresses (if available) to be used
    instead.[¶](#section-3.2-6.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.2-6.2}
-   [Reducing the Valid Lifetime of PIOs helps reduce the amount of time
    a host may maintain stale information and the amount of time an
    advertising router would need to advertise stale prefixes to
    invalidate them. Reducing the Preferred Lifetime of PIOs helps
    reduce the amount of time it takes for a host to prefer other
    working prefixes (see [Section
    12](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4861#section-12){.relref} of
    \[[RFC4861](#RFC4861){.xref}\]). However, we note that while the
    values suggested in this section are an improvement over the default
    values specified in \[[RFC4861](#RFC4861){.xref}\], they represent a
    trade-off among a number of factors, including responsiveness,
    possible impact on the battery life of connected devices
    \[[RFC7772](#RFC7772){.xref}\], etc. Thus, they may or may not
    provide sufficient mitigation to the problem discussed in this
    document.[¶](#section-3.2-6.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.2-6.3}

## [4.](#section-4){.section-number .selfRef} [Future Work](#name-future-work){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-future-work}

Improvements in Customer Edge routers \[[RFC7084](#RFC7084){.xref}\],
such that they can signal hosts about stale prefixes to deprecate (and
eventually invalidate) them accordingly, can help mitigate the problem
discussed in this document for the \"home network\" scenario. Such work
is currently being pursued in
\[[RENUM-CPE](#I-D.ietf-v6ops-cpe-slaac-renum){.xref}\].[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

Improvements in the SLAAC protocol \[[RFC4862](#RFC4862){.xref}\] and
some IPv6-related algorithms, such as \"Default Address Selection for
Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6)\" \[[RFC6724](#RFC6724){.xref}\],
would help improve network robustness. Such work is currently being
pursued in
\[[RENUM-RXN](#I-D.ietf-6man-slaac-renum){.xref}\].[¶](#section-4-2){.pilcrow}

The aforementioned work is considered out of the scope of this present
document, which only focuses on documenting the problem and discussing
operational mitigations.[¶](#section-4-3){.pilcrow}
