# RFC 8994 {#rfcnum}

# An Autonomic Control Plane (ACP) {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

Autonomic functions need a control plane to communicate, which depends
on some addressing and routing. This Autonomic Control Plane should
ideally be self-managing and be as independent as possible of
configuration. This document defines such a plane and calls it the
\"Autonomic Control Plane\", with the primary use as a control plane for
autonomic functions. It also serves as a \"virtual out-of-band channel\"
for Operations, Administration, and Management (OAM) communications over
a network that provides automatically configured, hop-by-hop
authenticated and encrypted communications via automatically configured
IPv6 even when the network is not configured or is
misconfigured.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

Autonomic Networking is a concept of self-management: autonomic
functions self-configure, and negotiate parameters and settings across
the network. \"[Autonomic Networking: Definitions and Design
Goals](#RFC7575){.xref}\" \[[RFC7575](#RFC7575){.xref}\] defines the
fundamental ideas and design goals of Autonomic Networking. A gap
analysis of Autonomic Networking is given in \"[General Gap Analysis for
Autonomic Networking](#RFC7576){.xref}\" \[[RFC7576](#RFC7576){.xref}\].
The reference architecture for Autonomic Networking in the IETF is
specified in the document \"[A Reference Model for Autonomic
Networking](#RFC8993){.xref}\"
\[[RFC8993](#RFC8993){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

Autonomic functions need an autonomically built communications
infrastructure. This infrastructure needs to be secure, resilient, and
reusable by all autonomic functions. [Section
5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7575#section-5){.relref} of
\[[RFC7575](#RFC7575){.xref}\] introduces that infrastructure and calls
it the Autonomic Control Plane (ACP). More descriptively, it could be
called the \"Autonomic communications infrastructure for OAM and
control\". For naming consistency with that prior document, this
document continues to use the name ACP.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

Today, the OAM and control plane of IP networks is what is typically
called in-band management and/or signaling: its management and control
protocol traffic depends on the routing and forwarding tables, security,
policy, QoS, and potentially other configuration that first has to be
established through the very same management and control protocols.
Misconfigurations, including unexpected side effects or mutual
dependencies, can disrupt OAM and control operations and especially
disrupt remote management access to the affected node itself and
potentially disrupt access to a much larger number of nodes for which
the affected node is on the network path.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

For an example of in-band management failing in the face of
operator-induced misconfiguration, see \[[FCC](#FCC){.xref}\], for
example, Section III.B.15 on page 8:[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

> \...engineers almost immediately recognized that they had misdiagnosed
> the problem. However, they were unable to resolve the issue by
> restoring the link because the network management tools required to do
> so remotely relied on the same paths they had just
> disabled.[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}

Traditionally, physically separate, so-called out-of-band (management)
networks have been used to avoid these problems or at least to allow
recovery from such problems. In the worst-case scenario, personnel are
sent on site to access devices through out-of-band management ports
(also called craft ports, serial consoles, or management Ethernet
ports). However, both options are expensive.[¶](#section-1-6){.pilcrow}

In increasingly automated networks, both centralized management systems
and distributed autonomic service agents in the network require a
control plane that is independent of the configuration of the network
they manage, to avoid impacting their own operations through the
configuration actions they take.[¶](#section-1-7){.pilcrow}

This document describes a modular design for a self-forming,
self-managing, and self-protecting ACP, which is a virtual out-of-band
network designed to be as independent as possible of configuration,
addressing, and routing to avoid the self-dependency problems of current
IP networks while still operating in-band on the same physical network
that it is controlling and managing. The ACP design is therefore
intended to combine as well as possible the resilience of out-of-band
management networks with the low cost of traditional IP in-band network
management. The details of how this is achieved are described in
[Section 6](#self-creation){.xref}.[¶](#section-1-8){.pilcrow}

In a fully Autonomic Network without legacy control or management
functions and/or protocols, the data plane would be just a forwarding
plane for \"data\" IPv6 packets, which are packets other than those
control and management plane packets forwarded by the ACP itself. In
such a network, there would be no non-autonomous control of nodes nor a
non-autonomous management plane.[¶](#section-1-9){.pilcrow}

Routing protocols would be built inside the ACP as autonomous functions
via autonomous service agents, leveraging the following ACP functions
instead of implementing them separately for each protocol: discovery;
automatically established, authenticated, and encrypted local and
distant peer connectivity for control and management traffic; and common
session and presentation functions of the control and management
protocol.[¶](#section-1-10){.pilcrow}

When ACP functionality is added to nodes that do not have autonomous
management plane and/or control plane functions (henceforth called
non-autonomous nodes), the ACP instead is best abstracted as a special
Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF) instance (or virtual router), and
the complete, preexisting, non-autonomous management and/or control
plane is considered to be part of the data plane to avoid introducing
more complex terminology only for this case.[¶](#section-1-11){.pilcrow}

Like the forwarding plane for \"data\" packets, the non-autonomous
control and management plane functions can then be managed and/or used
via the ACP. This terminology is consistent with preexisting documents
such as \"[Using an Autonomic Control Plane for Stable Connectivity of
Network Operations, Administration, and Maintenance
(OAM)](#RFC8368){.xref}\"
\[[RFC8368](#RFC8368){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-12){.pilcrow}

In both autonomous and non-autonomous instances, the ACP is built such
that it operates in the absence of the data plane. The ACP also operates
in the presence of any (mis)configured non-autonomous management and/or
control components in the data plane.[¶](#section-1-13){.pilcrow}

The ACP serves several purposes
simultaneously:[¶](#section-1-14){.pilcrow}

1.  [Autonomic functions communicate over the ACP. The ACP therefore
    directly supports Autonomic Networking functions, as described in
    \[[RFC8993](#RFC8993){.xref}\]. For example, GRASP (\"[GeneRic
    Autonomic Signaling Protocol (GRASP)](#RFC8990){.xref}\"
    \[[RFC8990](#RFC8990){.xref}\]) runs securely inside the ACP and
    depends on the ACP as its \"security and transport
    substrate\".[¶](#section-1-15.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-15.1}
2.  [A controller or network management system can use ACP to securely
    bootstrap network devices in remote locations, even if the (data
    plane) network in between is not yet configured; no bootstrap
    configuration that is dependent on the data plane is required. An
    example of such a secure bootstrap process is described in
    \"[Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key Infrastructure
    (BRSKI)](#RFC8995){.xref}\"
    \[[RFC8995](#RFC8995){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-15.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-15.2}
3.  [An operator can use ACP to access remote devices using protocols
    such as Secure SHell (SSH) or Network Configuration Protocol
    (NETCONF), even if the network is misconfigured or
    unconfigured.[¶](#section-1-15.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-15.3}

This document describes these purposes as use cases for the ACP in
[Section 3](#usage){.xref}, and it defines the requirements in [Section
4](#requirements){.xref}. [Section 5](#overview){.xref} gives an
overview of how the ACP is constructed.[¶](#section-1-16){.pilcrow}

The normative part of this document starts with [Section
6](#self-creation){.xref}, where the ACP is specified. [Section
7](#acp-l2-switches){.xref} explains how to support ACP on Layer 2 (L2)
switches (normative). [Section 8](#workarounds){.xref} explains how
non-ACP nodes and networks can be integrated
(normative).[¶](#section-1-17){.pilcrow}

The remaining sections are non-normative. [Section 10](#benefit){.xref}
reviews the benefits of the ACP (after all the details have been
defined). [Section 9](#operational){.xref} provides operational
recommendations. [Appendix A](#further){.xref} provides additional
background and describes possible extensions that were not applicable
for this specification but were considered important to document. There
are no dependencies on [Appendix A](#further){.xref} in order to build a
complete working and interoperable ACP according to this
document.[¶](#section-1-18){.pilcrow}

The ACP provides secure IPv6 connectivity; therefore, it can be used for
secure connectivity not only for self-management as required for the ACP
in \[[RFC7575](#RFC7575){.xref}\] but also for traditional (centralized)
management. The ACP can be implemented and operated without any other
components of Autonomic Networks, except for GRASP. ACP relies on
per-link Discovery Unsolicited Link-Local (DULL) GRASP (see [Section
6.4](#discovery-grasp){.xref}) to auto-discover ACP neighbors and
includes the ACP GRASP instance to provide service discovery for clients
of the ACP (see [Section 6.9](#GRASP){.xref}), including for its own
maintenance of ACP certificates.[¶](#section-1-19){.pilcrow}

The document \[[RFC8368](#RFC8368){.xref}\] describes how the ACP can be
used alone to provide secure and stable connectivity for autonomic and
non-autonomic OAM applications, specifically for the case of current
non-autonomic networks and/or nodes. That document also explains how
existing management solutions can leverage the ACP in parallel with
traditional management models, when to use the ACP, and how to integrate
with potentially IPv4-only OAM backends.[¶](#section-1-20){.pilcrow}

Combining ACP with Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key Infrastructure
(BRSKI) (see \[[RFC8995](#RFC8995){.xref}\]) results in the \"Autonomic
Network Infrastructure\" (ANI) as defined in
\[[RFC8993](#RFC8993){.xref}\], which provides autonomic connectivity
(from ACP) with secure zero-touch (automated) bootstrap from BRSKI. The
ANI itself does not constitute an Autonomic Network, but it allows the
building of more or less Autonomic Networks on top of it, using either
centralized automation in SDN style (see \"[Software-Defined Networking
(SDN): Layers and Architecture Terminology](#RFC7426){.xref}\"
\[[RFC7426](#RFC7426){.xref}\]) or distributed automation via Autonomic
Service Agents (ASA) and/or Autonomic Functions (AF), or a mixture of
both. See \[[RFC8993](#RFC8993){.xref}\] for more
information.[¶](#section-1-21){.pilcrow}

### [1.1.](#section-1.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Applicability and Scope](#name-applicability-and-scope){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-applicability-and-scope}

Please see the following Terminology section ([Section
2](#terminology){.xref}) for explanations of terms used in this
section.[¶](#section-1.1-1){.pilcrow}

The design of the ACP as defined in this document is considered to be
applicable to all types of \"professionally managed\" networks: Service
Provider, Local Area Network (LAN), Metropolitan Area Network
(MAN/Metro), Wide Area Network (WAN), Enterprise Information Technology
(IT) and [Operational Technology](#ot){.xref} (OT) networks. The ACP can
operate equally on Layer 3 (L3) equipment and on L2 equipment such as
bridges (see [Section 7](#acp-l2-switches){.xref}). The hop-by-hop
authentication, integrity protection, and confidentiality mechanism used
by the ACP is defined to be negotiable; therefore, it can be extended to
environments with different protocol preferences. The minimum
implementation requirements in this document attempt to achieve maximum
interoperability by requiring support for multiple options depending on
the type of device: IPsec (see \"[Security Architecture for the Internet
Protocol](#RFC4301){.xref}\" \[[RFC4301](#RFC4301){.xref}\]) and
Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS, see [Section
6.8.4](#DTLS){.xref}).[¶](#section-1.1-2){.pilcrow}

The implementation footprint of the ACP consists of Public Key
Infrastructure (PKI) code for the ACP certificate including EST (see
\"[Enrollment over Secure Transport](#RFC7030){.xref}\"
\[[RFC7030](#RFC7030){.xref}\]), GRASP, UDP, TCP, and Transport Layer
Security (TLS, see [Section 6.1](#tls){.xref}). For more information
regarding the security and reliability of GRASP and for EST, the ACP
secure channel protocol used (such as IPsec or DTLS), and an instance of
IPv6 packet forwarding and routing via RPL, see \"[RPL: IPv6 Routing
Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks](#RFC6550){.xref}\"
\[[RFC6550](#RFC6550){.xref}\], which is separate from routing and
forwarding for the data plane (user
traffic).[¶](#section-1.1-3){.pilcrow}

The ACP uses only IPv6 to avoid the complexity of dual-stack (both IPv6
and IPv4) ACP operations. Nevertheless, it can be integrated without any
changes to otherwise IPv4-only network devices. The data plane itself
would not need to change, and it could continue to be IPv4 only. For
such IPv4-only devices, IPv6 itself would be additional implementation
footprint that is only required for the
ACP.[¶](#section-1.1-4){.pilcrow}

The protocol choices of the ACP are primarily based on wide use and
support in networks and devices, well-understood security properties,
and required scalability. The ACP design is an attempt to produce the
lowest risk combination of existing technologies and protocols to build
a widely applicable, operational network management
solution.[¶](#section-1.1-5){.pilcrow}

RPL was chosen because it requires a smaller routing table footprint in
large networks compared to other routing protocols with an autonomically
configured single area. The deployment experience of large-scale
Internet of Things (IoT) networks serves as the basis for wide
deployment experience with RPL. The profile chosen for RPL in the ACP
does not leverage any RPL-specific forwarding plane features (IPv6
extension headers), making its implementation a pure control plane
software requirement.[¶](#section-1.1-6){.pilcrow}

GRASP is the only completely novel protocol used in the ACP, and this
choice was necessary because there is no existing protocol suitable for
providing the necessary functions to the ACP, so GRASP was developed to
fill that gap.[¶](#section-1.1-7){.pilcrow}

The ACP design can be applicable to devices constrained with respect to
CPU and memory, and to networks constrained with respect to bitrate and
reliability, but this document does not attempt to define the most
constrained type of devices or networks to which the ACP is applicable.
RPL and DTLS for ACP secure channels are two protocol choices already
making ACP more applicable to constrained environments. Support for
constrained devices in this specification is opportunistic, but not
complete, because the reliable transport for GRASP (see [Section
6.9.2](#GRASP-substrate){.xref}) only specifies TCP/TLS. See [Appendix
A.8](#reuse-acp){.xref} for discussions about how future standards or
proprietary extensions and/or variations of the ACP could better meet
expectations that are different from those upon which the current design
is based, including supporting constrained devices
better.[¶](#section-1.1-8){.pilcrow}

This document introduces or uses the following terms (sorted
alphabetically). Introduced terms are explained on first use, so this
list is for reference only.[¶](#section-2-3){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

ACP:

Autonomic Control Plane. The [autonomic function](#af-def){.xref} as
defined in this document. It provides secure, zero-touch (automated)
transitive (network-wide) IPv6 connectivity for all nodes in the same
ACP domain as well as a GRASP instance running across this ACP IPv6
connectivity. The ACP is primarily meant to be used as a component of
the [ANI](#ani-def){.xref} to enable [Autonomic
Networks](#an-def){.xref}, but it can equally be used in simple ANI
networks (with no other autonomic functions) or completely by
itself.[¶](#section-2-4.2){.pilcrow}

ACP address:

An IPv6 address assigned to the ACP node. It is stored in the
[acp-node-name](#acp-node-name-def){.xref} of the [ACP
certificate](#domcert-def){.xref}.[¶](#section-2-4.4){.pilcrow}

ACP address range or set:

The ACP address may imply a range or set of addresses that the node can
assign for different purposes. This address range or set is derived by
the node from the format of the ACP address called the addressing
sub-scheme.[¶](#section-2-4.6){.pilcrow}

::: {#domcert-def}
ACP certificate:
:::

A Local Device IDentity ([LDevID](#ldevid){.xref}) certificate
conforming to \"[Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate
and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile](#RFC5280){.xref}\"
\[[RFC5280](#RFC5280){.xref}\] that carries the
[acp-node-name](#acp-node-name-def){.xref}, which is used by the ACP to
learn its address in the ACP and to derive and cryptographically assert
its membership in the ACP domain. In the context of the ANI, the ACP
certificate is also called the ANI certificate. In the context of AN,
the ACP certificate is also called the AN
certificate.[¶](#section-2-4.8){.pilcrow}

ACP connect interface:

An interface on an ACP node that provides access to the ACP for
non-ACP-capable nodes without using an ACP secure channel. See [Section
8.1.1](#NMS){.xref}.[¶](#section-2-4.10){.pilcrow}

ACP domain:

The ACP domain is the set of nodes with [ACP
certificates](#domcert-def){.xref} that allow them to authenticate each
other as members of the ACP domain. See also [Section
6.2.3](#certcheck){.xref}.[¶](#section-2-4.12){.pilcrow}

::: {#acp-loopback-def}
ACP loopback interface:
:::

The loopback interface in the ACP [VRF](#vrf-def){.xref} that has the
ACP address assigned to it. See [Section
6.13.5.1](#ACP-loopback){.xref}.[¶](#section-2-4.14){.pilcrow}

ACP network:

The ACP network comprises all the nodes that have access to the ACP. It
is the set of active and transitively connected nodes of an ACP domain
plus all nodes that get access to the ACP of that domain via ACP edge
nodes.[¶](#section-2-4.16){.pilcrow}

ACP (ULA) prefix(es):

The /48 IPv6 address prefixes used across the ACP. In the normal or
simple case, the ACP has one [Unique Local Address
(ULA)](#ula-def){.xref} prefix, see [Section 6.11](#addressing){.xref}.
The ACP routing table may include multiple ULA prefixes if the rsub
option is used to create addresses from more than one ULA prefix. See
[Section 6.2.2](#domcert-acpinfo){.xref}. The ACP may also include
non-ULA prefixes if those are configured on ACP connect interfaces. See
[Section 8.1.1](#NMS){.xref}.[¶](#section-2-4.18){.pilcrow}

ACP secure channel:

A channel authenticated via [ACP certificates](#domcert-def){.xref}
providing integrity protection and confidentiality through encryption.
These channels are established between (normally) adjacent ACP nodes to
carry ACP [VRF](#vrf-def){.xref} traffic in-band over the same links and
paths as data plane traffic but isolate it from the data plane traffic
and secure it.[¶](#section-2-4.20){.pilcrow}

ACP secure channel protocol:

The protocol used to build an ACP secure channel, e.g., Internet Key
Exchange Protocol version 2 (IKEv2) with IPsec or
DTLS.[¶](#section-2-4.22){.pilcrow}

ACP virtual interface:

An interface in the ACP [VRF](#vrf-def){.xref} mapped to one or more ACP
secure channels. See [Section
6.13.5](#ACP_interfaces){.xref}.[¶](#section-2-4.24){.pilcrow}

### [3.2.](#section-3.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Secure Bootstrap over an Unconfigured Network](#name-secure-bootstrap-over-an-un){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-secure-bootstrap-over-an-un}

Today, bootstrapping a new node typically requires all nodes between a
controlling node such as an SDN controller (see
\[[RFC7426](#RFC7426){.xref}\]) and the new node to be completely and
correctly addressed, configured, and secured. Bootstrapping and
configuration of a network happens in rings around the controller \--
configuring each ring of devices before the next one can be
bootstrapped. Without console access (for example, through an
out-of-band network), it is not possible today to make devices securely
reachable before having configured the entire network leading up to
them.[¶](#section-3.2-1){.pilcrow}

With the ACP, secure bootstrap of new devices and whole new networks can
happen without requiring any configuration of unconfigured devices along
the path. As long as all devices along the path support ACP and a
zero-touch bootstrap mechanism such as BRSKI, the ACP across a whole
network of unconfigured devices can be brought up without operator
and/or provisioning intervention. The ACP also offers additional
security for any bootstrap mechanism because it can provide the
encrypted discovery (via ACP GRASP) of registrars or other bootstrap
servers by bootstrap proxies connecting to nodes that are to be
bootstrapped. The ACP encryption hides the identities of the
communicating entities (pledge and registrar), making it more difficult
to learn which network node might be attackable. The ACP certificate can
also be used to end-to-end encrypt the bootstrap communication between
such proxies and server. Note that bootstrapping here includes not only
the first step that can be provided by BRSKI (secure keys), but also
later stages where configuration is
bootstrapped.[¶](#section-3.2-2){.pilcrow}

### [3.3.](#section-3.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Permanent Reachability Independent of the Data Plane](#name-permanent-reachability-inde){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-permanent-reachability-inde}

Today, most critical control plane protocols and OAM protocols use the
data plane of the network. This leads to often undesirable dependencies
between the control and OAM plane on one side and the data plane on the
other: only if the forwarding and control plane of the data plane are
configured correctly, will the data plane and the OAM and/or control
plane work as expected.[¶](#section-3.3-1){.pilcrow}

Data plane connectivity can be affected by errors and faults. Examples
include misconfigurations that make AAA (Authentication, Authorization,
and Accounting) servers unreachable or that can lock an administrator
out of a device; routing or addressing issues can make a device
unreachable; and shutting down interfaces over which a current
management session is running can lock an administrator irreversibly out
of the device. Traditionally only out-of-band access via a serial
console or Ethernet management port can help recover from such
issues.[¶](#section-3.3-2){.pilcrow}

Data plane dependencies also affect applications in a NOC such as SDN
controller applications: certain network changes are hard to implement
today because the change itself may affect reachability of the devices.
Examples include address or mask changes, routing changes, or security
policies. Today such changes require precise, hop-by-hop
planning.[¶](#section-3.3-3){.pilcrow}

Note that specific control plane functions for the data plane often
depend on the ability to forward their packets via the data plane:
sending aliveness and routing protocol signaling packets across the data
plane to verify reachability, using IPv4 signaling packets for IPv4
routing and IPv6 signaling packets for IPv6
routing.[¶](#section-3.3-4){.pilcrow}

Assuming appropriate implementation (see [Section
6.13.2](#general_addressing){.xref} for more details), the ACP provides
reachability that is independent of the data plane. This allows the
control plane and OAM plane to operate more
robustly:[¶](#section-3.3-5){.pilcrow}

-   [For management plane protocols, the ACP provides the functionality
    of a Virtual out-of-Band (VooB) channel, by providing connectivity
    to all nodes regardless of their data plane configuration, and
    routing and forwarding
    tables.[¶](#section-3.3-6.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.3-6.1}
-   [For control plane protocols, the ACP allows their operation even
    when the data plane is temporarily faulty, or during transitional
    events, such as routing changes, which may affect the control plane
    at least temporarily. This is specifically important for autonomic
    service agents, which could affect data plane
    connectivity.[¶](#section-3.3-6.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.3-6.2}

The document [\"Using Autonomic Control Plane for Stable Connectivity of
Network OAM\"](#RFC8368){.xref} \[[RFC8368](#RFC8368){.xref}\] explains
this use case for the ACP in significantly more detail and explains how

The following requirements were identified for the design of the ACP

requirements are informative. The ACP as specified in the normative
parts of this document is meeting or exceeding these use case
requirements:[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

ACP1:

:   ::: {#acp1}
    The ACP should provide robust connectivity: as far as possible, it
    should be independent of configured addressing, configuration, and
    routing. Requirements 2 and 3 build on this requirement, but they
    also have value on their own.[¶](#acp1){.pilcrow}
    :::

:   

ACP2:
:   The ACP must have a separate address space from the data plane. This
    separate address space provides traceability, ease of debugging,
    separation from data plane, and infrastructure security (filtering
    based on known address space).[¶](#section-4-2.2){.pilcrow}
:   

ACP3:
:   The ACP must use an autonomically managed address space. An
    autonomically managed address space provides ease of bootstrap and
    setup (\"autonomic\"), and robustness (the administrator cannot
    break network easily). This document uses ULA for this purpose, see
    \[[RFC4193](#RFC4193){.xref}\].[¶](#section-4-2.3){.pilcrow}
:   

ACP4:

:   ::: {#acp4}
    The ACP must be generic, that is, it must be usable by all the
    functions and protocols of the ANI. Clients of the ACP must not be
    tied to a particular application or transport
    protocol.[¶](#acp4){.pilcrow}
    :::

:   

ACP5:
:   The ACP must provide security: messages coming through the ACP must
    be authenticated to be from a trusted node, and it is very strongly
    recommended that they be encrypted.[¶](#section-4-2.5){.pilcrow}
:   

The explanation for [ACP4](#acp4){.xref} is as follows: in a fully
Autonomic Network (AN), all newly written ASAs could potentially
communicate with each other exclusively via GRASP, and if that were the
only requirement for the ACP, it would not need to provide IPv6-layer
connectivity between nodes, but only GRASP connectivity. Nevertheless,
because ACP also intends to support non-autonomous networks, it is
crucial to support IPv6-layer connectivity across the ACP to support any
transport-layer and application-layer
protocols.[¶](#section-4-3){.pilcrow}

The ACP operates hop-by-hop because this interaction can be built on
IPv6 link-local addressing, which is autonomic, and has no dependency on
configuration (requirement [ACP1](#acp1){.xref}). It may be necessary to
have ACP connectivity across non-ACP nodes, for example, to link ACP
nodes over the general Internet. This is possible, but it introduces a
dependency on stable and/or resilient routing over the non-ACP hops (see
[Section 8.2](#remote-acp-neighbors){.xref}).[¶](#section-4-4){.pilcrow}

When a node has an ACP certificate (see [Section
6.2.1](#acp-certificates){.xref}) and is enabled to bring up the ACP
(see [Section 9.3.5](#node-enable){.xref}), it will create its ACP
without any configuration as follows. For details, see [Section
6](#self-creation){.xref} and following
sections:[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

1.  [The node creates a VRF instance or a similar virtual context for
    the ACP.[¶](#section-5-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-5-2.1}
2.  [The node assigns its ULA IPv6 address (prefix) (see [Section

    (see [Section 6.2.2](#domcert-acpinfo){.xref}) of its ACP
    certificate (see [Section 6.2.1](#acp-certificates){.xref}), to an
    ACP loopback interface (see [Section 6.11](#addressing){.xref}) and
    connects this interface to the ACP
    VRF.[¶](#section-5-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-5-2.2}
3.  [The node establishes a list of candidate peer adjacencies and
    candidate channel types to try for the adjacency. This is automatic
    for all candidate link-local adjacencies (see [Section
    6.4](#discovery-grasp){.xref}) across all native interfaces (see
    [Section 9.3.4](#if-enable-auto){.xref}). If a candidate peer is
    discovered via multiple interfaces, this will result in one
    adjacency per interface. If the ACP node has multiple interfaces
    connecting to the same subnet across which it is also operating as
    an L2 switch in the data plane, it employs methods for ACP with L2
    switching, see [Section
    7](#acp-l2-switches){.xref}.[¶](#section-5-2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-5-2.3}
4.  [For each entry in the candidate adjacency list, the node negotiates
    a secure tunnel using the candidate channel types. See [Section
    6.6](#channel-selection){.xref}.[¶](#section-5-2.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-5-2.4}
5.  [The node authenticates the peer node during secure channel setup

This section specifies the components and steps to set up an ACP. The
ACP is automatically self-creating, which makes it \"indestructible\"
against most changes to the data plane, including misconfigurations of
routing, addressing, NAT, firewall, or any other traffic policy filters
that would inadvertently or otherwise unavoidably also impact the
management plane traffic, such as the actual operator command-line
interface (CLI) session or controller NETCONF session through which the
configuration changes to the data plane are
executed.[¶](#section-6-1){.pilcrow}

Physical misconfiguration of wiring between ACP nodes will also not
break the ACP. As long as there is a transitive physical path between
ACP nodes, the ACP should be able to recover given that it automatically
operates across all interfaces of the ACP nodes and automatically
determines paths between them.[¶](#section-6-2){.pilcrow}

Attacks against the network via incorrect routing or addressing
information for the data plane will not impact the ACP. Even impaired
ACP nodes will have a significantly reduced attack surface against
malicious misconfiguration because only very limited ACP or interface
up/down configuration can affect the ACP, and depending on their
specific designs, these types of attacks could also be eliminated. See
more in [Section 9.3](#enabling-acp){.xref} and [Section

An ACP node can be a router, switch, controller, NMS host, or any other
IPv6-capable node. Initially, it [MUST]{.bcp14} have its ACP
certificate, as well as an (empty) ACP adjacency table (described in

### [6.2.](#section-6.2){.section-number .selfRef} [ACP Domain, Certificate, and Network](#name-acp-domain-certificate-and-){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-acp-domain-certificate-and-}

The ACP relies on group security. An ACP domain is a group of nodes that
trust each other to participate in ACP operations such as creating ACP
secure channels in an autonomous, peer-to-peer fashion between ACP
domain members via protocols such as IPsec. To authenticate and
authorize another ACP member node with access to the ACP domain, each
ACP member requires keying material: an ACP node [MUST]{.bcp14} have an
LDevID certificate and information about one or more TAs as required for
the ACP domain membership check ([Section
6.2.3](#certcheck){.xref}).[¶](#section-6.2-1){.pilcrow}

Manual keying via shared secrets is not usable for an ACP domain because
it would require a single shared secret across all current and future
ACP domain members to meet the expectation of autonomous, peer-to-peer
establishment of ACP secure channels between any ACP domain members.
Such a single shared secret would be an unacceptable security weakness.
Asymmetric keying material (public keys) without certificates does not
provide the mechanism to authenticate ACP domain membership in an
autonomous, peer-to-peer fashion for current and future ACP domain
members.[¶](#section-6.2-2){.pilcrow}

The LDevID certificate is henceforth called the ACP certificate. The TA
is the CA root certificate of the ACP
domain.[¶](#section-6.2-3){.pilcrow}

The ACP does not mandate specific mechanisms by which this keying
material is provisioned into the ACP node. It only requires that the
certificate comply with [Section 6.2.1](#acp-certificates){.xref},
specifically that it have the acp-node-name as specified in [Section
6.2.2](#domcert-acpinfo){.xref} in its domain certificate as well as
those of candidate ACP peers. See [Appendix A.2](#bootstrap){.xref} for
more information about enrollment or provisioning
options.[¶](#section-6.2-4){.pilcrow}

This document uses the term ACP in many places where the Autonomic
Networking reference documents \[[RFC7575](#RFC7575){.xref}\] and
\[[RFC8993](#RFC8993){.xref}\] use the word autonomic. This is done
because those reference documents consider (only) fully Autonomic
Networks and nodes, but the support of ACP does not require the support
for other components of Autonomic Networks except for the reliance on
GRASP and the providing of security and transport for GRASP. Therefore,
the word autonomic might be misleading to operators interested in only
the ACP.[¶](#section-6.2-5){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC7575](#RFC7575){.xref}\] defines the term \"autonomic domain\" as
a collection of autonomic nodes. ACP nodes do not need to be fully
autonomic, but when they are, then the ACP domain is an autonomic
domain. Likewise, \[[RFC8993](#RFC8993){.xref}\] defines the term
\"domain certificate\" as the certificate used in an autonomic domain.
The ACP certificate is that domain certificate when ACP nodes are
(fully) autonomic nodes. Finally, this document uses the term ACP
network to refer to the network created by active ACP nodes in an ACP
domain. The ACP network itself can extend beyond ACP nodes through the
mechanisms described in [Section
8.1](#ACPconnect){.xref}.[¶](#section-6.2-6){.pilcrow}

ACP nodes [MUST]{.bcp14} support handling ACP certificates, TA
certificates, and certificate chain certificates (henceforth just called
certificates in this section) with RSA public keys and certificates with
Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) public
keys.[¶](#section-6.2.1-2){.pilcrow}

ACP nodes [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} support certificates with RSA public keys
of less than a 2048-bit modulus or curves with group order of less than
256 bits. They [MUST]{.bcp14} support certificates with RSA public keys
with 2048-bit modulus and [MAY]{.bcp14} support longer RSA keys. They
[MUST]{.bcp14} support certificates with ECC public keys using NIST
P-256 curves and [SHOULD]{.bcp14} support P-384 and P-521
curves.[¶](#section-6.2.1-3){.pilcrow}

ACP nodes [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} support certificates with RSA public keys
whose modulus is less than 2048 bits, or certificates whose ECC public
keys are in groups whose order is less than 256 bits. RSA signing
certificates with 2048-bit public keys [MUST]{.bcp14} be supported, and
such certificates with longer public keys [MAY]{.bcp14} be supported.
ECDSA certificates using the NIST P-256 curve [MUST]{.bcp14} be
supported, and such certificates using the P-384 and P-521 curves
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} be supported.[¶](#section-6.2.1-4){.pilcrow}

ACP nodes [MUST]{.bcp14} support RSA certificates that are signed by RSA
signatures over the SHA-256 digest of the contents and [SHOULD]{.bcp14}
additionally support SHA-384 and SHA-512 digests in such signatures. The
same requirements for digest usage in certificate signatures apply to
Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) certificates, and
additionally, ACP nodes [MUST]{.bcp14} support ECDSA signatures on ECDSA
certificates.[¶](#section-6.2.1-5){.pilcrow}

The ACP certificate [SHOULD]{.bcp14} use an RSA key and an RSA signature
when the ACP certificate is intended to be used not only for ACP
authentication but also for other purposes. The ACP certificate
[MAY]{.bcp14} use an ECC key and an ECDSA signature if the ACP
certificate is only used for ACP and ANI authentication and
authorization.[¶](#section-6.2.1-6){.pilcrow}

Any secure channel protocols used for the ACP as specified in this
document or extensions of this document [MUST]{.bcp14} therefore support
authentication (e.g., signing), starting with these types of
certificates. See \[[RFC8422](#RFC8422){.xref}\] for more
information.[¶](#section-6.2.1-7){.pilcrow}

The reason for these choices are as follows: as of 2020, RSA is still
more widely used than ECC, therefore the [MUST]{.bcp14}-level
requirements for RSA. ECC offers equivalent security at
(logarithmically) shorter key lengths (see
\[[RFC8422](#RFC8422){.xref}\]). This can be beneficial especially in
the presence of constrained bandwidth or constrained nodes in an ACP/ANI
network. Some ACP functions such as GRASP peer-to-peer across the ACP
require end-to-end/any-to-any authentication and authorization,
therefore ECC can only reliably be used in the ACP when it
[MUST]{.bcp14} be supported on all ACP nodes. RSA signatures are
mandatory to be supported also for ECC certificates because the CAs
themselves may not support ECC yet.[¶](#section-6.2.1-8){.pilcrow}

The ACP certificate [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be used for any authentication
between nodes with ACP domain certificates (ACP nodes and NOC nodes)
where a required authorization condition is ACP domain membership, such
as ACP node to NOC/OAM end-to-end security and ASA to ASA end-to-end
security. [Section 6.2.3](#certcheck){.xref} defines this \"ACP domain
membership check\". The uses of this check that are standardized in this
document are for the establishment of hop-by-hop ACP secure channels
([Section 6.8](#associations){.xref}) and for ACP GRASP ([Section
6.9.2](#GRASP-substrate){.xref}) end to end via
TLS.[¶](#section-6.2.1-9){.pilcrow}

The ACP domain membership check requires a minimum number of elements in
a certificate as described in [Section 6.2.3](#certcheck){.xref}. The
identity of a node in the ACP is carried via the acp-node-name as
defined in [Section
6.2.2](#domcert-acpinfo){.xref}.[¶](#section-6.2.1-10){.pilcrow}

To support Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) directly with the key in
the ACP certificate, ACP certificates with ECC keys need to indicate
that they are ECDH capable: if the X.509 v3 keyUsage extension is
present, the keyAgreement bit must then be set. Note that this option is
not required for any of the required ciphersuites in this document and
may not be supported by all CAs.[¶](#section-6.2.1-11){.pilcrow}

Any other fields of the ACP certificate are to be populated as required
by \[[RFC5280](#RFC5280){.xref}\]. As long as they are compliant with
\[[RFC5280](#RFC5280){.xref}\], any other field of an ACP certificate
can be set as desired by the operator of the ACP domain through the
appropriate ACP registrar and/or ACP CA procedures. For example, other
fields may be required for purposes other than those that the ACP
certificate is intended to be used for (such as elements of a
SubjectName).[¶](#section-6.2.1-12){.pilcrow}

For further certificate details, ACP certificates may follow the
recommendations from
\[[CABFORUM](#CABFORUM){.xref}\].[¶](#section-6.2.1-13){.pilcrow}

For diagnostic and other operational purposes, it is beneficial to copy
the device-identifying fields of the node\'s IDevID certificate into the
ACP certificate, such as the \"serialNumber\" attribute
(\[[X.520](#X.520){.xref}\], Section 6.2.9) in the subject field
distinguished name encoding. Note that this is not the certificate
serial-number. See also \[[RFC8995](#RFC8995){.xref}\], [Section
2.3.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8995#section-2.3.1){.relref}.
This can be done, for example, if it would be acceptable for the
device\'s \"serialNumber\" to be signaled via the Link Layer Discovery
Protocol \[[LLDP](#LLDP){.xref}\] because, like LLDP-signaled
information, the ACP certificate information can be retrieved by
neighboring nodes without further authentication and can be used either
for beneficial diagnostics or for malicious attacks. Retrieval of the
ACP certificate is possible via a (failing) attempt to set up an ACP
secure channel, and the \"serialNumber\" usually contains device type
information that may help to more quickly determine working
exploits/attacks against the device.[¶](#section-6.2.1-14){.pilcrow}

Note that there is no intention to constrain authorization within the
ACP or Autonomic Networks using the ACP to just the ACP domain
membership check as defined in this document. It can be extended or
modified with additional requirements. Such future authorizations can
use and require additional elements in certificates or policies or even
additional certificates. See [Section 6.2.5](#domcert-maint){.xref} for
the additional check against the id-kp-cmcRA extended key usage
attribute (\"[Certificate Management over CMS (CMC)
Updates](#RFC6402){.xref}\" \[[RFC6402](#RFC6402){.xref}\]), and see

The acp-node-name in [Figure 2](#acp-dominfo-abnf){.xref} is the ABNF
definition (\"[Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications:
ABNF](#RFC5234){.xref}\" \[[RFC5234](#RFC5234){.xref}\]) of the ACP Node
Name. An ACP certificate [MUST]{.bcp14} carry this information. It
[MUST]{.bcp14} contain an otherName field in the X.509 Subject
Alternative Name extension, and the otherName [MUST]{.bcp14} contain an
AcpNodeName as described in [Section
6.2.2](#domcert-acpinfo){.xref}.[¶](#section-6.2.2-5){.pilcrow}

Nodes complying with this specification [MUST]{.bcp14} be able to
receive their ACP address through the domain certificate, in which case
their own ACP certificate [MUST]{.bcp14} have a 32HEXDIG acp-address
field. The acp-address field is case insensitive because ABNF HEXDIG is.
It is recommended to encode acp-address with lowercase letters. Nodes
complying with this specification [MUST]{.bcp14} also be able to
authenticate nodes as ACP domain members or ACP secure channel peers
when they have a zero-value acp-address field and as ACP domain members
(but not as ACP secure channel peers) when the acp-address field is
omitted from their AcpNodeName. See [Section
6.2.3](#certcheck){.xref}.[¶](#section-6.2.2-6){.pilcrow}

The acp-domain-name is used to indicate the ACP domain across which ACP
nodes authenticate and authorize each other, for example, to build ACP
secure channels to each other, see [Section 6.2.3](#certcheck){.xref}.
The acp-domain-name [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be the FQDN of an Internet domain
owned by the network administration of the ACP and ideally reserved to
only be used for the ACP. In this specification, it serves as a name for
the ACP that ideally is globally unique. When acp-domain-name is a
globally unique name, collision of ACP addresses across different ACP
domains can only happen due to ULA hash collisions (see [Section
6.11.2](#scheme){.xref}). Using different acp-domain-names, operators
can distinguish multiple ACPs even when using the same
TA.[¶](#section-6.2.2-7){.pilcrow}

To keep the encoding simple, there is no consideration for
internationalized acp-domain-names. The acp-node-name is not intended
for end-user consumption. There is no protection against an operator
picking any domain name for an ACP whether or not the operator can claim
to own the domain name. Instead, the domain name only serves as a hash
seed for the ULA and for diagnostics for the operator. Therefore, any
operator owning only an internationalized domain name should be able to
pick an equivalently unique 7-bit ASCII acp-domain-name string
representing the internationalized domain
name.[¶](#section-6.2.2-8){.pilcrow}

The routing-subdomain is a string that can be constructed from the
acp-node-name, and it is used in the hash creation of the ULA (see
[Section 6.11.2](#scheme){.xref}). The presence of the rsub component
allows a single ACP domain to employ multiple /48 ULA prefixes. See
[Appendix A.6](#domain-usage){.xref} for example use
cases.[¶](#section-6.2.2-9){.pilcrow}

The optional extensions field is used for future standardized extensions
to this specification. It [MUST]{.bcp14} be ignored if present and not
understood.[¶](#section-6.2.2-10){.pilcrow}

    against one of the TAs associated with the ACP node\'s ACP
    certificate (see [Section 6.2.4](#trust-anchors){.xref}). This
    includes verification of the validity (lifetime) of the certificates

    4.2.2.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5280#section-4.2.2.1){.relref}),
    then the peer\'s certificate [MUST]{.bcp14} be valid according to
    those mechanisms when they are available: an OCSP check for the
    peer\'s certificate across the ACP must succeed, or the peer\'s
    certificate must not be listed in the CRL retrieved from the CRLDP.
    These mechanisms are not available when the ACP node has no ACP or
    non-ACP connectivity to retrieve a current CRL or has no access an
    OCSP responder, and the security association protocol itself also
    has no way to communicate the CRL or OCSP
    check.[¶](#section-6.2.3-2.3.1){.pilcrow}

    Retries to learn revocation via OCSP or CRL [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be made
    using the same backoff as described in [Section
    6.7](#neighbor_verification){.xref}. If and when the ACP node then
    learns that an ACP peer\'s certificate is invalid for which [Rule
    3](#step3){.xref} had to be skipped during ACP secure channel
    establishment, then the ACP secure channel to that peer
    [MUST]{.bcp14} be closed even if this peer is the only connectivity
    to access CRL/OCSP. This applies (of course) to all ACP secure
    channels to this peer if there are multiple. The ACP secure channel
    connection [MUST]{.bcp14} be retried periodically to support the
    case that the neighbor acquires a new, valid

When checking a candidate peer\'s certificate for the purpose of

    [Figure 2](#acp-dominfo-abnf){.xref}.[¶](#step5){.pilcrow}
    :::
    :::

Technically, ACP secure channels can only be built with nodes that have
an acp-address. [Rule 5](#step5){.xref} ensures that this is taken into
account during ACP domain membership
check.[¶](#section-6.2.3-5){.pilcrow}

Nodes with an omitted acp-address field can only use their ACP domain
certificate for non-ACP secure channel authentication purposes. This
includes, for example, NMS type nodes permitted to communicate into the
ACP via [ACP connect](#ACPconnect){.xref} ([Section
8.1](#ACPconnect){.xref})[¶](#section-6.2.3-6){.pilcrow}

The special value \"0\" in an ACP certificate\'s acp-address field is
used for nodes that can and should determine their ACP address through
mechanisms other than learning it through the acp-address field in their
ACP certificate. These ACP nodes are permitted to establish ACP secure
channels. Mechanisms for those nodes to determine their ACP address are
outside the scope of this specification, but this option is defined here
so that any ACP nodes can build ACP secure channels to them according to
[Rule 5.](#step5){.xref}[¶](#section-6.2.3-7){.pilcrow}

The optional rsub field of the AcpNodeName is not relevant to the ACP
domain membership check because it only serves to structure routing and
addressing within an ACP but not to segment mutual authentication and
authorization (hence the name \"routing
subdomain\").[¶](#section-6.2.3-8){.pilcrow}

An ACP node with a realtime clock in which it has confidence
[MUST]{.bcp14} check the timestamps when performing an ACP domain
membership check, such as checking the certificate validity period in
[Step 1](#step1){.xref} and the respective times in [Step
4](#step4){.xref} for revocation information (e.g., signingTimes in
Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS)
signatures).[¶](#section-6.2.3.1-1){.pilcrow}

An ACP node without such a realtime clock [MAY]{.bcp14} ignore those
timestamp validation steps if it does not know the current time. Such an
ACP node [SHOULD]{.bcp14} obtain the current time in a secured fashion,
such as via NTP signaled through the ACP. It then ignores timestamp
validation only until the current time is known. In the absence of
implementing a secured mechanism, such an ACP node [MAY]{.bcp14} use a
current time learned in an insecure fashion in the ACP domain membership
check.[¶](#section-6.2.3.1-2){.pilcrow}

Current time [MAY]{.bcp14} be learned in an unsecured fashion, for
example, via NTP (\"[Network Time Protocol Version 4: Protocol and
Algorithms Specification](#RFC5905){.xref}\"
\[[RFC5905](#RFC5905){.xref}\]) over the same link-local IPv6 addresses
used for the ACP from neighboring ACP nodes. ACP nodes that do provide
unsecured NTP over their link-local addresses [SHOULD]{.bcp14} primarily
run NTP across the ACP and provide NTP time across the ACP only when
they have a trusted time source. Details for such NTP procedures are
beyond the scope of this specification.[¶](#section-6.2.3.1-3){.pilcrow}

Besides the ACP domain membership check, the ACP itself has no
dependency on knowing the current time, but protocols and services using
the ACP, for example, event logging, will likely need to know the
current time.[¶](#section-6.2.3.1-4){.pilcrow}

ACP nodes need TA information according to
\[[RFC5280](#RFC5280){.xref}\], [Section
6.1.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5280#section-6.1.1){.relref}
(d), typically in the form of one or more certificates of the TA to
perform certificate path validation as required by [Section 6.2.3, Rule
2](#step2){.xref}. TA information [MUST]{.bcp14} be provisioned to an
ACP node (together with its ACP domain certificate) by an ACP registrar
during initial enrollment of a candidate ACP node. ACP nodes
[MUST]{.bcp14} also support the renewal of TA information via EST as
described in [Section
6.2.5](#domcert-maint){.xref}.[¶](#section-6.2.4-1){.pilcrow}

The required information about a TA can consist of one or more
certificates as required for dealing with CA certificate renewals as
explained in Section
[4.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4210#section-4.4){.relref} of
[\"Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate Management
Protocol (CMP)\"](#RFC4210){.xref}
\[[RFC4210](#RFC4210){.xref}\]).[¶](#section-6.2.4-2){.pilcrow}

A certificate path is a chain of certificates starting at the ACP
certificate (the leaf and/or end entity), followed by zero or more
intermediate CA certificates, and ending with the TA information, which
is typically one or two self-signed certificates of the TA. The CA that
signs the ACP certificate is called the assigning CA. If there are no
intermediate CAs, then the assigning CA is the TA. Certificate path
validation authenticates that the TA associated with the ACP permits the
ACP certificate, either directly or indirectly via one or more
intermediate CA.[¶](#section-6.2.4-3){.pilcrow}

Note that different ACP nodes may have different intermediate CAs in
their certificate path and even different TA. The set of TAs for an ACP
domain must be consistent across all ACP members so that any ACP node
can authenticate any other ACP node. The protocols through which the ACP
domain membership check [Rules 1 through 3](#step1){.xref} are performed
need to support the exchange not only of the ACP nodes certificates but
also the exchange of the intermediate TA.[¶](#section-6.2.4-4){.pilcrow}

For the ACP domain membership check, ACP nodes [MUST]{.bcp14} support
certificate path validation with zero or one intermediate CA. They
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} support two intermediate CAs and two TAs (to permit
migration from one TA to another TA).[¶](#section-6.2.4-5){.pilcrow}

Certificates for an ACP [MUST]{.bcp14} only be given to nodes that are
allowed to be members of that ACP. When the signing CA relies on an ACP
registrar, the CA [MUST]{.bcp14} only sign certificates with
acp-node-name through trusted ACP registrars. In this setup, any
existing CA, unaware of the formatting of acp-node-name, can be
used.[¶](#section-6.2.4-6){.pilcrow}

These requirements can be achieved by using a TA private to the owner of
the ACP domain or potentially through appropriate contractual agreements
between the involved parties (registrar and CA). Using a public CA is
out of scope of this document.[¶](#section-6.2.4-7){.pilcrow}

A single owner can operate multiple, independent ACP domains from the
same set of TAs. Registrars must then know into which ACP a node needs
to be enrolled.[¶](#section-6.2.4-8){.pilcrow}

ACP nodes [MUST]{.bcp14} support renewal of their certificate and TA
information via EST and [MAY]{.bcp14} support other mechanisms. See
[Section 6.1](#tls){.xref} for TLS requirements. An ACP network
[MUST]{.bcp14} have at least one ACP node supporting EST server
functionality across the ACP so that EST renewal is
usable.[¶](#section-6.2.5-1){.pilcrow}

ACP nodes [SHOULD]{.bcp14} remember the GRASP O_IPv6_LOCATOR parameters
of the EST server with which they last renewed their ACP certificate.
They [SHOULD]{.bcp14} provide the ability for these EST server
parameters to also be set by the ACP registrar (see [Section
6.11.7](#acp-registrars){.xref}) that initially enrolled the ACP device
with its ACP certificate. When BRSKI is used (see
\[[RFC8995](#RFC8995){.xref}\]), the IPv6 locator of the BRSKI registrar
from the BRSKI TLS connection [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be remembered and used
for the next renewal via EST if that registrar also announces itself as
an EST server via GRASP on its ACP address (see [Section
6.2.5.1](#domcert-grasp){.xref}).[¶](#section-6.2.5-2){.pilcrow}

The EST server [MUST]{.bcp14} present a certificate that passes the ACP
domain membership check in its TLS connection setup ([Section 6.2.3,
rules 1 through 4](#step1){.xref}, not [rule 5](#step5){.xref} as this
is not for an ACP secure channel setup). The EST server certificate
[MUST]{.bcp14} also contain the id-kp-cmcRA extended key usage attribute
\[[RFC6402](#RFC6402){.xref}\], and the EST client [MUST]{.bcp14} check
its presence.[¶](#section-6.2.5-3){.pilcrow}

The additional check against the id-kp-cmcRA extended key usage
extension field ensures that clients do not fall prey to an illicit EST
server. While such illicit EST servers should not be able to support
certificate signing requests (as they are not able to elicit a signing
response from a valid CA), such an illicit EST server would be able to
provide faked CA certificates to EST clients that need to renew their CA
certificates when they expire.[¶](#section-6.2.5-4){.pilcrow}

Note that EST servers supporting multiple ACP domains will need to have
a separate certificate for each of these ACP domains and respond on a
different transport address (IPv6 address and/or TCP port). This is
easily automated on the EST server if the CA allows registrars to
request certificates with the id-kp-cmcRA extended usage extension for
themselves.[¶](#section-6.2.5-5){.pilcrow}

The objective name \"SRV.est\" indicates that the objective is an EST
server compliant with \[[RFC7030](#RFC7030){.xref}\] because \"est\" is
a registered service name (\"[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)
Procedures for the Management of the Service Name and Transport Protocol
Port Number Registry](#RFC6335){.xref}\" \[[RFC6335](#RFC6335){.xref}\])
for \[[RFC7030](#RFC7030){.xref}\]. The \'objective-value\' field
[MUST]{.bcp14} be ignored if present. Backward-compatible extensions to
\[[RFC7030](#RFC7030){.xref}\] [MAY]{.bcp14} be indicated through
\'objective-value\'. Certificate renewal options that are incompatible
with \[[RFC7030](#RFC7030){.xref}\] [MUST]{.bcp14} use a different
\'objective-name\'. Unrecognized \'objective-value\' fields (or parts
thereof if it is a partially understood structure) [MUST]{.bcp14} be
ignored.[¶](#section-6.2.5.1-5){.pilcrow}

The M_FLOOD message [MUST]{.bcp14} be sent periodically. The default
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} be 60 seconds; the value [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be operator
configurable but [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be not smaller than 60 seconds. The
frequency of sending [MUST]{.bcp14} be such that the aggregate amount of
periodic M_FLOODs from all flooding sources cause only negligible
traffic across the ACP. The time-to-live (ttl) parameter
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} be 3.5 times the period so that up to three consecutive
messages can be dropped before an announcement is considered expired. In
the example above, the ttl is 210000 msec, that is, 3.5 times 60
seconds. When a service announcer using these parameters unexpectedly
dies immediately after sending the M_FLOOD, receivers would consider it
expired 210 seconds later. When a receiver tries to connect to this dead
service before this timeout, it will experience a failing connection and
use that as an indication that the service instance is dead and select
another instance of the same service instead (from another GRASP
announcement).[¶](#section-6.2.5.1-6){.pilcrow}

The \"SRV.est\" objective(s) [SHOULD]{.bcp14} only be announced when the
ACP node knows that it can successfully communicate with a CA to perform
the EST renewal and/or rekeying operations for the ACP domain. See also

When performing renewal, the node [SHOULD]{.bcp14} attempt to connect to
the remembered EST server. If that fails, it [SHOULD]{.bcp14} attempt to
connect to an EST server learned via GRASP. The server with which
certificate renewal succeeds [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be remembered for the next

Remembering the last renewal server and preferring it provides
stickiness that can help diagnostics. It also provides some protection
against off-path, compromised ACP members announcing bogus information
into GRASP.[¶](#section-6.2.5.2-2){.pilcrow}

Renewal of certificates [SHOULD]{.bcp14} start after less than 50% of
the domain certificate lifetime so that network operations have ample
time to investigate and resolve any problems that cause a node to not
renew its domain certificate in time, and to allow prolonged periods of

The ACP node [SHOULD]{.bcp14} support revocation through CRL(s) via HTTP
from one or more CRL Distribution Points (CRLDP). The CRLDP(s)
[MUST]{.bcp14} be indicated in the domain certificate when used. If the
CRLDP URL uses an IPv6 address (ULA address when using the addressing
rules specified in this document), the ACP node will connect to the
CRLDP via the ACP. If the CRLDP uses a domain name, the ACP node will
connect to the CRLDP via the data
plane.[¶](#section-6.2.5.3-1){.pilcrow}

It is common to use domain names for CRLDP(s), but there is no
requirement for the ACP to support DNS. Any DNS lookup in the data plane
is not only a possible security issue, but it would also not indicate
whether the resolved address is meant to be reachable across the ACP.
Therefore, the use of an IPv6 address versus the use of a DNS name
doubles as an indicator whether or not to reach the CRLDP via the
ACP.[¶](#section-6.2.5.3-2){.pilcrow}

A CRLDP can be reachable across the ACP either by running it on a node
with ACP or by connecting its node via an ACP connect interface (see
[Section 8.1](#ACPconnect){.xref}).[¶](#section-6.2.5.3-3){.pilcrow}

When using a private PKI for ACP certificates, the CRL may be
need-to-know, for example, to prohibit insight into the operational
practices of the domain by tracking the growth of the CRL. In this case,
HTTPS may be chosen to provide confidentiality, especially when making
the CRL available via the data plane. Authentication and authorization
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} use ACP certificates and the ACP domain membership
check ([Section 6.2.3](#certcheck){.xref}). The CRLDP [MAY]{.bcp14} omit
the CRL verification during authentication of the peer to permit CRL
retrieval by an ACP node with a revoked ACP certificate, which can allow
the (ex) ACP node to quickly discover its ACP certificate revocation.
This may violate the desired need-to-know requirement, though. ACP nodes
[MAY]{.bcp14} support CRLDP operations via
HTTPS.[¶](#section-6.2.5.3-4){.pilcrow}

The certificate lifetime may be set to shorter lifetimes than customary
(one year) because certificate renewal is fully automated via ACP and
EST. The primary limiting factor for shorter certificate lifetimes is
the load on the EST server(s) and CA. It is therefore recommended that
ACP certificates are managed via a CA chain where the assigning CA has
enough performance to manage short-lived certificates. See also [Section
9.2.4](#sub-ca){.xref} for a discussion about an example setup achieving
this. See also \"[Support for Short-Term, Automatically Renewed (STAR)

When certificate lifetimes are sufficiently short, such as few hours,
certificate revocation may not be necessary, allowing the simplification

An ACP node may determine that its ACP certificate has expired, for
example, because the ACP node was powered down or disconnected longer
than its certificate lifetime. In this case, the ACP node
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} convert to a role of a reenrolling candidate ACP
node.[¶](#section-6.2.5.5-1){.pilcrow}

In this role, the node maintains the TA and certificate chain associated
with its ACP certificate exclusively for the purpose of reenrollment,
and it attempts (or waits) to get reenrolled with a new ACP certificate.
The details depend on the mechanisms and protocols used by the ACP
registrars.[¶](#section-6.2.5.5-2){.pilcrow}

Please refer to [Section 6.11.7](#acp-registrars){.xref} and
\[[RFC8995](#RFC8995){.xref}\] for explanations about ACP registrars and
vouchers as used in the following text. When ACP is intended to be used
without BRSKI, the details about BRSKI and vouchers in the following
text can be skipped.[¶](#section-6.2.5.5-3){.pilcrow}

When BRSKI is used (i.e., on ACP nodes that are ANI nodes), the
reenrolling candidate ACP node attempts to enroll like a candidate ACP
node (BRSKI pledge), but instead of using the ACP node\'s IDevID
certificate, it [SHOULD]{.bcp14} first attempt to use its ACP domain
certificate in the BRSKI TLS authentication. The BRSKI registrar
[MAY]{.bcp14} honor this certificate beyond its expiration date purely
for the purpose of reenrollment. Using the ACP node\'s domain
certificate allows the BRSKI registrar to learn that node\'s
acp-node-name so that the BRSKI registrar can reassign the same ACP
address information to the ACP node in the new ACP
certificate.[¶](#section-6.2.5.5-4){.pilcrow}

If the BRSKI registrar denies the use of the old ACP certificate, the
reenrolling candidate ACP node [MUST]{.bcp14} reattempt reenrollment
using its IDevID certificate as defined in BRSKI during the TLS
connection setup.[¶](#section-6.2.5.5-5){.pilcrow}

When the BRSKI connection is attempted with either with the old ACP
certificate or the IDevID certificate, the reenrolling candidate ACP
node [SHOULD]{.bcp14} authenticate the BRSKI registrar during TLS
connection setup based on its existing TA certificate chain information
associated with its old ACP certificate. The reenrolling candidate ACP
node [SHOULD]{.bcp14} only fall back to requesting a voucher from the
BRSKI registrar when this authentication fails during TLS connection
setup. As a countermeasure against attacks that attempt to force the ACP
node to forget its prior (expired) certificate and TA, the ACP node
should alternate between attempting to reenroll using its old keying
material and attempting to reenroll with its IDevID and requesting a
voucher.[¶](#section-6.2.5.5-6){.pilcrow}

When mechanisms other than BRSKI are used for ACP certificate
enrollment, the principles of the reenrolling candidate ACP node are the
same. The reenrolling candidate ACP node attempts to authenticate any
ACP registrar peers using reenrollment protocols and/or mechanisms via
its existing certificate chain and/or TA information and provides its
existing ACP certificate and other identification (such as the IDevID
certificate) as necessary to the
registrar.[¶](#section-6.2.5.5-7){.pilcrow}

Maintaining existing TA information is especially important when using
enrollment mechanisms that do not leverage a mechanism to authenticate
the ACP registrar (such as the voucher in BRSKI), and when the injection
of certificate failures could otherwise make the ACP vulnerable to
remote attacks by returning the ACP node to a \"duckling\" state in
which it accepts enrollment by any network it connects to. The (expired)
ACP certificate and ACP TA [SHOULD]{.bcp14} therefore be maintained and
attempted to be used as one possible credential for reenrollment until
new keying material is acquired.[¶](#section-6.2.5.5-8){.pilcrow}

When using BRSKI or other protocols and/or mechanisms that support
vouchers, maintaining existing TA information allows for lighter-weight
reenrollment of expired ACP certificates, especially in environments
where repeated acquisition of vouchers during the lifetime of ACP nodes
may be operationally expensive or otherwise
undesirable.[¶](#section-6.2.5.5-9){.pilcrow}

##### [6.2.5.6.](#section-6.2.5.6){.section-number .selfRef} [Failing Certificates](#name-failing-certificates){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-failing-certificates}

An ACP certificate is called failing in this document if or when the ACP
node to which the certificate was issued can determine that it was
revoked (or explicitly not renewed), or in the absence of such explicit
local diagnostics, when the ACP node fails to connect to other ACP nodes
in the same ACP domain using its ACP certificate. To determine that the
ACP certificate is the culprit of a connection failure, the peer should
pass the domain membership check ([Section 6.2.3](#certcheck){.xref}),
and connection error diagnostics should exclude other reasons for the
connection failure.[¶](#section-6.2.5.6-1){.pilcrow}

This type of failure can happen during the setup or refreshment of a
secure ACP channel connection or during any other use of the ACP
certificate, such as for the TLS connection to an EST server for the
renewal of the ACP domain certificate.[¶](#section-6.2.5.6-2){.pilcrow}

The following are examples of failing certificates that the ACP node can
only discover through connection failure: the domain certificate or any
of its signing certificates could have been revoked or may have expired,
but the ACP node cannot diagnose this condition directly by itself.
Revocation information or clock synchronization may only be available
across the ACP, but the ACP node cannot build ACP secure channels
because the ACP peers reject the ACP node\'s domain
certificate.[¶](#section-6.2.5.6-3){.pilcrow}

An ACP node [SHOULD]{.bcp14} support the option to determine whether its
ACP certificate is failing, and when it does, put itself into the role
of a reenrolling candidate ACP node as explained in [Section
6.2.5.5](#domcert-re-enroll){.xref}.[¶](#section-6.2.5.6-4){.pilcrow}

To know to which nodes to establish an ACP channel, every ACP node
maintains an adjacency table. The adjacency table contains information
about adjacent ACP nodes, at a minimum: Node-ID (the identifier of the
node inside the ACP, see [Section 6.11.3](#zone-scheme){.xref} and
[Section 6.11.5](#Vlong){.xref}), the interface on which neighbor was
discovered (by GRASP as explained below), the link-local IPv6 address of
the neighbor on that interface, and the certificate (including
acp-node-name). An ACP node [MUST]{.bcp14} maintain this adjacency
table. This table is used to determine to which neighbor an ACP
connection is established.[¶](#section-6.3-1){.pilcrow}

When the next ACP node is not directly adjacent (i.e., not on a link
connected to this node), the information in the adjacency table can be
supplemented by configuration. For example, the Node-ID and IP address
could be configured. See [Section
8.2](#remote-acp-neighbors){.xref}.[¶](#section-6.3-2){.pilcrow}

The adjacency table [MAY]{.bcp14} contain information about the validity
and trust of the adjacent ACP node\'s certificate. However, subsequent
steps [MUST]{.bcp14} always start with the ACP domain membership check
against the peer (see [Section

general, independent of their domain and trust status. The next step
determines to which of those ACP nodes an ACP connection should be
established.[¶](#section-6.3-4){.pilcrow}

### [6.4.](#section-6.4){.section-number .selfRef} [Neighbor Discovery with DULL GRASP](#name-neighbor-discovery-with-dul){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-neighbor-discovery-with-dul}

Discovery Unsolicited Link-Local (DULL) GRASP is a limited subset of
GRASP intended to operate across an insecure link-local scope. See
[Section
2.5.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8990#section-2.5.2){.relref} of
\[[RFC8990](#RFC8990){.xref}\] for its formal definition. The ACP uses
one instance of DULL GRASP for every L2 interface of the ACP node to
discover candidate ACP neighbors that are link-level adjacent. Unless
modified by policy as noted earlier ([Section 5, bullet point
2](#sec5bt2){.xref}), native interfaces (e.g., physical interfaces on
physical nodes) [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be initialized automatically to a state
in which ACP discovery can be performed, and any native interfaces with
ACP neighbors can then be brought into the ACP even if the interface is
otherwise unconfigured. Reception of packets on such otherwise
unconfigured interfaces [MUST]{.bcp14} be limited so that at first only
SLAAC (\"[IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration](#RFC4862){.xref}\"
\[[RFC4862](#RFC4862){.xref}\]) and DULL GRASP work, and then only the
following ACP secure channel setup packets work, but not any other
unnecessary traffic (e.g., no other link-local IPv6 transport stack
responders, for example).[¶](#section-6.4-1){.pilcrow}

Note that the use of the IPv6 link-local multicast address
(ALL_GRASP_NEIGHBORS) implies the need to use MLDv2 (see \"[Multicast
Listener Discovery Version 2 (MLDv2) for IPv6](#RFC3810){.xref}\"
\[[RFC3810](#RFC3810){.xref}\]) to announce the desire to receive
packets for that address. Otherwise, DULL GRASP could fail to operate
correctly in the presence of MLD-snooping switches (\"[Considerations
for Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) and Multicast Listener
Discovery (MLD) Snooping Switches](#RFC4541){.xref}\"
\[[RFC4541](#RFC4541){.xref}\]) that either do not support ACP or are
not ACP enabled because those switches would stop forwarding DULL GRASP
packets. Switches that do not support MLD snooping simply need to
operate as pure L2 bridges for IPv6 multicast packets for DULL GRASP to
work.[¶](#section-6.4-2){.pilcrow}

ACP discovery [SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} be enabled by default on non-native
interfaces. In particular, ACP discovery [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} run inside
the ACP across ACP virtual interfaces. See [Section
9.3](#enabling-acp){.xref} for further non-normative suggestions on how
to enable and disable ACP at the node and interface level. See [Section
8.2.2](#conf-tunnel){.xref} for more details about tunnels (typical
non-native interfaces). See [Section 7](#acp-l2-switches){.xref} for
extending ACP on devices operating (also) as L2
bridges.[¶](#section-6.4-3){.pilcrow}

Note: if an ACP node also implements BRSKI to enroll its ACP certificate
(see [Appendix A.2](#bootstrap){.xref} for a summary), then the above
considerations also apply to GRASP discovery for BRSKI. Each DULL
instance of GRASP set up for ACP is then also used for the discovery of
a bootstrap proxy via BRSKI when the node does not have a domain
certificate. Discovery of ACP neighbors happens only when the node does
have the certificate. The node therefore never needs to discover both a
bootstrap proxy and an ACP neighbor at the same
time.[¶](#section-6.4-4){.pilcrow}

An ACP node announces itself to potential ACP peers by use of the
\"AN_ACP\" objective. This is a synchronization objective intended to be
flooded on a single link using the GRASP Flood Synchronization (M_FLOOD)
message. In accordance with the design of the Flood Synchronization
message, a locator consisting of a specific link-local IP address, IP
protocol number, and port number will be distributed with the flooded
objective. An example of the message is

The \'objective-flags\' field is set to indicate
synchronization.[¶](#section-6.4-9){.pilcrow}

The \'loop-count\' is fixed at 1 since this is a link-local
operation.[¶](#section-6.4-10){.pilcrow}

In the above example, the [RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14} period of sending of the
objective is 60 seconds. The indicated \'ttl\' of 210000 msec means that
the objective would be cached by ACP nodes even when two out of three
messages are dropped in transit.[¶](#section-6.4-11){.pilcrow}

The \'session-id\' is a random number used for loop prevention
(distinguishing a message from a prior instance of the same message). In
DULL this field is irrelevant but has to be set according to the GRASP
specification.[¶](#section-6.4-12){.pilcrow}

The originator [MUST]{.bcp14} be the IPv6 link-local address of the
originating ACP node on the sending
interface.[¶](#section-6.4-13){.pilcrow}

The \'method-name\' in the \'objective-value\' parameter is a string
indicating the protocol available at the specified or implied locator.
It is a protocol supported by the node to negotiate a secure channel.
\"IKEv2\" as shown in [Figure 6](#an-acp-example){.xref} is the protocol
used to negotiate an IPsec secure channel.[¶](#section-6.4-14){.pilcrow}

The \'method-param\' parameter allows method-specific parameters to be
carried. This specification does not define any \'method-param\'(s) for
\"IKEv2\" or \"DTLS\". Any method-params for these two methods that are
not understood by an ACP node [MUST]{.bcp14} be ignored by
it.[¶](#section-6.4-15){.pilcrow}

The \'extension\' parameter allows the definition of method-independent
parameters. This specification does not define any extensions.
Extensions not understood by an ACP node [MUST]{.bcp14} be ignored by
it.[¶](#section-6.4-16){.pilcrow}

The \'locator-option\' is optional and is only required when the secure
channel protocol is not offered at a well-defined port number, or if
there is no well-defined port number.[¶](#section-6.4-17){.pilcrow}

IKEv2 is the actual protocol used to negotiate an IPsec connection.
GRASP therefore indicates \"IKEv2\" and not \"IPsec\". If \"IPsec\" was
used, this could mean the use of the obsolete, older version IKE (v1)
(\"[The Internet Key Exchange (IKE)](#RFC2409){.xref}\"
\[[RFC2409](#RFC2409){.xref}\]). IKEv2 has an IANA-assigned port number
500, but in [Figure 6](#an-acp-example){.xref}, the candidate ACP
neighbor is offering ACP secure channel negotiation via IKEv2 on port
15000 (purely to show through the example that GRASP allows the
indication of a port number, and it does not have to be IANA
assigned).[¶](#section-6.4-18){.pilcrow}

There is no default UDP port for DTLS, it is always locally assigned by
the node. For further details about the \"DTLS\" secure channel
protocol, see [Section
6.8.4](#DTLS){.xref}.[¶](#section-6.4-19){.pilcrow}

If a locator is included, it [MUST]{.bcp14} be an O_IPv6_LOCATOR, and
the IPv6 address [MUST]{.bcp14} be the same as the initiator address
(these are DULL requirements to minimize third-party DoS
attacks).[¶](#section-6.4-20){.pilcrow}

The secure channel methods defined in this document use \"IKEv2\" and
\"DTLS\" for \'objective-value\'. There is no distinction between IKEv2
native and GRE-IKEv2 because this is purely negotiated via
IKEv2.[¶](#section-6.4-21){.pilcrow}

A node that supports more than one secure channel protocol method needs
to flood multiple versions of the \"AN_ACP\" objective so that each
method can be accompanied by its own \'locator-option\'. This can use a
single GRASP M_FLOOD message as shown in [Figure
6](#an-acp-example){.xref}.[¶](#section-6.4-22){.pilcrow}

The primary use of DULL GRASP is to discover the link-local IPv6 address
of candidate ACP peers on subnets. The signaling of the supported secure
channel option is primarily for diagnostic purposes, but it is also
necessary for discovery when the protocol has no well-known transport
address, such as in the case of DTLS.[¶](#section-6.4-23){.pilcrow}

Note that a node serving both as an ACP node and BRSKI Join Proxy may
choose to distribute the \"AN_ACP\" objective and the respective BRSKI
in the same M_FLOOD message, since GRASP allows multiple objectives in
one message. This may be impractical, though, if ACP and BRSKI
operations are implemented via separate software modules and/or
ASAs.[¶](#section-6.4-24){.pilcrow}

The result of the discovery is the IPv6 link-local address of the
neighbor as well as its supported secure channel protocols (and the
non-standard port they are running on). It is stored in the ACP
adjacency table (see [Section 6.3](#adj-table){.xref}), which then
drives the further building of the ACP to that
neighbor.[¶](#section-6.4-25){.pilcrow}

Note that the described DULL GRASP objective intentionally does not
include the ACP node\'s ACP certificate, even though this would be
useful for diagnostics and to simplify the security exchange in ACP
secure channel security association protocols (see [Section
6.8](#associations){.xref}). The reason is that DULL GRASP messages are
periodically multicast across IPv6 subnets, and full certificates could
easily lead to fragmented IPv6 DULL GRASP multicast packets due to the
size of a certificate. This would be highly
undesirable.[¶](#section-6.4-26){.pilcrow}

To avoid attacks, the initial discovery of candidate ACP peers cannot
include any unprotected negotiation. To avoid reinventing and validating
security association mechanisms, the next step after discovering the
address of a candidate neighbor is to establish a security association
with that neighbor using a well-known security association
method.[¶](#section-6.6-1){.pilcrow}

It seems clear from the use cases that not all types of ACP nodes can or
need to connect directly to each other, nor are they able to support or
prefer all possible mechanisms. For example, IoT devices that are
codespace limited may only support DTLS because that code exists already
on them for end-to-end security, but low-end, in-ceiling L2 switches may
only want to support Media Access Control Security (MacSec, see 802.1AE
\[[MACSEC](#MACSEC){.xref}\]) because that is also supported in their
chips. Only a flexible gateway device may need to support both of these
mechanisms and potentially more. Note that MacSec is not required by any
profiles of the ACP in this specification. Instead, MacSec is mentioned
as an interesting potential secure channel protocol. Note also that the
security model allows and requires any-to-any authentication and
authorization between all ACP nodes because there is not only hop-by-hop
but also end-to-end authentication for secure
channels.[¶](#section-6.6-2){.pilcrow}

To support extensible selection of the secure channel protocol without a
single common mandatory-to-implement (MTI) protocol, an ACP node
[MUST]{.bcp14} try all the ACP secure channel protocols it supports and
that are also announced by the candidate ACP neighbor via its \"AN_ACP\"
GRASP parameters (these are called the \"feasible\" ACP secure channel
protocols).[¶](#section-6.6-3){.pilcrow}

To ensure that the selection of the secure channel protocols always
succeeds in a predictable fashion without blocking, the following rules
apply:[¶](#section-6.6-4){.pilcrow}

-   [An ACP node may choose to attempt to initiate the different
    feasible ACP secure channel protocols it supports according to its
    local policies sequentially or in parallel, but it [MUST]{.bcp14}
    support acting as a responder to all of them in
    parallel.[¶](#section-6.6-5.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.6-5.1}
-   [Once the first ACP secure channel protocol connection to a specific
    peer IPv6 address passes peer authentication, the two peers know
    each other\'s certificate because those ACP certificates are used by
    all secure channel protocols for mutual authentication. The peer
    with the higher Node-ID in the AcpNodeName of its ACP certificate
    takes on the role of the Decider towards the peer. The other peer
    takes on the role of the Follower. The Decider selects which secure
    channel protocol to ultimately
    use.[¶](#section-6.6-5.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.6-5.2}
-   [The Follower becomes passive: it does not attempt to further
    initiate ACP secure channel protocol connections with the Decider
    and does not consider it to be an error when the Decider closes
    secure channels. The Decider becomes the active party, continuing to
    attempt the setup of secure channel protocols with the Follower.
    This process terminates when the Decider arrives at the \"best\" ACP
    secure channel connection option that also works with the Follower
    (\"best\" from the Decider\'s point of
    view).[¶](#section-6.6-5.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.6-5.3}
-   [A peer with a \"0\" acp-address in its AcpNodeName takes on the
    role of Follower when peering with a node that has a non-\"0\"
    acp-address (note that this specification does not fully define the
    behavior of ACP secure channel negotiation for nodes with a \"0\"
    ACP address field, it only defines interoperability with such ACP
    nodes).[¶](#section-6.6-5.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.6-5.4}

In a simple example, ACP peer Node 1 attempts to initiate an IPsec
connection via IKEv2 to peer Node 2. The IKEv2 authentication succeeds.
Node 1 has the lower ACP address and becomes the Follower. Node 2
becomes the Decider. IKEv2 might not be the preferred ACP secure channel
protocol for the Decider Node 2. Node 2 would therefore proceed to
attempt secure channel setups with more preferred protocol options (in
its view, e.g., DTLS/UDP). If any such preferred ACP secure channel
connection of the Decider succeeds, it would close the IPsec connection.
If Node 2 has no preferred protocol option over IPsec, or no such
connection attempt from Node 2 to Node 1 succeeds, Node 2 would keep the
IPsec connection and use it.[¶](#section-6.6-6){.pilcrow}

The Decider [SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} send actual payload packets across a
secure channel until it has decided to use it. The Follower
[MAY]{.bcp14} delay linking the ACP secure channel to the ACP virtual
interface until it sees the first payload packet from the Decider up to
a maximum of 5 seconds to avoid unnecessarily linking a secure channel
that will be terminated as undesired by the Decider shortly
afterward.[¶](#section-6.6-7){.pilcrow}

The following sequence of steps show this example in more detail. Each
step is tagged with \[\<step#\>{:\<connection>}\]. The connection is
included to more easily distinguish which of the two competing
connections the step belongs to, one initiated by Node 1, one initiated
by Node 2.[¶](#section-6.6-8){.pilcrow}

:   

All this negotiation is in the context of an L2 interface. The Decider
and Follower will build ACP connections to each other on every L2
interface that they both connect to. An autonomic node [MUST
NOT]{.bcp14} assume that neighbors with the same L2 or link-local IPv6
addresses on different L2 interfaces are the same node. This can only be
determined after examining the certificate after a successful security
association attempt.[¶](#section-6.6-10){.pilcrow}

The Decider [SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} suppress attempting a particular ACP
secure channel protocol connection on one L2 interface because this type
of ACP secure channel connection has failed to the peer with the same
ACP certificate on another L2 interface: not only may the supported ACP
secure channel protocol options be different on the same ACP peer across
different L2 interfaces, but also error conditions may cause
inconsistent failures across different L2 interfaces. Avoiding such
connection attempt optimizations can therefore help to increase
robustness in the case of errors.[¶](#section-6.6-11){.pilcrow}

Independent of the security association protocol chosen, candidate ACP
neighbors need to be authenticated based on their domain certificate.
This implies that any secure channel protocol [MUST]{.bcp14} support
certificate-based authentication that can support the ACP domain
membership check as defined in [Section 6.2.3](#certcheck){.xref}. If it
fails, the connection attempt is aborted and an error logged. Attempts
to reconnect [MUST]{.bcp14} be throttled. The [RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14}
default is exponential base-two backoff with an initial retransmission
time (IRT) of 10 seconds and a maximum retransmission time (MRT) of 640
seconds.[¶](#section-6.7-1){.pilcrow}

### [6.8.](#section-6.8){.section-number .selfRef} [Security Association (Secure Channel) Protocols](#name-security-association-secure){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-security-association-secure}

This section describes how ACP nodes establish secured data connections
to automatically discovered or configured peers in the ACP. [Section
6.4](#discovery-grasp){.xref} describes how peers that are adjacent on
an IPv6 subnet are discovered automatically. [Section
8.2](#remote-acp-neighbors){.xref} describes how to configure peers that
are not adjacent on an IPv6 subnet.[¶](#section-6.8-1){.pilcrow}

[Section 6.13.5.2](#ACP-virtual-interfaces){.xref} describes how secure
channels are mapped to virtual IPv6 subnet interfaces in the ACP. The
simple case is to map every ACP secure channel to a separate ACP
point-to-point virtual interface ([Section
6.13.5.2.1](#ACP-p2p-virtual-interfaces){.xref}). When a single subnet
has multiple ACP peers, this results in multiple ACP point-to-point
virtual interfaces across that underlying multiparty IPv6 subnet. This
can be optimized with ACP multi-access virtual interfaces ([Section
6.13.5.2.2](#ACP-ma-virtual-interfaces){.xref}), but the benefits of
that optimization may not justify the complexity of that
option.[¶](#section-6.8-2){.pilcrow}

#### [6.8.1.](#section-6.8.1){.section-number .selfRef} [General Considerations](#name-general-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-general-considerations}

Due to channel selection ([Section 6.6](#channel-selection){.xref}), ACP
can support an evolving set of security association protocols and does
not require support for a single network-wide MTI. ACP nodes only need
to implement those protocols required to interoperate with their
candidate peers, not with potentially any node in the ACP domain. See
[Section 6.8.5](#Profiles){.xref} for an example of
this.[¶](#section-6.8.1-1){.pilcrow}

The degree of security required on every hop of an ACP network needs to
be consistent across the network so that there is no designated
\"weakest link\" because it is that \"weakest link\" that would
otherwise become the designated point of attack. When the secure channel
protection on one link is compromised, it can be used to send and/or
receive packets across the whole ACP network. Therefore, even though the
security association protocols can be different, their minimum degree of
security should be comparable.[¶](#section-6.8.1-2){.pilcrow}

Secure channel protocols do not need to always support arbitrary Layer 3
(L3) connectivity between peers, but can leverage the fact that the
standard use case for ACP secure channels is an L2 adjacency. Hence, L2
dependent mechanisms could be adopted for use as secure channel
association protocols.[¶](#section-6.8.1-3){.pilcrow}

L2 mechanisms such as strong encrypted radio technologies or
\[[MACSEC](#MACSEC){.xref}\] may offer equivalent encryption, and the
ACP security association protocol may only be required to authenticate
ACP domain membership of a peer and/or derive a key for the L2
mechanism. Mechanisms that leverage such underlying L2 security to
auto-discover and associate ACP peers are possible and desirable to
avoid duplication of encryption, but none are specified in this
document.[¶](#section-6.8.1-4){.pilcrow}

Strong physical security of a link may stand in where cryptographic
security is infeasible. As there is no secure mechanism to automatically
discover strong physical security solely between two peers, it can only
be used with explicit configuration, and that configuration too could
become an attack vector. This document therefore specifies with [ACP
connect](#ACPconnect){.xref} ([Section 8.1](#ACPconnect){.xref}) only
one explicitly configured mechanism without any secure channel
association protocol for the case where both the link and the nodes
attached to it have strong physical
security.[¶](#section-6.8.1-5){.pilcrow}

The authentication of peers in any security association protocol
[MUST]{.bcp14} use the ACP certificate according to [Section
6.2.3](#certcheck){.xref}. Because auto-discovery of candidate ACP
neighbors via GRASP (see [Section 6.4](#discovery-grasp){.xref}) as
specified in this document does not communicate the neighbor\'s ACP
certificate, and ACP nodes may not (yet) have any other network
connectivity to retrieve certificates, any security association protocol
[MUST]{.bcp14} use a mechanism to communicate the certificate directly
instead of relying on a referential mechanism such as communicating only
a hash and/or URL for the certificate.[¶](#section-6.8.2-1){.pilcrow}

A security association protocol [MUST]{.bcp14} use Forward Secrecy
(whether inherently or as part of a profile of the security association
protocol).[¶](#section-6.8.2-2){.pilcrow}

Because the ACP payload of legacy protocol payloads inside the ACP and
hop-by-hop ACP flooded GRASP information is unencrypted, the ACP secure
channel protocol requires confidentiality. Symmetric encryption for the
transmission of secure channel data [MUST]{.bcp14} use encryption
schemes considered to be security wise equal to or better than 256-bit
key strength, such as AES-256. There [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be support for
NULL encryption.[¶](#section-6.8.2-3){.pilcrow}

Security association protocols typically only signal the end entity
certificate (e.g., the ACP certificate) and any possible intermediate CA
certificates for successful mutual authentication. The TA has to be
mutually known and trusted, and therefore its certificate does not need
to be signaled for successful mutual authentication. Nevertheless, for
use with ACP secure channel setup, there [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be the option
to include the TA certificate in the signaling to aid troubleshooting,
see [Section
9.1.1](#ta-troubleshoot){.xref}.[¶](#section-6.8.2-4){.pilcrow}

Signaling of TA certificates may not be appropriate when the deployment
relies on a security model where the TA certificate content is
considered confidential, and only its hash is appropriate for signaling.
ACP nodes [SHOULD]{.bcp14} have a mechanism to select whether the TA
certificate is signaled or not, assuming that both options are possible
with a specific secure channel protocol.[¶](#section-6.8.2-5){.pilcrow}

An ACP secure channel [MUST]{.bcp14} immediately be terminated when the
lifetime of any certificate in the chain used to authenticate the
neighbor expires or becomes revoked. This may not be standard behavior
in secure channel protocols because the certificate authentication may
only influence the setup of the secure channel in these protocols, but
may not be revalidated during the lifetime of the secure connection in
the absence of this requirement.[¶](#section-6.8.2-6){.pilcrow}

When specifying an additional security association protocol for ACP
secure channels beyond those covered in this document, any protocol
options that are unnecessary for the support of devices that are
expected to be able to support the ACP [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be eliminated in
order to minimize implementation complexity. For example, definitions
for security protocols often include old and/or inferior security
options required only to interoperate with existing devices that cannot
update to the currently preferred security options. Such old and/or
inferior security options do not need to be supported when a security
association protocol is first specified for the ACP, thus strengthening
the \"weakest link\" and simplifying ACP implementation
overhead.[¶](#section-6.8.2-7){.pilcrow}

To signal the ACP certificate chain (including TA) as required by
[Section 6.8.2](#common-requirements){.xref}, the \"X.509 Certificate -
Signature\" payload in IKEv2 can be used. It is mandatory according to
\[[RFC7296](#RFC7296){.xref}\], [Section
3.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7296#section-3.6){.relref}.[¶](#section-6.8.3.1.2-4){.pilcrow}

ACP nodes [SHOULD]{.bcp14} set up IKEv2 to only use the ACP certificate
and TA when acting as an IKEv2 responder on the IPv6 link-local address
and port number indicated in the \"AN_ACP\" DULL GRASP announcements
(see [Section
6.4](#discovery-grasp){.xref}).[¶](#section-6.8.3.1.2-5){.pilcrow}

When CERTREQ is received from a peer, and it does not indicate any of
this ACP node\'s TA certificates, the ACP node [SHOULD]{.bcp14} ignore
the CERTREQ and continue sending its certificate chain including its TA
as subject to the requirements and explanations in [Section
6.8.2](#common-requirements){.xref}. This will not result in successful
mutual authentication but assists
diagnostics.[¶](#section-6.8.3.1.2-6){.pilcrow}

Note that with IKEv2, failing authentication will only result in the
responder receiving the certificate chain from the initiator, but not
vice versa. Because ACP secure channel setup is symmetric (see [Section
6.7](#neighbor_verification){.xref}), every non-malicious ACP neighbor
will attempt to connect as an initiator, though, allowing it to obtain
the diagnostic information about the neighbor\'s
certificate.[¶](#section-6.8.3.1.2-7){.pilcrow}

In IKEv2, ACP nodes are identified by their ACP addresses. The
ID_IPv6_ADDR IKEv2 identification payload [MUST]{.bcp14} be used and
[MUST]{.bcp14} convey the ACP address. If the peer\'s ACP certificate
includes a 32HEXDIG ACP address in the acp-node-name (not \"0\" or
omitted), the address in the IKEv2 identification payload [MUST]{.bcp14}
match it. See [Section 6.2.3](#certcheck){.xref} for more information
about \"0\" or omitted ACP address fields in the
acp-node-name.[¶](#section-6.8.3.1.2-8){.pilcrow}

IKEv2 authentication [MUST]{.bcp14} use authentication method 14
(\"Digital Signature\") for ACP certificates; this authentication method
can be used with both RSA and ECDSA certificates, indicated by an ASN.1
object AlgorithmIdentifier.[¶](#section-6.8.3.1.2-9){.pilcrow}

The Digital Signature hash SHA2-512 [MUST]{.bcp14} be supported (in
addition to SHA2-256).[¶](#section-6.8.3.1.2-10){.pilcrow}

The IKEv2 Diffie-Hellman key exchange group 19 (256-bit random ECP),
[MUST]{.bcp14} be supported. Reason: ECC provides a similar security
level to finite-field (modular exponentiation (MODP)) key exchange with
a shorter key length, so is generally preferred absent other
considerations.[¶](#section-6.8.3.1.2-11){.pilcrow}

In network devices, it is often more common to implement
high-performance virtual interfaces on top of GRE encapsulation than on
top of a \"native\" IPsec association (without any other encapsulation
than those defined by IPsec). On those devices, it may be beneficial to
run the ACP secure channel on top of GRE protected by the IPsec
association.[¶](#section-6.8.3.2-1){.pilcrow}

The requirements for ESP/IPsec/IKEv2 with GRE are the same as for native
IPsec (see [Section 6.8.3.1](#IPsec){.xref}) except that IPsec transport
mode and next protocol GRE (47) are to be negotiated. Tunnel mode is not
required because of GRE. Traffic Selectors

#### [6.8.4.](#section-6.8.4){.section-number .selfRef} [ACP via DTLS](#name-acp-via-dtls){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-acp-via-dtls}

This document defines the use of ACP via DTLS on the assumption that it
is likely the first transport encryption supported in some classes of
constrained devices: DTLS is commonly used in constrained devices when
IPsec is not. Code space on those devices may be also be too limited to
support more than the minimum number of required
protocols.[¶](#section-6.8.4-1){.pilcrow}

An ACP node announces its ability to support DTLS version 1.2
(\"[Datagram Transport Layer Security Version 1.2](#RFC6347){.xref}\"
\[[RFC6347](#RFC6347){.xref}\]) compliant with the requirements defined
in this document as an ACP secure channel protocol in GRASP through the
\"DTLS\" \'objective-value\' in the \"AN_ACP\" objective (see [Section
6.4](#discovery-grasp){.xref}).[¶](#section-6.8.4-2){.pilcrow}

To run ACP via UDP and DTLS, a locally assigned UDP port is used that is
announced as a parameter in the GRASP \"AN_ACP\" objective to candidate
neighbors. This port can also be any newer version of DTLS as long as
that version can negotiate a DTLS 1.2 connection in the presence of a
peer that only supports DTLS 1.2.[¶](#section-6.8.4-3){.pilcrow}

All ACP nodes supporting DTLS as a secure channel protocol
[MUST]{.bcp14} adhere to the DTLS implementation recommendations and
security considerations of [BCP 195](#RFC7525){.xref}
\[[RFC7525](#RFC7525){.xref}\] except with respect to the DTLS version.
ACP nodes supporting DTLS [MUST]{.bcp14} support DTLS 1.2. They [MUST
NOT]{.bcp14} support older versions of
DTLS.[¶](#section-6.8.4-4){.pilcrow}

Unlike for IPsec, no attempts are made to simplify the requirements of
the recommendations in [BCP 195](#RFC7525){.xref}
\[[RFC7525](#RFC7525){.xref}\] because the expectation is that DTLS
would use software-only implementations where the ability to reuse
widely adopted implementations is more important than the ability to
minimize the complexity of a hardware-accelerated implementation, which
is known to be important for IPsec.[¶](#section-6.8.4-5){.pilcrow}

DTLS 1.3 \[[TLS-DTLS13](#I-D.ietf-tls-dtls13){.xref}\] is \"backward
compatible\" with DTLS 1.2 (see [Section
1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tls-dtls13-43#section-1){.relref}
of \[[TLS-DTLS13](#I-D.ietf-tls-dtls13){.xref}\]). A DTLS implementation
supporting both DTLS 1.2 and DTLS 1.3 does comply with the above
requirements of negotiating to DTLS 1.2 in the presence of a DTLS 1.2
only peer, but using DTLS 1.3 when booth peers support
it.[¶](#section-6.8.4-6){.pilcrow}

Version 1.2 is the MTI version of DTLS in this specification because of
the following:[¶](#section-6.8.4-7){.pilcrow}

-   [There is more experience with DTLS 1.2 across the spectrum of
    target ACP
    nodes.[¶](#section-6.8.4-8.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.8.4-8.1}
-   [Firmware of lower-end, embedded ACP nodes may not support a newer
    version for a long
    time.[¶](#section-6.8.4-8.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.8.4-8.2}
-   [There are significant changes with DTLS 1.3, such as a different
    record layer requiring time to gain implementation and deployment
    experience especially on lower-end devices with limited code
    space.[¶](#section-6.8.4-8.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.8.4-8.3}
-   [The existing BCP \[[RFC7525](#RFC7525){.xref}\] for DTLS 1.2 may
    take an equally longer time to be updated with experience from a
    newer DTLS
    version.[¶](#section-6.8.4-8.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.8.4-8.4}
-   [There are no significant benefits of DTLS 1.3 over DTLS 1.2 that
    are use-case relevant in the context of the ACP options for DTLS.
    For example, signaling performance improvements for session setup in
    DTLS 1.3 is not important for the ACP given the long-lived nature of
    ACP secure channel connections and the fact that DTLS connections
    are mostly link local (short
    RTT).[¶](#section-6.8.4-8.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.8.4-8.5}

Nevertheless, newer versions of DTLS, such as DTLS 1.3, have stricter
security requirements, and the use of the latest standard protocol
version is in general recommended for IETF security standards.
Therefore, ACP implementations are advised to support all the newer
versions of DTLS that can still negotiate down to DTLS
1.2.[¶](#section-6.8.4-9){.pilcrow}

There is no additional session setup or other security association
besides this simple DTLS setup. As soon as the DTLS session is
functional, the ACP peers will exchange ACP IPv6 packets as the payload
of the DTLS transport connection. Any DTLS-defined security association
mechanisms such as rekeying are used as they would be for any transport
application relying solely on DTLS.[¶](#section-6.8.4-10){.pilcrow}

#### [6.8.5.](#section-6.8.5){.section-number .selfRef} [ACP Secure Channel Profiles](#name-acp-secure-channel-profiles){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-acp-secure-channel-profiles}

As explained in the beginning of [Section
6.6](#channel-selection){.xref}, there is no single secure channel
mechanism mandated for all ACP nodes. Instead, this section defines two
ACP profiles, \"baseline\" and \"constrained\", for ACP nodes that do
introduce such requirements.[¶](#section-6.8.5-1){.pilcrow}

An ACP node supporting the baseline profile [MUST]{.bcp14} support IPsec
natively and [MAY]{.bcp14} support IPsec via GRE. An ACP node supporting
the constrained profile that cannot support IPsec [MUST]{.bcp14} support
DTLS. An ACP node connecting an area of constrained ACP nodes with an
area of baseline ACP nodes needs to support both IPsec and DTLS and
therefore supports both the baseline and constrained
profiles.[¶](#section-6.8.5-2){.pilcrow}

Explanation: not all types of ACP nodes are able to or need to connect
directly to each other, nor are they able to support or prefer all
possible secure channel mechanisms. For example, IoT devices with
limited code space may only support DTLS because that code already
exists on them for end-to-end security, but high-end core routers may
not want to support DTLS because they can perform IPsec in accelerated
hardware, but they would need to support DTLS in an underpowered CPU
forwarding path shared with critical control plane operations. This is
not a deployment issue for a single ACP across these types of nodes as
long as there are also appropriate gateway ACP nodes that sufficiently
support many secure channel mechanisms to allow interconnecting areas of
ACP nodes with a more constrained set of secure channel protocols. On
the edge between IoT areas and high-end core networks, general-purpose
routers that act as those gateways and that can support a variety of
secure channel protocols are the norm
already.[¶](#section-6.8.5-3){.pilcrow}

Native IPsec with tunnel mode provides the shortest encapsulation
overhead. GRE may be preferred by legacy implementations because, in the
past, the virtual interfaces required by ACP design in conjunction with
secure channels have been implemented more often for GRE than purely for
native IPsec.[¶](#section-6.8.5-4){.pilcrow}

ACP nodes need to specify the set of secure ACP mechanisms they support
in documentation and should declare which profile they support according
to the above requirements.[¶](#section-6.8.5-5){.pilcrow}

The ACP [MUST]{.bcp14} run an instance of GRASP inside of it. It is a
key part of the ACP services. The function in GRASP that makes it
fundamental as a service of the ACP is the ability to provide ACP-wide
service discovery (using objectives in
GRASP).[¶](#section-6.9.1-1){.pilcrow}

ACP provides IP unicast routing via RPL (see [Section
6.12](#routing){.xref}).[¶](#section-6.9.1-2){.pilcrow}

The ACP does not use IP multicast routing nor does it provide generic IP
multicast services (the handling of GRASP link-local multicast messages
is explained in [Section 6.9.2](#GRASP-substrate){.xref}). Instead, the
ACP provides service discovery via the objective discovery/announcement
and negotiation mechanisms of the ACP GRASP instance (services are a
form of objectives). These mechanisms use hop-by-hop reliable flooding
of GRASP messages for both service discovery (GRASP M_DISCOVERY
messages) and service announcement (GRASP M_FLOOD
messages).[¶](#section-6.9.1-3){.pilcrow}

choice of the ACP.[¶](#section-6.9.1-4){.pilcrow}

In the terminology of GRASP \[[RFC8990](#RFC8990){.xref}\], the ACP is
the security and transport substrate for the GRASP instance run inside
the ACP (\"ACP GRASP\").[¶](#section-6.9.2-1){.pilcrow}

This means that the ACP is responsible for ensuring that this instance
of GRASP is only sending messages across the ACP GRASP virtual
interfaces. Whenever the ACP adds or deletes such an interface because
of new ACP secure channels or loss thereof, the ACP needs to indicate
this to the ACP instance of GRASP. The ACP exists also in the absence of
any active ACP neighbors. It is created when the node has a domain
certificate, and it continues to exist even if all of its neighbors
cease operation.[¶](#section-6.9.2-2){.pilcrow}

In this case, ASAs using GRASP running on the same node still need to be
able to discover each other\'s objectives. When the ACP does not exist,
ASAs leveraging the ACP instance of GRASP via APIs [MUST]{.bcp14} still
be able to operate, and they [MUST]{.bcp14} be able to understand that
there is no ACP and that therefore the ACP instance of GRASP cannot
operate.[¶](#section-6.9.2-3){.pilcrow}

How the ACP acts as the security and transport substrate for GRASP is
shown in [Figure
8](#acp-grasp-picture){.xref}.[¶](#section-6.9.2-4){.pilcrow}

GRASP unicast messages inside the ACP always use the ACP address.
Link-local addresses from the ACP VRF [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be used inside
objectives. GRASP unicast messages inside the ACP are transported via
TLS. See [Section 6.1](#tls){.xref} for TLS requirements. TLS mutual
authentication [MUST]{.bcp14} use the ACP domain membership check
defined in [Section
6.2.3](#certcheck){.xref}.[¶](#section-6.9.2-5){.pilcrow}

GRASP link-local multicast messages are targeted for a specific ACP
virtual interface (as defined [Section 6.13.5](#ACP_interfaces){.xref}),
but they are sent by the ACP to an ACP GRASP virtual interface that is
constructed from the TCP connection(s) to the IPv6 link-local neighbor
address(es) on the underlying ACP virtual interface. If the ACP GRASP
virtual interface has two or more neighbors, the GRASP link-local
multicast messages are replicated to all neighbor TCP
connections.[¶](#section-6.9.2-6){.pilcrow}

TCP and TLS connections for GRASP in the ACP use the IANA-assigned TCP
port for GRASP (7017). Effectively, the transport stack is expected to
be TLS for connections to and from the ACP address (e.g., global-scope
address(es)) and TCP for connections to and from the link-local
addresses on the ACP virtual interfaces. The latter ones are only used
for the flooding of GRASP messages.[¶](#section-6.9.2-7){.pilcrow}

##### [6.9.2.1.](#section-6.9.2.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Discussion](#name-discussion){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-discussion}

TCP encapsulation for GRASP M_DISCOVERY and M_FLOOD link-local messages
is used because these messages are flooded across potentially many hops
to all ACP nodes, and a single link with even temporary packet-loss
issues (e.g., a Wi-Fi or Powerline link) can reduce the probability for
loss-free transmission so much that applications would want to increase
the frequency with which they send these messages. Such shorter periodic
retransmission of datagrams would result in more traffic and processing
overhead in the ACP than the hop-by-hop, reliable retransmission
mechanism offered by TCP and duplicate elimination by
GRASP.[¶](#section-6.9.2.1-1){.pilcrow}

TLS is mandated for GRASP non-link-local unicast because the ACP secure
channel mandatory authentication and encryption protects only against
attacks from the outside but not against attacks from the inside:
compromised ACP members that have (not yet) been detected and removed
(e.g., via domain certificate revocation and/or
expiry).[¶](#section-6.9.2.1-2){.pilcrow}

If GRASP peer connections were to use just TCP, compromised ACP members
could simply eavesdrop passively on GRASP peer connections for which
they are on-path (\"man in the middle\" or MITM) or intercept and modify
messages. With TLS, it is not possible to completely eliminate problems
with compromised ACP members, but attacks are a lot more
complex.[¶](#section-6.9.2.1-3){.pilcrow}

Eavesdropping and/or spoofing by a compromised ACP node is still
possible because in the model of the ACP and GRASP, the provider and
consumer of an objective have initially no unique information (such as
an identity) about the other side that would allow them to distinguish a
benevolent from a compromised peer. The compromised ACP node would
simply announce the objective as well, potentially filter the original
objective in GRASP when it is a MITM and act as an application-level
proxy. This of course requires that the compromised ACP node understand
the semantics of the GRASP negotiation to an extent that allows the
compromised node to proxy the messages without being detected, but in an
ACP environment, this is quite likely public knowledge or even

The GRASP TLS connections are run the same as any other ACP traffic
through the ACP secure channels. This leads to double authentication and
encryption, which has the following

The ACP is in a separate context from the normal data plane of the node.
This context includes the ACP channels\' IPv6 forwarding and routing as
well as any required higher-layer ACP
functions.[¶](#section-6.10-1){.pilcrow}

In a classical network system, a dedicated VRF is one logical
implementation option for the ACP. If allowed by the system\'s software
architecture, separation options that minimize shared components, such
as a logical container or virtual machine instance, are preferred. The
context for the ACP needs to be established automatically during the
bootstrap of a node. As much as possible, it should be protected from
being modified unintentionally by (data plane)
configuration.[¶](#section-6.10-2){.pilcrow}

Context separation improves security because the ACP is not reachable
from the data plane routing or forwarding table(s). Also, configuration
errors from the data plane setup do not affect the
ACP.[¶](#section-6.10-3){.pilcrow}

The channels explained above typically only establish communication
between two adjacent nodes. In order for communication to happen across
multiple hops, the Autonomic Control Plane requires ACP network-wide
valid addresses and routing. Each ACP node creates a loopback interface
with an ACP network-wide unique address (prefix) inside the ACP context
(as explained in [Section 6.10](#separation){.xref}). This address may
be used also in other virtual contexts.[¶](#section-6.11-1){.pilcrow}

With the algorithm introduced here, all ACP nodes in the same routing
subdomain have the same /48 ULA prefix. Conversely, ULA Global IDs from
different domains are unlikely to clash, such that two ACP networks can
be merged, as long as the policy allows that merge. See also [Section
10.1](#self-healing){.xref} for a discussion on merging
domains.[¶](#section-6.11-2){.pilcrow}

Links inside the ACP only use link-local IPv6 addressing, such that each
node\'s ACP only requires one routable address
prefix.[¶](#section-6.11-3){.pilcrow}

    administrative domain. For ACP traffic, the nodes are assumed to be
    either candidate hosts or transit nodes. There are no transit nodes
    with fewer privileges to know the identity of other hosts in the
    ACP. Therefore, ACP addresses do not need to be pseudorandom as
    discussed in \"[Security and Privacy Considerations for IPv6 Address

:   The 40-bit ULA Global ID (a term from
    \[[RFC4193](#RFC4193){.xref}\]) for ACP addresses carried in the
    acp-node-name in the ACP certificates are the first 40 bits of the
    SHA-256 hash of the routing-subdomain from the same acp-node-name.
    In the example of [Section 6.2.2](#domcert-acpinfo){.xref}, the
    routing-subdomain is \"area51.research.acp.example.com\", and the
    40-bit ULA Global ID is
    89b714f3db.[¶](#section-6.11.2-4.4.1){.pilcrow}

    When creating a new routing-subdomain for an existing Autonomic
    Network, it [MUST]{.bcp14} be ensured that rsub is selected so the
    resulting hash of the routing-subdomain does not collide with the
    hash of any preexisting routing-subdomains of the Autonomic Network.
    This ensures that ACP addresses created by registrars for different
    routing subdomains do not collide with each
    other.[¶](#section-6.11.2-4.4.2){.pilcrow}

    To allow for extensibility, the fact that the ULA Global ID is a
    hash of the routing-subdomain [SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} be assumed by any
    ACP node during normal operations. The hash function is only
    executed during the creation of the certificate. If BRSKI is used,
    then the BRSKI registrar will create the acp-node-name in response
    to the EST Certificate Signing Request (CSR) Attributes Request
    message sent by the pledge.[¶](#section-6.11.2-4.4.3){.pilcrow}

    Establishing connectivity between different ACPs (different
    acp-domain-names) is outside the scope of this specification. If it
    is being done through future extensions, then the rsub of all
    routing-subdomains across those Autonomic Networks needs to be
    selected so that the resulting routing-subdomain hashes do not
    collide. For example, a large cooperation with its own private TA
    may want to create different Autonomic Networks that initially do
    not connect but where the option to do so should be kept open. When
    taking this possibility into account, it is always easy to select
    rsub so that no collisions
    happen.[¶](#section-6.11.2-4.4.4){.pilcrow}

In the Zone Addressing Sub-Scheme, the ACP address in the certificate
has V field as all zero bits.[¶](#section-6.11.3-5){.pilcrow}

The ACP address set of the node includes addresses with any Zone-ID
value and any V value. Therefore, no two nodes in the same ACP and the
same hash(routing-subdomain) can have the same Node-ID with the Zone
Addressing Sub-Scheme, for example, by differing only in their
Zone-ID.[¶](#section-6.11.3-6){.pilcrow}

The Virtualization bit in this sub-scheme allows the easy addition of
the ACP as a component to existing systems without causing problems in
the port number space between the services in the ACP and the existing
system. V=0 is the ACP router (autonomic node base system), V=1 is the
host with preexisting transport endpoints on it that could collide with
the transport endpoints used by the ACP router. The ACP host could, for
example, have a P2P (peer-to-peer) virtual interface with the V=0
address as its router to the ACP. Depending on the software design of
ASAs, which is outside the scope of this specification, they may use the
V=0 or V=1 address.[¶](#section-6.11.3-7){.pilcrow}

The location of the V bit(s) at the end of the address allows the
announcement of a single prefix for each ACP node. For example, in a
network with 20,000 ACP nodes, this avoids 20,000 additional routes in
the routing table.[¶](#section-6.11.3-8){.pilcrow}

It is [RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14} that only Zone-ID 0 is used unless it is

or incremental adoption of the ACP as described in [Section
9.4](#incremental-adoption){.xref}.[¶](#section-6.11.3-9){.pilcrow}

zone_id defined in \"[IPv6 Scoped Address

\"Manual\" means that allocations of the Subnet-ID need to be done with

have one more bit available.[¶](#section-6.11.4-7){.pilcrow}

The Manual Addressing Sub-Scheme addresses [SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} be used
in ACP certificates. Any node capable of building ACP secure channels
and is permitted by registrar policy to participate in building ACP
secure channels [SHOULD]{.bcp14} receive an ACP address (prefix) from
one of the other ACP addressing sub-schemes. A node that cannot or is
not permitted to participate in ACP secure channels can connect to the
ACP via ACP connect interfaces of ACP edge nodes (see [Section
8.1](#ACPconnect){.xref}) without setting up an ACP secure channel. Its
ACP certificate [MUST]{.bcp14} omit the acp-address field to indicate
that its ACP certificate is only usable for non-ACP secure channel
authentication, such as end-to-end transport connections across the ACP

Address management of ACP connect subnets is done using traditional

This addressing sub-scheme foregoes the Zone-ID field ([Section
6.11.3](#zone-scheme){.xref}) to allow for larger, flatter routed
networks (e.g., as in IoT) with 8,421,376 Node-Numbers (2^23^ + 2^15^).
It also allows for up to 2^16^ (i.e., 65,536) different virtualized
addresses within a node, which could be used to address individual
software components in an ACP node.[¶](#section-6.11.5-3){.pilcrow}

The fields are the same as in the Zone Addressing Sub-Scheme ([Section
6.11.3](#zone-scheme){.xref}) with the following
refinements:[¶](#section-6.11.5-4){.pilcrow}

F:
:   Format bit. This bit determines the format of the subsequent
    bits.[¶](#section-6.11.5-5.2){.pilcrow}
:   

V:
:   Virtualization bit: this is a field that is either 8 or 16 bits. For
    F=0, it is 8 bits, for F=1 it is 16 bits. The V-bits are assigned by
    the ACP node. In the ACP certificate\'s ACP address ([Section
    6.2.2](#domcert-acpinfo){.xref}), the V-bits are always set to
    0.[¶](#section-6.11.5-5.4){.pilcrow}

Registrar-ID:
:   To maximize Node-Number and V, the Registrar-ID is reduced to 46
    bits. One or more domain-wide unique identifiers of the ACP
    registrar can be used for this purpose. See [Section
    6.11.7.2](#registrars-unique){.xref}.[¶](#section-6.11.5-5.6){.pilcrow}
:   

Node-Number:
:   The Node-Number is unique to each ACP node. There are two formats
    for the Node-Number. When F=0, the Node-Number is 23 bits, for F=1,
    it is 15 bits. Each format of Node-Number is considered to be in a
    unique number space.[¶](#section-6.11.5-5.8){.pilcrow}

The F=0 bit format addresses are intended to be used for \"general
purpose\" ACP nodes that would potentially have a limited number (less
than 256) of clients (ASA and/or autonomic functions or legacy services)
of the ACP that require separate V(irtual)
addresses.[¶](#section-6.11.5-6){.pilcrow}

The F=1 bit Node-Numbers are intended for ACP nodes that are ACP edge
nodes (see [Section 8.1.1](#NMS){.xref}) or that have a large number of
clients requiring separate V(irtual) addresses, for example, large SDN
controllers with container modular software architecture (see [Section
8.1.2](#software){.xref}).[¶](#section-6.11.5-7){.pilcrow}

Before further addressing sub-schemes are defined, experience with the
schemes defined here should be collected. The schemes defined in this
document have been devised to allow hopefully a sufficiently flexible
setup of ACPs for a variety of situations. These reasons also lead to
the fairly liberal use of address space: the Zone Addressing Sub-Scheme
is intended to enable optimized routing in large networks by reserving
bits for Zone-IDs. The Vlong Addressing Sub-Scheme enables the
allocation of 8/16-bit of addresses inside individual ACP nodes. Both
address spaces allow distributed, uncoordinated allocation of node
addresses by reserving bits for the Registrar-ID field in the

ACP registrars are responsible for enrolling candidate ACP nodes with
ACP certificates and associated trust anchor(s). They are also
responsible for including an acp-node-name field in the ACP certificate.
This field carries the ACP domain name and the ACP node\'s ACP address
prefix. This address prefix is intended to persist unchanged through the
lifetime of the ACP node.[¶](#section-6.11.7-1){.pilcrow}

Because of the ACP addressing sub-schemes, an ACP domain can have
multiple distributed ACP registrars that do not need to coordinate for
address assignment. ACP registrars can also be sub-CAs, in which case
they can also assign ACP certificates without dependencies against a
(shared) TA (except during renewals of their own
certificates).[¶](#section-6.11.7-2){.pilcrow}

ACP registrars are PKI registration authorities (RA) enhanced with the
handling of the ACP certificate-specific fields. They request
certificates for ACP nodes from a CA through any appropriate mechanism
(out of scope in this document, but this mechanism is required to be
BRSKI for ANI registrars). Only nodes that are trusted to be compliant
with the registrar requirements described in this section can be given
the necessary credentials to perform this RA function, such as the
credential for the ACP registrar to connect to the CA as a
registrar.[¶](#section-6.11.7-3){.pilcrow}

Any protocols or mechanisms may be used by ACP registrars as long as the
resulting ACP certificate and TA certificate(s) can be used by other
domain members to perform the ACP domain membership check described in
[Section 6.2.3](#certcheck){.xref}, and the acp-node-name meets the ACP
addressing requirements described in the next three
sections.[¶](#section-6.11.7.1-1){.pilcrow}

An ACP registrar could be a person deciding whether to enroll a
candidate ACP node and then orchestrating the enrollment of the ACP
certificate and associated TA, using command line or web-based commands
on the candidate ACP node and TA to generate and sign the ACP
certificate and configure certificate and TA onto the
node.[¶](#section-6.11.7.1-2){.pilcrow}

The only currently defined protocol for ACP registrars is BRSKI
\[[RFC8995](#RFC8995){.xref}\]. When BRSKI is used, the ACP nodes are
called ANI nodes, and the ACP registrars are called BRSKI or ANI
registrars. The BRSKI specification does not define the handling of the
acp-node-name field because the rules do not depend on BRSKI but apply
equally to any protocols or mechanisms that an ACP registrar may
use.[¶](#section-6.11.7.1-3){.pilcrow}

ACP registrars [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} allocate ACP address prefixes to ACP
nodes via the acp-node-name that would collide with the ACP address
prefixes of other ACP nodes in the same ACP domain. This includes both
prefixes allocated by the same ACP registrar to different ACP nodes as
well as prefixes allocated by other ACP registrars for the same ACP
domain.[¶](#section-6.11.7.2-1){.pilcrow}

To support such unique address allocation, an ACP registrar
[MUST]{.bcp14} have one or more 46-bit identifiers, called the
Registrar-ID, that are unique across the ACP domain. Allocation of
Registrar-ID(s) to an ACP registrar can happen through OAM mechanisms in
conjunction with some database and/or allocation
orchestration.[¶](#section-6.11.7.2-2){.pilcrow}

ACP registrars running on physical devices with known globally unique
EUI-48 MAC address(es) (EUI stands for \"Extended Unique Identifier\")
can use the lower 46 bits of those address(es) as unique Registrar-IDs
without requiring any external signaling and/or configuration (the upper
two bits, V and U, are not uniquely assigned but are functional). This
approach is attractive for distributed, non-centrally administered,
lightweight ACP registrar implementations. There is no mechanism to
deduce from a MAC address itself whether it is actually uniquely
assigned. Implementations need to consult additional offline information
before making this assumption, for example, by knowing that a particular
physical product or Network Interface Controller (NIC) chip is
guaranteed to use globally unique assigned EUI-48 MAC
address(es).[¶](#section-6.11.7.2-3){.pilcrow}

When the candidate ACP device (called pledge in BRSKI) is to be enrolled
into an ACP domain, the ACP registrar needs to allocate a unique ACP
address to the node and ensure that the ACP certificate gets an
acp-node-name field ([Section 6.2.2](#domcert-acpinfo){.xref}) with the
appropriate information: ACP domain name, ACP address, and so on. If the
ACP registrar uses BRSKI, it signals the ACP acp-node-name field to the
pledge via EST CSR Attributes (see \[[RFC8995](#RFC8995){.xref}\],
[Section
5.9.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8995#section-5.9.2){.relref},

The ACP registrar selects for the candidate ACP node a unique address
prefix from an appropriate ACP addressing sub-scheme, either a Zone
Addressing Sub-Scheme prefix (see [Section
6.11.3](#zone-scheme){.xref}), or a Vlong Addressing Sub-Scheme prefix
(see [Section 6.11.5](#Vlong){.xref}). The assigned ACP address prefix
encoded in the acp-node-name field of the ACP certificate indicates to
the ACP node its ACP address information. The addressing sub-scheme
indicates the prefix length: /127 for the Zone Addressing Sub-Scheme,
/120 or /112 for the Vlong Addressing Sub-Scheme. The first address of
the prefix is the ACP address. All other addresses in the prefix are for
other uses by the ACP node as described in the Zone Addressing
Sub-Scheme and Vlong Addressing Sub-Scheme sections. The ACP address
prefix itself is then signaled by the ACP node into the ACP routing
protocol (see [Section 6.12](#routing){.xref}) to establish IPv6
reachability across the ACP.[¶](#section-6.11.7.3-1){.pilcrow}

The choice of addressing sub-scheme and prefix length in the Vlong
Addressing Sub-Scheme is subject to ACP registrar policy. It could be an
ACP domain-wide policy, or a per ACP node or per ACP node type policy.
For example, in BRSKI, the ACP registrar is aware of the IDevID
certificate of the candidate ACP node, which typically contains a
\"serialNumber\" attribute in the subject field distinguished name
encoding that often indicates the node\'s vendor and device type, and it
can be used to drive a policy for selecting an appropriate addressing
sub-scheme for the (class of) node(s).[¶](#section-6.11.7.3-2){.pilcrow}

ACP registrars [SHOULD]{.bcp14} default to allocating Zone Addressing
Sub-Scheme addresses with Zone-ID 0.[¶](#section-6.11.7.3-3){.pilcrow}

ACP registrars that are aware of the IDevID certificate of a candidate
ACP device [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be able to choose the Zone vs. Vlong
Addressing Sub-Scheme for ACP nodes based on the \"serialNumber\"
attribute \[[X.520](#X.520){.xref}\] in the subject field distinguished
name encoding of the IDevID certificate, for example, by the PID
(Product Identifier) part, which identifies the product type, or by the
complete \"serialNumber\". The PID, for example, could identify nodes
that allow for specialized ASA requiring multiple addresses or for
non-autonomic virtual machines (VMs) for services, and those nodes could
receive Vlong Addressing Sub-Scheme ACP
addresses.[¶](#section-6.11.7.3-4){.pilcrow}

In a simple allocation scheme, an ACP registrar remembers persistently
across reboots its currently used Registrar-ID and, for each addressing
scheme (Zone with Zone-ID 0, Vlong with /112, Vlong with /120), the next
Node-Number available for allocation, and it increases the next
Node-Number during successful enrollment of an ACP node. In this simple
allocation scheme, the ACP registrar would not recycle ACP address
prefixes from ACP nodes that are no longer
used.[¶](#section-6.11.7.3-5){.pilcrow}

If allocated addresses cannot be remembered by registrars, then it is
necessary either to use a new value for the Register-ID field in the ACP
addresses or to determine allocated ACP addresses by determining the
addresses of reachable ACP nodes, which is not necessarily the set of
all ACP nodes. Untracked ACP addresses can be reclaimed by revoking or
not renewing their certificates and instead handing out new certificates
with new addresses (for example, with a new Registrar-ID value). Note
that such strategies may require coordination amongst
registrars.[¶](#section-6.11.7.3-6){.pilcrow}

defines the data packet artifacts required or beneficial in the

better compatibility with accelerated hardware forwarding planes, which
most often do not support the Hop-by-Hop headers used for RPI, but also
to avoid the overhead of the RPI header on the wire and cost of adding

To avoid the need for RPI, the ACP RPL profile uses a simple
routing/forwarding table based on destination prefix. To achieve this,
the profile uses only one RPL instanceID. This single instanceID can
contain only one Destination-Oriented Directed Acyclic Graph (DODAG),
and the routing/forwarding table can therefore only calculate a single
class of service (\"best effort towards the primary NOC/root\") and
cannot create optimized routing paths to accomplish latency or energy
goals between any two nodes.[¶](#section-6.12.1.1.1-1){.pilcrow}

This choice is a compromise. Consider a network that has multiple NOCs
in different locations. Only one NOC will become the DODAG root. Traffic
to and from other NOCs has to be sent through the DODAG (shortest path
tree) rooted in the primary NOC. Depending on topology, this can be an
annoyance from a point of view of latency or minimizing network path
resources, but this is deemed to be acceptable given how ACP traffic is
\"only\" network management/control traffic. See [Appendix
A.9.4](#future-rpl){.xref} for more
details.[¶](#section-6.12.1.1.1-2){.pilcrow}

Using a single instanceID/DODAG does not introduce a single point of
failure, as the DODAG will reconfigure itself when it detects data plane
forwarding failures, including choosing a different root when the
primary one fails.[¶](#section-6.12.1.1.1-3){.pilcrow}

The benefit of this profile, especially compared to other IGPs, is that
it does not calculate routes for nodes reachable through the same
interface as the DODAG root. This RPL profile can therefore scale to a
much larger number of ACP nodes in the same amount of computation and
memory than other routing protocols, especially on nodes that are leafs
of the topology or those close to those
leafs.[¶](#section-6.12.1.1.1-4){.pilcrow}

In RPL profiles where RPI (see [Section
6.12.1.13](#rpl-Data-Plane){.xref}) is present, it is also used to
trigger reconvergence when misrouted, for example, looping packets,
which are recognized because of their RPI data. This helps to minimize
RPL signaling traffic, especially in networks without stable topology
and slow links.[¶](#section-6.12.1.1.2-1){.pilcrow}

The ACP RPL profile instead relies on quickly reconverging the DODAG by
recognizing link state change (down/up) and triggering reconvergence
signaling as described in [Section 6.12.1.7](#rpl-dodag-repair){.xref}.
Since links in the ACP are assumed to be mostly reliable (or have
link-layer protection against loss) and because there is no stretch
according to [Section 6.12.1.7](#rpl-dodag-repair){.xref}, loops caused
by loss of RPL signaling packets should be exceedingly
rare.[¶](#section-6.12.1.1.2-2){.pilcrow}

In addition, there are a variety of mechanisms possible in RPL to
further avoid temporary loops that are [RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14} to be used
for the ACP RPL profile: DODAG Information Objects (DIOs)
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} be sent two or three times to inform children when
losing the last parent. The technique in \[[RFC6550](#RFC6550){.xref}\],
[Section

secure channel protocol mechanisms such as IKEv2 dead peer detection.
This can function as a replacement for a Low-power and Lossy Network\'s

Every ACP node (RPL node) announces an IPv6 prefix covering the
addresses assigned to the ACP node via the AcpNodeName. The prefix
length depends on the addressing sub-scheme of the acp-address, /127 for
the Zone Addressing Sub-Scheme and /112 or /120 for the Vlong Addressing
Sub-Scheme. See [Section 6.11](#addressing){.xref} for more
details.[¶](#section-6.12.1.11-1){.pilcrow}

Every ACP node [MUST]{.bcp14} install a black hole route (also known as
a null route) if there are unused parts of the ACP address space
assigned to the ACP node via its AcpNodeName. This is superseded by
longer prefixes assigned to interfaces for the address space actually
used by the node. For example, when the node has an ACP-Vlong-8 address
space, it installs a /120 black hole route. If it then only uses the ACP
address (first address from the space), for example, it would assign
that address via a /128 address prefix to the ACP loopback interface
(see [Section 6.13.5.1](#ACP-loopback){.xref}). None of those longer
prefixes are announced into RPL.[¶](#section-6.12.1.11-2){.pilcrow}

Because RPL minimizes the size of the routing and forwarding table,
prefixes reachable through the same interface as the RPL root are not
known on every ACP node. Therefore, traffic to unknown destination
addresses can only be discovered at the RPL root. The RPL root
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} have attach-safe mechanisms to operationally discover
and log such packets.[¶](#section-6.12.1.14-1){.pilcrow}

As this requirement places additional constraints on the data plane
functionality of the RPL root, it does not apply to \"normal\" nodes
that are not configured to have special functionality (i.e., the
administrative parameter from [Section 6.12.1.12](#rpl-admin){.xref} has
value 0b001). If the ACP network is degraded to the point where there
are no nodes that could be configured as root, registrar, or ACP connect
nodes, it is possible that the RPL root (and thus the ACP as a whole)
would be unable to detect traffic to unknown destinations. However, in
the absence of nodes with administrative preference other than 0b001,
there is also unlikely to be a way to get diagnostic information out of
the ACP, so detection of traffic to unknown destinations would not be
actionable anyway.[¶](#section-6.12.1.14-2){.pilcrow}

Since channels are established between adjacent neighbors by default,
the resulting overlay network does hop-by-hop encryption. Each node

There are no performance requirements for ACP implementations defined in
this document because the performance requirements depend on the
intended use case. It is expected that a fully autonomic node with a
wide range of ASA can require high forwarding plane performance in the
ACP, for example, for telemetry. Implementations of ACP that solely
support traditional or SDN-style use cases can benefit from ACP at lower
performance, especially if the ACP is used only for critical operations,
e.g., when the data plane is not available. The design of the ACP as
specified in this document is intended to support a wide range of
performance options: it is intended to allow software-only
implementations at potentially low performance, but the design can also
support high-performance options. See \[[RFC8368](#RFC8368){.xref}\] for

In order to be independent of the data plane routing and addressing, the
ACP secure channels discovered via GRASP use IPv6 link-local addresses
between adjacent neighbors. Note: [Section
8.2](#remote-acp-neighbors){.xref} specifies extensions in which secure
channels are configured tunnels operating over the data plane, so those
secure channels cannot be independent of the data
plane.[¶](#section-6.13.2-1){.pilcrow}

To avoid impacting the operations of the IPv6 (link-local)
interface/address used for ACP channels when configuring the data plane,
appropriate implementation considerations are required. If the IPv6
interface/link-local address is shared with the data plane, it needs to
be impossible to unconfigure and/or disable it through configuration.
Instead of sharing the IPv6 interface/link-local address, a separate
(virtual) interface with a separate IPv6 link-local address can be used.
For example, the ACP interface could be run over a separate MAC address
of an underlying L2 (Ethernet) interface. For more details and options,
see [Appendix
A.9.2](#dp-dependency){.xref}.[¶](#section-6.13.2-2){.pilcrow}

Note that other (nonideal) implementation choices may introduce
additional, undesired dependencies against the data plane, for example,
shared code and configuration of the secure channel protocols (IPsec
and/or DTLS).[¶](#section-6.13.2-3){.pilcrow}

The MTU for ACP secure channels [MUST]{.bcp14} be derived locally from
the underlying link MTU minus the secure channel encapsulation
overhead.[¶](#section-6.13.3-1){.pilcrow}

ACP secure channel protocols do not need to perform MTU discovery
because they are built across L2 adjacencies: the MTUs on both sides
connecting to the L2 connection are assumed to be consistent. Extensions
to ACP where the ACP is, for example, tunneled need to consider how to
guarantee MTU consistency. This is an issue of tunnels, not an issue of
running the ACP across a tunnel. Transport stacks running across ACP can
perform normal PMTUD (Path MTU Discovery). Because the ACP is meant to
prioritize reliability over performance, they [MAY]{.bcp14} opt to only
expect IPv6 minimum MTU (1280 octets) to avoid running into PMTUD
implementation bugs or underlying link MTU mismatch
problems.[¶](#section-6.13.3-2){.pilcrow}

If two nodes are connected via several links, the ACP [SHOULD]{.bcp14}
be established across every link, but it is possible to establish the
ACP only on a subset of links. Having an ACP channel on every link has a
number of advantages, for example, it allows for a faster failover in
case of link failure, and it reflects the physical topology more
closely. Using a subset of links (for example, a single link), reduces
resource consumption on the node because state needs to be kept per ACP
channel. The negotiation scheme explained in [Section
6.6](#channel-selection){.xref} allows the Decider (the node with the
higher ACP address) to drop all but the desired ACP channels to the
Follower, and the Follower will not retry to build these secure channels
from its side unless the Decider appears with a previously unknown GRASP
announcement (e.g., on a different link or with a different address
announced in GRASP).[¶](#section-6.13.4-1){.pilcrow}

Conceptually, the ACP VRF has two types of interfaces: the \"ACP
loopback interface(s)\" to which the ACP ULA address(es) are assigned
and the \"ACP virtual interfaces\" that are mapped to the ACP secure
channels.[¶](#section-6.13.5-1){.pilcrow}

For autonomous operations of the ACP, as described in [Section
6](#self-creation){.xref} and [Section 7](#acp-l2-switches){.xref}, the
ACP node uses the first address from the N bit ACP prefix assigned to
the node. N = (128 - number of Vbits of the ACP address). This address
is assigned with an address prefix of N or larger to a loopback
interface.[¶](#section-6.13.5.1-1){.pilcrow}

Other addresses from the prefix can be used by the ACP of the node as
desired. The autonomous operations of the ACP do not require additional
global-scope IPv6 addresses, they are instead intended for ASA or
non-autonomous functions. Components of the ACP that are not fully
autonomic, such as ACP connect interfaces (see [Figure
14](#acp-connect){.xref}), may also introduce additional global-scope
IPv6 addresses on other types of interfaces to the
ACP.[¶](#section-6.13.5.1-2){.pilcrow}

The use of loopback interfaces for global-scope addresses is common
operational configuration practice on routers, for example, in Internal
BGP (IBGP) connections since BGP4 (see \"[A Border Gateway Protocol 4
(BGP-4)](#RFC1654){.xref}\" \[[RFC1654](#RFC1654){.xref}\]) or earlier.
The ACP adopts and automates this operational
practice.[¶](#section-6.13.5.1-3){.pilcrow}

A loopback interface for use with the ACP as described above is an
interface that behaves according to Section
[4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6724#section-4){.relref} of
[\"Default Address Selection for Internet Protocol Version 6
(IPv6)\"](#RFC6724){.xref} \[[RFC6724](#RFC6724){.xref}\], paragraph 2.
Packets sent by the host of the node from the loopback interface behave
as if they are looped back by the interface so that they look as if they
originated from the loopback interface, are then received by the node
and forwarded by it towards the
destination.[¶](#section-6.13.5.1-4){.pilcrow}

The term \"loopback only\" indicates this behavior, but not the actual
name of the interface type chosen in an actual implementation. A
loopback interface for use with the ACP can be a virtual and/or software
construct without any associated hardware, or it can be a hardware
interface operating in loopback mode.[¶](#section-6.13.5.1-5){.pilcrow}

A loopback interface used for the ACP [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} have
connectivity to other nodes.[¶](#section-6.13.5.1-6){.pilcrow}

The following list reviews the reasons for the choice of loopback
addresses for ACP addresses, which is based on the IPv6 address
architecture and common challenges:[¶](#section-6.13.5.1-7){.pilcrow}

1.  [IPv6 addresses are assigned to interfaces, not nodes. IPv6
    continues the IPv4 model that a subnet prefix is associated with one
    link, see Section

    IPv6 global-scope address in the same VRF to more than one
    interface.[¶](#section-6.13.5.1-8.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.13.5.1-8.2}
3.  [Global-scope addresses assigned to interfaces that connect to other
    nodes (external interfaces) may not be stable addresses for
    communications because any such interface could fail due to reasons
    external to the node. This could render the addresses assigned to
    that interface
    unusable.[¶](#section-6.13.5.1-8.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.13.5.1-8.3}
4.  [If failure of the subnet does not bring down the interface and make
    the addresses unusable, it could result in unreachability of the
    address because the shortest path to the node might go through one
    of the other nodes on the same subnet, which could equally consider
    the subnet to be operational even though it is
    not.[¶](#section-6.13.5.1-8.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.13.5.1-8.4}
5.  [Many OAM service implementations on routers cannot deal with more
    than one peer address, often because they already expect that a
    single loopback address can be used, especially to provide a stable
    address under failure of external interfaces or
    links.[¶](#section-6.13.5.1-8.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.13.5.1-8.5}

7.  [To completely autonomously assign global-scope addresses to subnets
    connecting to other nodes, it would be necessary for every node to
    have an amount of prefix address space on the order of the maximum
    number of subnets that the node could connect to, and then the node
    would have to negotiate with adjacent nodes across those subnets
    which address space to use for each
    subnet.[¶](#section-6.13.5.1-8.7){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.13.5.1-8.7}
8.  [Using global-scope addresses for subnets between nodes is
    unnecessary if those subnets only connect routers, such as ACP
    secure channels, because they can communicate to remote nodes via
    their global-scope loopback addresses. Using global-scope addresses
    for those external subnets is therefore wasteful for the address
    space and also unnecessarily increases the size of the routing and
    forwarding tables, which, especially for the ACP, is highly
    undesirable because it should attempt to minimize the per-node

plane, such as the IPv6 link-local address of the underlying physical
interface, which can be attacked by SLAAC, or parameters of the secure
channel encapsulation header that may not be protected by the secure
channel mechanism.[¶](#section-6.13.5.2.2-7){.pilcrow}

The link-layer address of an ACP virtual interface is the address used
for the underlying interface across which the secure tunnels are built,
typically Ethernet addresses. Because unicast IPv6 packets sent to an
ACP virtual interface are not sent to a link-layer destination address
but rather to an ACP secure channel, the link-layer address fields
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} be ignored on reception, and instead the ACP secure
channel from which the message was received should be
remembered.[¶](#section-6.13.5.2.2-8){.pilcrow}

Multi-access ACP virtual interfaces are preferable implementations when
the underlying interface is a (broadcast) multi-access subnet because
they reflect the presence of the underlying multi-access subnet to the
virtual interfaces of the ACP. This makes it, for example, simpler to
build services with topology awareness inside the ACP VRF in the same
way as they could have been built running natively on the multi-access
interfaces.[¶](#section-6.13.5.2.2-9){.pilcrow}

Consider also the impact of point-to-point vs. multi-access virtual
interfaces on the efficiency of flooding via link-local multicast
messages.[¶](#section-6.13.5.2.2-10){.pilcrow}

Assume a LAN with three ACP neighbors, Alice, Bob, and Carol. Alice\'s
ACP GRASP wants to send a link-local GRASP multicast message to Bob and
Carol. If Alice\'s ACP emulates the LAN as per-peer, point-to-point
virtual interfaces, one to Bob and one to Carol, Alice\'s ACP GRASP will
send two copies of multicast GRASP messages: one to Bob and one to
Carol. If Alice\'s ACP emulates a LAN via a multipoint virtual
interface, Alice\'s ACP GRASP will send one packet to that interface,
and the ACP multipoint virtual interface will replicate the packet to
each secure channel, one to Bob, one to Carol. The result is the same.
The difference happens when Bob and Carol receive their packets. If they
use ACP point-to-point virtual interfaces, their GRASP instance would
forward the packet from Alice to each other as part of the GRASP
flooding procedure. These packets are unnecessary and would be discarded
by GRASP on receipt as duplicates (by use of the GRASP Session ID). If
Bob and Carol\'s ACP emulated a multi-access virtual interface, then
this would not happen because GRASP\'s flooding procedure does not
replicate packets back to the interface from which they were
received.[¶](#section-6.13.5.2.2-11){.pilcrow}

Note that link-local GRASP multicast messages are not sent directly as
IPv6 link-local multicast UDP messages to ACP virtual interfaces, but
instead to ACP GRASP virtual interfaces that are layered on top of ACP
virtual interfaces to add TCP reliability to link-local multicast GRASP
messages. Nevertheless, these ACP GRASP virtual interfaces perform the
same replication of messages and therefore have the same impact on
flooding. See [Section 6.9.2](#GRASP-substrate){.xref} for more
details.[¶](#section-6.13.5.2.2-12){.pilcrow}

RPL does support operations and correct routing table construction
across non-broadcast multi-access (NBMA) subnets. This is common when
using many radio technologies. When such NBMA subnets are used, they
[MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be represented as ACP multi-access virtual interfaces
because the replication of IPv6 link-local multicast messages will not
reach all NBMA subnet neighbors. As a result, GRASP message flooding
would fail. Instead, each ACP secure channel across such an interface
[MUST]{.bcp14} be represented as an ACP point-to-point virtual
interface. See also [Appendix
A.9.4](#future-rpl){.xref}.[¶](#section-6.13.5.2.2-13){.pilcrow}

Care needs to be taken when creating multi-access ACP virtual interfaces
across ACP secure channels between ACP nodes in different domains or
routing subdomains. If, for example, future inter-domain ACP policies
are defined as \"peer-to-peer\" policies, it is easier to create ACP
point-to-point virtual interfaces for these inter-domain secure
channels.[¶](#section-6.13.5.2.2-14){.pilcrow}

[Figure 13](#figure-13){.selfRef}: [Topology with L2 ACP
Switches](#name-topology-with-l2-acp-switch){.selfRef}
:::

Consider a large L2 LAN with routers ANrtr1 through ANrtrN connected via
some topology of L2 switches. Examples include large enterprise campus
networks with an L2 core, IoT networks, or broadband aggregation
networks, which often have a multilevel L2-switched
topology.[¶](#section-7.1-2){.pilcrow}

If the discovery protocol used for the ACP operates at the subnet level,
every ACP router will see all other ACP routers on the LAN as neighbors,
and a full mesh of ACP channels will be built. If some or all of the AN
switches are autonomic with the same discovery protocol, then the full
mesh would include those switches as well.[¶](#section-7.1-3){.pilcrow}

A full mesh of ACP connections can create fundamental scale challenges.
The number of security associations of the secure channel protocols will
likely not scale arbitrarily, especially when they leverage
platform-accelerated encryption/decryption. Likewise, any other ACP
operations (such as routing) need to scale to the number of direct ACP
neighbors. An ACP router with just four physical interfaces might be
deployed into a LAN with hundreds of neighbors connected via switches.
Introducing such a new, unpredictable scaling factor requirement makes
it harder to support the ACP on arbitrary platforms and in arbitrary
deployments.[¶](#section-7.1-4){.pilcrow}

Predictable scaling requirements for ACP neighbors can most easily be
achieved if, in topologies such as these, ACP-capable L2 switches can
ensure that discovery messages terminate on them so that neighboring ACP
routers and switches will only find the physically connected ACP L2
switches as their candidate ACP neighbors. With such a discovery
mechanism in place, the ACP and its security associations will only need
to scale to the number of physical interfaces instead of a potentially
much larger number of \"LAN-connected\" neighbors, and the ACP topology
will follow directly the physical topology, something that can then also
be leveraged in management operations or by
ASAs.[¶](#section-7.1-5){.pilcrow}

In the example above, consider that ANswitch1 and ANswitchM are ACP
capable, and ANswitch2 is not ACP capable. The desired ACP topology is
that ANrtr1 and ANrtrM only have an ACP connection to ANswitch1, and
that ANswitch1, ANrtr2, and ANrtrN have a full mesh of ACP connections
amongst each other. ANswitch1 also has an ACP connection with ANswitchM,
and ANswitchM has ACP connections to anything else behind
it.[¶](#section-7.1-6){.pilcrow}

### [7.2.](#section-7.2){.section-number .selfRef} [How (per L2 Port DULL GRASP)](#name-how-per-l2-port-dull-grasp){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-how-per-l2-port-dull-grasp}

To support ACP on L2 switches or L2-switched ports of an L3 device, it
is necessary to make those L2 ports look like L3 interfaces for the ACP
implementation. This primarily involves the creation of a separate DULL
GRASP instance/domain on every such L2 port. Because GRASP has a
dedicated link-local IPv6 multicast address (ALL_GRASP_NEIGHBORS), it is
sufficient that all packets for this address are extracted at the port
level and passed to that DULL GRASP instance. Likewise, the IPv6
link-local multicast packets sent by that DULL GRASP instance need to be
sent only towards the L2 port for this DULL GRASP instance (instead of
being flooded across all ports of the VLAN to which the port
belongs).[¶](#section-7.2-1){.pilcrow}

When the ports/interfaces across which the ACP is expected to operate in
an ACP-aware L2 switch or L2/L3 switch/router are L2-bridged, packets
for the ALL_GRASP_NEIGHBORS multicast address [MUST]{.bcp14} never be
forwarded between these ports. If MLD snooping is used, it
[MUST]{.bcp14} be prohibited from bridging packets for the
ALL_GRASP_NEIGHBORS IPv6 multicast address.[¶](#section-7.2-2){.pilcrow}

On hybrid L2/L3 switches, multiple L2 ports are assigned to a single L3
VLAN interface. With the aforementioned changes for DULL GRASP, ACP can
simply operate on the L3 VLAN interfaces, so no further (hardware)
forwarding changes are required to make ACP operate on L2 ports. This is
possible because the ACP secure channel protocols only use link-local
IPv6 unicast packets, and these packets will be sent to the correct L2
port towards the peer by the VLAN logic of the
device.[¶](#section-7.2-3){.pilcrow}

This is sufficient when P2P ACP virtual interfaces are established to
every ACP peer. When it is desired to create multi-access ACP virtual
interfaces (see [Section
6.13.5.2.2](#ACP-ma-virtual-interfaces){.xref}), it is
[REQUIRED]{.bcp14} not to coalesce all the ACP secure channels on the
same L3 VLAN interface, but only all those on the same L2
port.[¶](#section-7.2-4){.pilcrow}

If VLAN tagging is used, then the logic described above only applies to
untagged GRASP packets. For the purpose of ACP neighbor discovery via
GRASP, no VLAN-tagged packets [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be sent or received. In a
hybrid L2/L3 switch, each VLAN would therefore only create ACP
adjacencies across those ports where the VLAN is carried
untagged.[¶](#section-7.2-5){.pilcrow}

As a result, the simple logic is that ACP secure channels would operate
over the same L3 interfaces that present a single, flat bridged network
across all routers, but because DULL GRASP is separated on a per-port
basis, no full mesh of ACP secure channels is created, but only per-port
ACP secure channels to per-port L2-adjacent ACP node
neighbors.[¶](#section-7.2-6){.pilcrow}

For example, in the above picture, ANswitch1 would run separate DULL
GRASP instances on its ports to ANrtr1, ANswitch2, and ANswitchI, even
though all three ports may be in the data plane in the same (V)LAN and
perform L2 switching between these ports, ANswitch1 would perform ACP L3
routing between them.[¶](#section-7.2-7){.pilcrow}

The description in the previous paragraph is specifically meant to
illustrate that, on hybrid L3/L2 devices that are common in enterprise,
IoT, and broadband aggregation, there is only the GRASP packet
extraction (by Ethernet address) and GRASP link-local multicast per
L2-port packet injection that has to consider L2 ports at the
hardware-forwarding level. The remaining operations are purely ACP
control plane and setup of secure channels across the L3 interface. This
hopefully makes support for per-L2 port ACP on those hybrid devices
easy.[¶](#section-7.2-8){.pilcrow}

In devices without such a mix of L2 port/interfaces and L3 interfaces
(to terminate any transport-layer connections), implementation details
will differ. Logically and most simply every L2 port is considered and
used as a separate L3 subnet for all ACP operations. The fact that the
ACP only requires IPv6 link-local unicast and multicast should make
support for it on any type of L2 devices as simple as
possible.[¶](#section-7.2-9){.pilcrow}

A generic issue with ACP in L2-switched networks is the interaction with
the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP). Without further L2 enhancements, the
ACP would run only across the active STP topology, and the ACP would be
interrupted and reconverge with STP changes. Ideally, ACP peering
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} be built also across ports that are blocked in STP so
that the ACP does not depend on STP and can continue to run unaffected
across STP topology changes, where reconvergence can be quite slow. The
above described simple implementation options are not sufficient to
achieve this.[¶](#section-7.2-10){.pilcrow}

The ACP can be used by management systems, such as controllers or NMS
hosts, to connect to devices (or other type of nodes) through it. For
this, an NMS host needs to have access to the ACP. The ACP is a
self-protecting overlay network, which allows access only to trusted,
autonomic systems by default. Therefore, a traditional, non-ACP NMS does
not have access to the ACP by default, such as any other external
node.[¶](#section-8.1.1-1){.pilcrow}

If the NMS host is not autonomic, i.e., it does not support autonomic
negotiation of the ACP, then it can be brought into the ACP by explicit
configuration. To support connections to adjacent non-ACP nodes, an ACP
node [SHOULD]{.bcp14} support \"ACP connect\" (sometimes also called
\"autonomic connect\").[¶](#section-8.1.1-2){.pilcrow}

\"ACP connect\" is an interface-level, configured workaround for
connection of trusted non-ACP nodes to the ACP. The ACP node on which
ACP connect is configured is called an \"ACP edge node\". With ACP
connect, the ACP is accessible from those non-ACP nodes (such as NOC
systems) on such an interface without those non-ACP nodes having to
support any ACP discovery or ACP channel setup. This is also called
\"native\" access to the ACP because, to those NOC systems, the
interface looks like a normal network interface without any ACP secure
channel that is encapsulating the
traffic.[¶](#section-8.1.1-3){.pilcrow}

ACP connect has security consequences: all systems and processes
connected via ACP connect have access to all ACP nodes on the entire
ACP, without further authentication. Thus, the ACP connect interface and
the NOC systems connected to it need to be physically controlled and/or
secured. For this reason, the mechanisms described here explicitly do
not include options to allow for a non-ACP router to be connected across
an ACP connect interface and addresses behind such a router routed
inside the ACP.[¶](#section-8.1.1-5){.pilcrow}

Physically controlled and/or secured means that attackers cannot gain
access to the physical device hosting the ACP edge node, the physical
interfaces and links providing the ACP connect link, nor the physical
devices hosting the NOC device. In a simple case, ACP edge node and NOC
device are colocated in an access-controlled room, such as a NOC, to
which attackers cannot gain physical
access.[¶](#section-8.1.1-6){.pilcrow}

An ACP connect interface provides exclusive access to only the ACP. This
is likely insufficient for many NMS hosts. Instead, they would require a
second \"data plane\" interface outside the ACP for connections between
the NMS host and administrators, or Internet-based services, or for
direct access to the data plane. The document [\"Using Autonomic Control
Plane for Stable Connectivity of Network OAM\"](#RFC8368){.xref}
\[[RFC8368](#RFC8368){.xref}\] explains in more detail how the ACP can
be integrated in a mixed NOC environment.[¶](#section-8.1.1-7){.pilcrow}

An ACP connect interface [SHOULD]{.bcp14} use an IPv6 address/prefix
from the Manual Addressing Sub-Scheme ([Section
6.11.4](#manual-scheme){.xref}), letting the operator configure, for
example, only the Subnet-ID and having the node automatically assign the
remaining part of the prefix/address. It [SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} use a
prefix that is also routed outside the ACP so that the addresses clearly
indicate whether it is used inside the ACP or
not.[¶](#section-8.1.1-8){.pilcrow}

The prefix of ACP connect subnets [MUST]{.bcp14} be distributed by the
ACP edge node into the ACP routing protocol, RPL. The NMS host
[MUST]{.bcp14} connect to prefixes in the ACP routing table via its ACP
connect interface. In the simple case where the ACP uses only one ULA
prefix, and all ACP connect subnets have prefixes covered by that ULA
prefix, NMS hosts can rely on \[[RFC6724](#RFC6724){.xref}\] to
determine longest match prefix routes towards its different interfaces,
ACP and data plane. With \[[RFC6724](#RFC6724){.xref}\], the NMS host
will select the ACP connect interface for all addresses in the ACP
because any ACP destination address is longest matched by the address on
the ACP connect interface. If the NMS host\'s ACP connect interface uses
another prefix, or if the ACP uses multiple ULA prefixes, then the NMS
host requires (static) routes towards the ACP interface for these
prefixes.[¶](#section-8.1.1-9){.pilcrow}

When an ACP edge node receives a packet from an ACP connect interface,
the ACP edge node [MUST]{.bcp14} only forward the packet to the ACP if
the packet has an IPv6 source address from that interface (this is
sometimes called Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF) filtering). This
filtering rule [MAY]{.bcp14} be changed through administrative measures.
The more any such administrative action enables reachability of non-ACP
nodes to the ACP, the more this may cause security
issues.[¶](#section-8.1.1-10){.pilcrow}

To limit the security impact of ACP connect, nodes supporting it
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} implement a security mechanism to allow configuration
and/or use of ACP connect interfaces only on nodes explicitly targeted
to be deployed with it (those in physically secure locations such as a
NOC). For example, the registrar could disable the ability to enable ACP
connect on devices during enrollment, and that property could only be
changed through reenrollment. See also [Appendix
A.9.5](#role-assignments){.xref}.[¶](#section-8.1.1-11){.pilcrow}

ACP edge nodes [SHOULD]{.bcp14} have a configurable option to prohibit
packets with RPI headers (see [Section
6.12.1.13](#rpl-Data-Plane){.xref}) across an ACP connect interface.
These headers are outside the scope of the RPL profile in this
specification but may be used in future extensions of this
specification.[¶](#section-8.1.1-12){.pilcrow}

#### [8.1.2.](#section-8.1.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Software Components](#name-software-components){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-software-components}

The previous section assumed that the ACP edge node and NOC devices are
separate physical devices and that the ACP connect interface is a
physical network connection. This section discusses the implication when
these components are instead software components running on a single
physical device.[¶](#section-8.1.2-1){.pilcrow}

The ACP connect mechanism can be used not only to connect physically
external systems (NMS hosts) to the ACP but also other applications,
containers, or virtual machines. In fact, one possible way to eliminate
the security issue of the external ACP connect interface is to colocate
an ACP edge node and an NMS host by making one a virtual machine or
container inside the other; therefore converting the unprotected
external ACP subnet into an internal virtual subnet in a single device.
This would ultimately result in a fully ACP-enabled NMS host with
minimum impact to the NMS host\'s software architecture. This approach
is not limited to NMS hosts but could equally be applied to devices
consisting of one or more VNF (virtual network functions): an internal
virtual subnet connecting out-of-band management interfaces of the VNFs
to an ACP edge router VNF.[¶](#section-8.1.2-2){.pilcrow}

The core requirement is that the software components need to have a
network stack that permits access to the ACP and optionally also to the
data plane. Like in the physical setup for NMS hosts, this can be
realized via two internal virtual subnets: one that connects to the ACP
(which could be a container or virtual machine by itself), and one (or
more) connecting to the data plane.[¶](#section-8.1.2-3){.pilcrow}

This \"internal\" use of the ACP connect approach should not be
considered to be a \"workaround\" because, in this case, it is possible
to build a correct security model: it is not necessary to rely on
unprovable, external physical security mechanisms as in the case of
external NMS hosts. Instead, the orchestration of the ACP, the virtual
subnets, and the software components can be done by trusted software
that could be considered to be part of the ANI (or even an extended
ACP). This software component is responsible for ensuring that only
trusted software components will get access to that virtual subnet and
that only even more trusted software components will get access to both
the ACP virtual subnet and the data plane (because those ACP users could
leak traffic between ACP and data plane). This trust could be
established, for example, through cryptographic means such as signed
software packages.[¶](#section-8.1.2-4){.pilcrow}

ACP edge nodes, NMS hosts, and software components that, as described in
the previous section, are meant to be composed via virtual interfaces
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} support SLAAC \[[RFC4862](#RFC4862){.xref}\] on the ACP
connect subnet and route autoconfiguration according to \"[Default
Router Preferences and More-Specific Routes](#RFC4191){.xref}\"
\[[RFC4191](#RFC4191){.xref}\].[¶](#section-8.1.3-1){.pilcrow}

The ACP edge node acts as the router towards the ACP on the ACP connect
subnet, providing the (auto)configured prefix for the ACP connect subnet
and (auto)configured routes to the ACP to NMS hosts and/or software
components.[¶](#section-8.1.3-2){.pilcrow}

The ACP edge node uses the Route Information Option (RIO) of
\[[RFC4191](#RFC4191){.xref}\] to announce aggregated prefixes for
address prefixes used in the ACP (with normal RIO lifetimes). In
addition, the ACP edge node also uses a RIO to announce the default
route (::/0) with a lifetime of 0.[¶](#section-8.1.3-3){.pilcrow}

These RIOs allow the connecting of type C hosts to the ACP via an ACP
connect subnet on one interface and another network (Data Plane and/or
NMS network) on the same or another interface of the type C host,
relying on routers other than the ACP edge node. The RIOs ensure that
these hosts will only route the prefixes used in the ACP to the ACP edge
node.[¶](#section-8.1.3-4){.pilcrow}

Type A and B hosts ignore the RIOs and will consider the ACP node to be
their default router for all destinations. This is sufficient when the
type A or type B host only needs to connect to the ACP but not to other
networks. Attaching a type A or type B host to both the ACP and other
networks requires explicit ACP prefix route configuration on either the
host or the combined ACP and data plane interface on the ACP edge node,
see [Section 8.1.4](#SingleIF){.xref}.[¶](#section-8.1.3-5){.pilcrow}

Aggregated prefix means that the ACP edge node needs to only announce
the /48 ULA prefixes used in the ACP but none of the actual /64 (Manual
Addressing Sub-Scheme), /127 (Zone Addressing Sub-Scheme), /112 or /120
(Vlong Addressing Sub-Scheme) routes of actual ACP nodes. If ACP
interfaces are configured with non-ULA prefixes, then those prefixes
cannot be aggregated without further configured policy on the ACP edge
node. This explains the above recommendation to use ACP ULA prefixes for
ACP connect interfaces: they allow for a shorter list of prefixes to be
signaled via \[[RFC4191](#RFC4191){.xref}\] to NMS hosts and software
components.[¶](#section-8.1.3-6){.pilcrow}

The ACP edge nodes that have a Vlong ACP address [MAY]{.bcp14} allocate
a subset of their /112 or /120 address prefix to ACP connect
interface(s) to eliminate the need to non-autonomically configure and/or
provision the address prefixes for such ACP connect
interfaces.[¶](#section-8.1.3-7){.pilcrow}

Using two physical and/or virtual subnets (and therefore interfaces) to
NMS hosts (as per [Section 8.1.1](#NMS){.xref}) or software (as per
[Section 8.1.2](#software){.xref}) may be seen as additional complexity,
for example, with legacy NMS hosts that support only one IP interface,
or it may be insufficient to support type A or type B hosts
\[[RFC4191](#RFC4191){.xref}\] (see [Section
8.1.3](#ACautoconfig){.xref}).[¶](#section-8.1.4-2){.pilcrow}

To provide a single subnet to both the ACP and Data plane, the ACP edge
node needs to demultiplex packets from NMS hosts into ACP VRF and data
plane. This is sometimes called \"VRF select\". If the ACP VRF has no
overlapping IPv6 addresses with the data plane (it should have no
overlapping addresses), then this function can use the IPv6 destination
address. The problem is source address selection on the NMS host(s)
according to
\[[RFC6724](#RFC6724){.xref}\].[¶](#section-8.1.4-3){.pilcrow}

Consider the simple case: the ACP uses only one ULA prefix, and the ACP
IPv6 prefix for the combined ACP and data plane interface is covered by
that ULA prefix. The ACP edge node announces both the ACP IPv6 prefix
and one (or more) prefixes for the data plane. Without further policy
configurations on the NMS host(s), it may select its ACP address as a
source address for data plane ULA destinations because of Rule 8
([Section 5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6724#section-5){.relref}
of \[[RFC6724](#RFC6724){.xref}\]). The ACP edge node can pass on the
packet to the data plane, but the ACP source address should not be used
for data plane traffic, and return traffic may
fail.[¶](#section-8.1.4-4){.pilcrow}

If the ACP carries multiple ULA prefixes or non-ULA ACP connect
prefixes, then the correct source address selection becomes even more
problematic.[¶](#section-8.1.4-5){.pilcrow}

With separate ACP connect and data plane subnets and prefix
announcements \[[RFC4191](#RFC4191){.xref}\] that are to be routed
across the ACP connect interface, the source address selection of Rule 5
(use address of outgoing interface) ([Section
5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6724#section-5){.relref} of
\[[RFC6724](#RFC6724){.xref}\]) will be used, so that above problems do
not occur, even in more complex cases of multiple ULA and non-ULA
prefixes in the ACP routing table.[¶](#section-8.1.4-6){.pilcrow}

To achieve the same behavior with a combined ACP and data plane
interface, the ACP edge node needs to behave as two separate routers on
the interface: one link-local IPv6 address/router for its ACP
reachability, and one link-local IPv6 address/router for its data plane
reachability. The Router Advertisements for both are as described in
[Section 8.1.3](#ACautoconfig){.xref}: for the ACP, the ACP prefix is
announced together with the prefix option \[[RFC4191](#RFC4191){.xref}\]
routed across the ACP, and the lifetime is set to zero to disqualify
this next hop as a default router. For the data plane, the data plane
prefix(es) are announced together with whatever default router
parameters are used for the data plane.[¶](#section-8.1.4-7){.pilcrow}

As a result, source address selection Rule 5.5 ([Section
5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6724#section-5){.relref} of
\[[RFC6724](#RFC6724){.xref}\]) may result in the same correct source
address selection behavior of NMS hosts without further configuration as
the separate ACP connect and data plane interfaces on the host. As
described in the text for Rule 5.5 ([Section
5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6724#section-5){.relref} of
\[[RFC6724](#RFC6724){.xref}\]), this is only a [MAY]{.bcp14} because
IPv6 hosts are not required to track next-hop information. If an NMS
host does not do this, then separate ACP connect and data plane
interfaces are the preferable method of attachment. Hosts implementing
\"[First-Hop Router Selection by Hosts in a Multi-Prefix
Network](#RFC8028){.xref}\" \[[RFC8028](#RFC8028){.xref}\] should
(instead of may) implement Rule 5.5 ([Section
5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6724#section-5){.relref} of
\[[RFC6724](#RFC6724){.xref}\]), so it is preferred for hosts to support
\[[RFC8028](#RFC8028){.xref}\].[¶](#section-8.1.4-8){.pilcrow}

ACP edge nodes [MAY]{.bcp14} support the combined ACP and data plane
interface.[¶](#section-8.1.4-9){.pilcrow}

#### [8.1.5.](#section-8.1.5){.section-number .selfRef} [Use of GRASP](#name-use-of-grasp){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-use-of-grasp}

GRASP can and should be possible to use across ACP connect interfaces,
especially in the architecturally correct solution when it is used as a
mechanism to connect software (e.g., ASA or legacy NMS applications) to
the ACP.[¶](#section-8.1.5-1){.pilcrow}

Given how the ACP is the security and transport substrate for GRASP, the
requirements are that those devices connected via ACP connect are
equivalently (if not better) secured against attacks than ACP nodes that
do not use ACP connect, and they run only software that is equally (if
not better) protected, known (or trusted) not to be malicious, and
accordingly designed to isolate access to the ACP against external
equipment.[¶](#section-8.1.5-2){.pilcrow}

The difference in security is that cryptographic security of the ACP
secure channel is replaced by required physical security and/or control
of the network connection between an ACP edge node and the NMS or other
host reachable via the ACP connect interface. See [Section
8.1.1](#NMS){.xref}.[¶](#section-8.1.5-3){.pilcrow}

When using the combined ACP and data plane interface, care has to be
taken that only GRASP messages received from software or NMS hosts and
intended for the ACP GRASP domain are forwarded by ACP edge nodes.
Currently there is no definition for a GRASP security and transport
substrate beside the ACP, so there is no definition how such
software/NMS host could participate in two separate GRASP domains across
the same subnet (ACP and data plane domains). Currently it is assumed
that all GRASP packets on a combined ACP and data plane interface belong
to the GRASP ACP domain. They [SHOULD]{.bcp14} all use the ACP IPv6
addresses of the software/NMS hosts. The link-local IPv6 addresses of
software/NMS hosts (used for GRASP M_DISCOVERY and M_FLOOD messages) are
also assumed to belong to the ACP address
space.[¶](#section-8.1.5-4){.pilcrow}

An IP-in-IP, GRE, or other form of preexisting tunnel is configured
between two remote ACP peers, and the virtual interfaces representing
the tunnel are configured for \"ACP enable\". This will enable IPv6
link-local addresses and DULL on this tunnel. As a result, the tunnel is
used for normal \"L2 adjacent\" candidate ACP neighbor discovery with
DULL and secure channel setup procedures described in this
document.[¶](#section-8.2.2-1){.pilcrow}

Tunneled Remote ACP Neighbor requires two encapsulations: the configured
tunnel and the secure channel inside of that tunnel. This makes it in
general less desirable than Configured Remote ACP Neighbor. Benefits of
tunnels are that it may be easier to implement because there is no
change to the ACP functionality - just running it over a virtual
(tunnel) interface instead of only native interfaces. The tunnel itself
may also provide PMTUD while the secure channel method may not. Or the
tunnel mechanism is permitted/possible through some firewall while the
secure channel method may not.[¶](#section-8.2.2-2){.pilcrow}

Tunneling using an insecure tunnel encapsulation increases, on average,
the risk of a MITM downgrade attack somewhere along the underlay path.
In such an attack, the MITM filters packets for all but the most easily
attacked ACP secure channel option to force use of that option. ACP
nodes supporting Tunneled Remote ACP Neighbors [SHOULD]{.bcp14} support
configuration on such tunnel interfaces to restrict or explicitly select
the available ACP secure channel protocols (if the ACP node supports
more than one ACP secure channel protocol in the first
place).[¶](#section-8.2.2-3){.pilcrow}

than L2 adjacent ACP neighbors based on link-local addressing, since

Nevertheless, these options may be crucial to incrementally deploying
the ACP, especially if it is meant to connect islands across the

Even though ACP and ANI in general are removing many manual
configuration mistakes through their automation, it is important to
provide good diagnostics for them.[¶](#section-9.1-1){.pilcrow}

Basic standardized diagnostics would require support for (YANG) models
representing the complete (auto)configuration and operational state of
all components: GRASP, ACP, and the infrastructure used by them, such as
TLS/DTLS, IPsec, certificates, TA, time, VRF, and so on. While
necessary, this is not sufficient.[¶](#section-9.1-2){.pilcrow}

Simply representing the state of components does not allow operators to
quickly take action \-- unless they understand how to interpret the
data, which can mean a requirement for deep understanding of all
components and how they interact in the
ACP/ANI.[¶](#section-9.1-3){.pilcrow}

Diagnostic supports should help to quickly answer the questions
operators are expected to ask, such as \"Is the ACP working correctly?\"
or \"Why is there no ACP connection to a known neighboring
node?\"[¶](#section-9.1-4){.pilcrow}

In current network management approaches, the logic to answer these
questions is most often built into centralized diagnostics software that
leverages the above mentioned data models. While this approach is
feasible for components utilizing the ANI, it is not sufficient to
diagnose the ANI itself:[¶](#section-9.1-5){.pilcrow}

-   [Developing the logic to identify common issues requires operational
    experience with the components of the ANI. Letting each management
    system define its own analysis is
    inefficient.[¶](#section-9.1-6.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-9.1-6.1}
-   [When the ANI is not operating correctly, it may not be possible to
    run diagnostics remotely because of missing connectivity. The ANI
    should therefore have diagnostic capabilities available locally on
    the nodes
    themselves.[¶](#section-9.1-6.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-9.1-6.2}
-   [Certain operations are difficult or impossible to monitor in real
    time, such as initial bootstrap issues in a network location where
    no capabilities exist to attach local diagnostics. Therefore, it is
    important to also define how to capture (log) diagnostics locally
    for later retrieval. Ideally, these captures are also nonvolatile so
    that they can survive extended power-off conditions, for example,
    when a device that fails to be brought up zero-touch is sent for
    diagnostics at a more appropriate
    location.[¶](#section-9.1-6.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-9.1-6.3}

The simplest form of diagnostics for answering questions such as the
above is to represent the relevant information sequentially in
dependency order, so that the first unexpected and/or nonoperational

These lists are not necessarily complete, but they illustrate the
principle and show that there are variety of issues ranging from normal
operational causes (a neighbor in another ACP domain) to problems in the
credentials management (certificate lifetimes), to explicit security
actions (revocation) or unexpected connectivity issues (intervening L2
equipment).[¶](#section-9.1-15){.pilcrow}

The items so far illustrate how the ANI operations can be diagnosed with
passive observation of the operational state of its components including
historic, cached, and/or counted events. This is not necessarily
sufficient to provide good enough diagnostics
overall.[¶](#section-9.1-16){.pilcrow}

The components of ACP and BRSKI are designed with security in mind, but
they do not attempt to provide diagnostics for building the network
itself. Consider two examples:[¶](#section-9.1-17){.pilcrow}

1.  [BRSKI does not allow for a neighboring device to identify the
    pledge\'s IDevID certificate. Only the selected BRSKI registrar can
    do this, but it may be difficult to disseminate information from
    those BRSKI registrars about undesired pledges to locations and/or
    nodes where information about those pledges is
    desired.[¶](#section-9.1-18.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-9.1-18.1}
2.  [LLDP disseminates information about nodes, such as node model,
    type, and/or software and interface name and/or number of the
    connection, to their immediate neighbors. This information is often
    helpful or even necessary in network diagnostics. It can equally be
    considered too insecure to make this information available
    unprotected to all possible
    neighbors.[¶](#section-9.1-18.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-9.1-18.2}

An \"interested adjacent party\" can always determine the IDevID
certificate of a BRSKI pledge by behaving like a BRSKI proxy/registrar.
Therefore, the IDevID certificate of a BRSKI pledge is not meant to be
protected \-- it just has to be queried and is not signaled unsolicited
(as it would be in LLDP) so that other observers on the same subnet can
determine who is an \"interested adjacent
party\".[¶](#section-9.1-19){.pilcrow}

#### [9.1.1.](#section-9.1.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Secure Channel Peer Diagnostics](#name-secure-channel-peer-diagnos){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-secure-channel-peer-diagnos}

When using mutual certificate authentication, the TA certificate is not
required to be signaled explicitly because its hash is sufficient for
certificate chain validation. In the case of ACP secure channel setup,
this leads to limited diagnostics when authentication fails because of
TA mismatch. For this reason, [Section
6.8.2](#common-requirements){.xref} recommends also including the TA
certificate in the secure channel signaling. This should be possible to
do without modifying the security association protocols used by the ACP.
For example, while \[[RFC7296](#RFC7296){.xref}\] does not mention this,
it also does not prohibit it.[¶](#section-9.1.1-1){.pilcrow}

One common use case where diagnostics through the signaled TA of a
candidate peer are very helpful is the multi-tenant environment, such as
an office building, where different tenants run their own networks and
ACPs. Each tenant is given supposedly disjoint L2 connectivity through
the building infrastructure. In these environments, there are various
common errors through which a device may receive L2 connectivity into
the wrong tenant\'s network.[¶](#section-9.1.1-2){.pilcrow}

While the ACP itself is not impacted by this, the data plane to be built
later may be impacted. Therefore, it is important to be able to diagnose
such undesirable connectivity from the ACP so that any autonomic or
non-autonomic mechanisms to configure the data plane can treat such
interfaces accordingly. The information in the TA of the peer can then
ease troubleshooting of such issues.[¶](#section-9.1.1-3){.pilcrow}

Another use case is the intended or accidental reactivation of
equipment, such as redundant gear taken from storage, whose TA
certificate has long expired.[¶](#section-9.1.1-4){.pilcrow}

A third use case is when, in a merger and acquisition case, ACP nodes
have not been correctly provisioned with the mutual TA of a previously
disjoint ACP. This assumes that the ACP domain names were already
aligned so that the ACP domain membership check is only failing on the
TA.[¶](#section-9.1.1-5){.pilcrow}

A fourth use case is when multiple registrars are set up for the same
ACP but are not correctly set up with the same TA. For example, when
registrars support also being CAs themselves but are misconfigured to
become TAs instead of intermediate CAs.[¶](#section-9.1.1-6){.pilcrow}

As described in [Section 6.11.7](#acp-registrars){.xref}, the ACP
addressing mechanism is designed to enable lightweight, distributed, and
uncoordinated ACP registrars that provide ACP address prefixes to
candidate ACP nodes by enrolling them with an ACP certificate into an
ACP domain via any appropriate mechanism and/or protocol, automated or
not.[¶](#section-9.2-1){.pilcrow}

This section summarizes and discusses the interactions with other
entities required by an ACP registrar.[¶](#section-9.2.1-1){.pilcrow}

In a simple instance of an ACP network, no central NOC component beside
a TA is required. Typically, this is a root CA. One or more
uncoordinated acting ACP registrars can be set up, performing the
following interactions.[¶](#section-9.2.1-2){.pilcrow}

To orchestrate enrolling a candidate ACP node autonomically, the ACP
registrar can rely on the ACP and use proxies to reach the candidate ACP
node, therefore allowing minimal, preexisting (auto)configured network
services on the candidate ACP node. BRSKI defines the BRSKI proxy, a
design that can be adopted for various protocols that pledges and/or
candidate ACP nodes could want to use, for example, BRSKI over CoAP
(Constrained Application Protocol) or the proxying of
NETCONF.[¶](#section-9.2.1-3){.pilcrow}

To reach a TA that has no ACP connectivity, the ACP registrar uses the
data plane. The ACP and data plane in an ACP registrar could (and by
default should) be completely isolated from each other at the network
level. Only applications such as the ACP registrar would need the
ability for their transport stacks to access
both.[¶](#section-9.2.1-4){.pilcrow}

In non-autonomic enrollment options, the data plane between an ACP
registrar and the candidate ACP node needs to be configured first. This
includes the ACP registrar and the candidate ACP node. Then any
appropriate set of protocols can be used between the ACP registrar and
the candidate ACP node to discover the other side, and then connect and
enroll (configure) the candidate ACP node with an ACP certificate. For
example, NETCONF Zero Touch (\"[Secure Zero Touch Provisioning
(SZTP)](#RFC8572){.xref}\" \[[RFC8572](#RFC8572){.xref}\]) is a protocol
that could be used for this. BRSKI using optional discovery mechanisms
is equally a possibility for candidate ACP nodes attempting to be
enrolled across non-ACP networks, such as the
Internet.[¶](#section-9.2.1-5){.pilcrow}

When a candidate ACP node, such as a BRSKI pledge, has secure bootstrap,
it will not trust being configured and/or enrolled across the network
unless it is presented with a voucher (see \"[A Voucher Artifact for
Bootstrapping Protocols](#RFC8366){.xref}\"
\[[RFC8366](#RFC8366){.xref}\]) authorizing the network to take
possession of the node. An ACP registrar will then need a method to
retrieve such a voucher, either offline or online from a MASA
(Manufacturer Authorized Signing Authority). BRSKI and NETCONF Zero
Touch are two protocols that include capabilities to present the voucher
to the candidate ACP node.[¶](#section-9.2.1-6){.pilcrow}

An ACP registrar could operate EST for ACP certificate renewal and/or
act as a CRL Distribution Point. A node performing these services does
not need to support performing (initial) enrollment, but it does require
the same above described connectivity as an ACP registrar: via the ACP
to the ACP nodes and via the data plane to the TA and other sources of
CRL information.[¶](#section-9.2.1-7){.pilcrow}

When an ACP node renews and/or rekeys its certificate, it may end up
doing so via a different registrar (e.g., EST server) than the one it
originally received its ACP certificate from, for example, because that
original ACP registrar is gone. The ACP registrar through which the
renewal/rekeying is performed would by default trust the acp-node-name
from the ACP node\'s current ACP certificate and maintain this
information so that the ACP node maintains its ACP address prefix. In
EST renewal/rekeying, the ACP node\'s current ACP certificate is
signaled during the TLS handshake.[¶](#section-9.2.3-1){.pilcrow}

This simple scenario has two limitations:[¶](#section-9.2.3-2){.pilcrow}

1.  [The ACP registrar cannot directly assign certificates to nodes and
    therefore needs an \"online\" connection to the
    TA.[¶](#section-9.2.3-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-9.2.3-3.1}
2.  [Recovery from a compromised ACP registrar is difficult. When an ACP

    through the ACP routing
    protocol.[¶](#section-9.2.3-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-9.2.3-3.2}

Even when such a malicious ACP registrar is detected, resolving the
problem may be difficult because it would require identifying all the
wrong ACP certificates assigned via the ACP registrar after it was
compromised. Without additional centralized tracking of assigned
certificates, there is no way to do this.[¶](#section-9.2.3-4){.pilcrow}

In situations where either of the above two limitations are an issue,
ACP registrars could also be sub-CAs. This removes the need for
connectivity to a TA whenever an ACP node is enrolled, and it reduces
the need for connectivity of such an ACP registrar to a TA to only those
times when it needs to renew its own certificate. The ACP registrar
would also now use its own (sub-CA) certificate to enroll and sign the
ACP node\'s certificates, and therefore it is only necessary to revoke a
compromised ACP registrar\'s sub-CA certificate. Alternatively, one can
let it expire and not renew it when the certificate of the sub-CA is
appropriately short-lived.[¶](#section-9.2.4-1){.pilcrow}

As the ACP domain membership check verifies a peer ACP node\'s ACP
certificate trust chain, it will also verify the signing certificate,
which is the compromised and/or revoked sub-CA certificate. Therefore,
ACP domain membership for an ACP node enrolled by a compromised and
discovered ACP registrar will fail.[¶](#section-9.2.4-2){.pilcrow}

ACP nodes enrolled by a compromised ACP registrar would automatically
fail to establish ACP channels and ACP domain certificate renewal via
EST and therefore revert to their role as candidate ACP members and
attempt to get a new ACP certificate from an ACP registrar, for example,
via BRSKI. As a result, ACP registrars that have an associated sub-CA
make isolating and resolving issues with compromised registrars
easier.[¶](#section-9.2.4-3){.pilcrow}

Note that ACP registrars with sub-CA functionality also can control the
lifetime of ACP certificates more easily and therefore can be used as a
tool to introduce short-lived certificates and to no longer rely on CRL,
whereas the certificates for the sub-CAs themselves could be longer
lived and subject to CRL.[¶](#section-9.2.4-4){.pilcrow}

    including a human decision in a
    NOC.[¶](#section-9.2.5-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-9.2.5-2.1}

and/or the ACP node certificate renewal process, for example, which ACP
address prefix to assign. Likewise, the ACP registrar would report any

interfaces are enabled by default (e.g., without operator
configuration), such as most L2 switches, this would be less of a change
in behavior than in most L3 devices (e.g., routers), where interfaces

common for configuration to change interfaces to a physically disabled
state, and this would break the ACP.[¶](#section-9.3-1){.pilcrow}

In this section, we discuss a suggested operational model to enable and

packets necessary to operate ACP (or BRSKI) \-- but not any other data
plane packets. Unless the data plane is explicitly configured and
enabled, all packets that are not required for ACP/BRSKI should be
filtered on input and output.[¶](#section-9.3.1-1){.pilcrow}

Both BRSKI and ACP require link-local-only IPv6 operations on interfaces
and DULL GRASP. IPv6 link-local operations mean the minimum signaling to
auto-assign an IPv6 link-local address and talk to neighbors via their
link-local addresses: SLAAC \[[RFC4862](#RFC4862){.xref}\] and ND
\[[RFC4861](#RFC4861){.xref}\]. When the device is a BRSKI pledge, it
may also require TCP/TLS connections to BRSKI proxies on the interface.
When the device has keying material, and the ACP is running, it requires
DULL GRASP packets and packets necessary for the secure channel
mechanism it supports, e.g., IKEv2 and IPsec ESP packets or DTLS packets
to the IPv6 link-local address of an ACP neighbor on the interface. It
also requires TCP/TLS packets for its BRSKI proxy functionality if it

#### [9.3.2.](#section-9.3.2){.section-number .selfRef} [\"admin down\" State](#name-admin-down-state){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-admin-down-state}

Interfaces on most network equipment have at least two states: \"up\"
and \"down\". These may have product-specific names. For example,
\"down\" could be called \"shutdown\", and \"up\" could be called \"no
shutdown\". The \"down\" state disables all interface operations down to
the physical level. The \"up\" state enables the interface enough for
all possible L2/L3 services to operate on top of it, and it may also
auto-enable some subset of them. More commonly, the operations of
various L2/L3 services are controlled via additional node-wide or
interface-level options, but they all become active only when the
interface is not \"down\". Therefore, an easy way to ensure that all
L2/L3 operations on an interface are inactive is to put the interface
into \"down\" state. The fact that this also physically shuts down the
interface is just a side effect in many cases, but it may be important
in other cases (see [Section
9.3.2.2](#down-fast-state-propagation){.xref}).[¶](#section-9.3.2-1){.pilcrow}

A common problem of remote management is the operator or SDN controller
cutting its own connectivity to the remote node via configuration,
impacting its own management connection to the node. The ACP itself
should have no dedicated configuration other than the aforementioned
enabling of the ACP on brownfield ACP nodes. This leaves configuration
that cannot distinguish between the ACP and data plane as sources of
configuration mistakes as these commands will impact the ACP even though
they should only impact the data plane.[¶](#section-9.3.2-2){.pilcrow}

The one ubiquitous type of command that does this on many types of
routers is the interface \"down\" command/configuration. When such a
command is applied to the interface through which the ACP provides
access for remote management, it cuts the remote management connection
through the ACP because, as outlined above, the \"down\" command
typically impacts the physical layer, too, and not only the data plane
services.[¶](#section-9.3.2-3){.pilcrow}

To provide ACP/ANI resilience against such operator misconfiguration,
this document recommends separating the \"down\" state of interfaces
into an \"admin down\" state, where the physical layer is kept running
and the ACP/ANI can use the interface, and a \"physical down\" state.
Any existing \"down\" configurations would map to \"admin down\". In
\"admin down\", any existing L2/L3 services of the data plane should see
no difference to \"physical down\" state. To ensure that no data plane
packets could be sent or received, packet filtering could be established
automatically as described in [Section
9.3.1](#secure-enabling){.xref}.[¶](#section-9.3.2-4){.pilcrow}

An example of ANI, but not ACP, traffic that should be permitted to pass
even in \"admin down\" state is BRSKI enrollment traffic between a BRSKI
pledge and a BRSKI proxy.[¶](#section-9.3.2-5){.pilcrow}

New configuration options could be introduced as necessary (see
discussion below) to issue \"physical down\". The options should be
provided with additional checks to minimize the risk of issuing them in
a way that breaks the ACP without automatic restoration. Examples of
checks include not allowing the option to be issued from a control
connection (NETCONF/SSH) that goes across the interface itself (\"do not
disconnect yourself\") or only applying the option after additional
reconfirmation.[¶](#section-9.3.2-6){.pilcrow}

Interfaces are physically brought down (or left in default \"down\"
state) as a form of security. The \"admin down\" state as described
above also provides also a high level of security because it only
permits ACP/ANI operations, which are both well secured. Ultimately, it
is subject to the deployment\'s security review whether \"admin down\"
is a feasible replacement for \"physical
down\".[¶](#section-9.3.2.1-1){.pilcrow}

The need to trust the security of ACP/ANI operations needs to be weighed
against the operational benefits of permitting the following: consider
the typical example of a CPE (customer premises equipment) with no
on-site network expert. User ports are in \"physical down\" state unless
explicitly configured not to be. In a misconfiguration situation, the
uplink connection is incorrectly plugged into such a user port. The
device is disconnected from the network, and therefore diagnostics from
the network side are no longer possible. Alternatively, all ports
default to \"admin down\". The ACP (but not the data plane) would still
automatically form. Diagnostics from the network side are possible, and
operator reaction could include either to make this port the operational
uplink port or to instruct re-cabling. Security wise, only the ACP/ANI
could be attacked, all other functions are filtered on interfaces in
\"admin down\" state.[¶](#section-9.3.2.1-2){.pilcrow}

The \"physical down\" state propagates on many interface types (e.g.,
Ethernet) to the other side. This can trigger fast L2/L3 protocol
reaction on the other side, and \"admin down\" would not have the same
(fast) result.[¶](#section-9.3.2.2-1){.pilcrow}

Bringing interfaces to \"physical down\" state is, to the best of our
knowledge, always a result of operator action and, today, never the
result of autonomic L2/L3 services running on the nodes. Therefore, one
option is to end the operator\'s reliance on interface state propagation
via the subnet link or physical layer. This may not be possible when
both sides are under the control of different operators, but in that
case, it is unlikely that the ACP is running across the link, and
actually putting the interface into \"physical down\" state may still be
a good option.[¶](#section-9.3.2.2-2){.pilcrow}

Ideally, fast physical state propagation is replaced by fast
software-driven state propagation. For example, a DULL GRASP
\"admin-state\" objective could be used to autoconfigure a BFD session
(\"[Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)](#RFC5880){.xref}\"
\[[RFC5880](#RFC5880){.xref}\]) between the two sides of the link that
would be used to propagate the \"up\" vs. \"admin down\"
state.[¶](#section-9.3.2.2-3){.pilcrow}

Triggering \"physical down\" state may also be used as a means of
diagnosing cabling issues in the absence of easier methods. It is more
complex than automated neighbor diagnostics because it requires
coordinated remote access to (likely) both sides of a link to determine
whether up/down toggling will cause the same reaction on the remote
side.[¶](#section-9.3.2.2-4){.pilcrow}

See [Section 9.1](#diagnostics){.xref} for a discussion about how LLDP
and/or diagnostics via GRASP could be used to provide neighbor
diagnostics and therefore hopefully eliminate the need for \"physical
down\" for neighbor diagnostics \-- as long as both neighbors support
ACP/ANI.[¶](#section-9.3.2.2-5){.pilcrow}

The \"physical down\" state is used to diagnose low-level interface
behavior when higher-layer services (e.g., IPv6) are not working.
Ethernet links are especially subject to a wide variety of possible
incorrect configurations/cablings if they do not support automatic
selection of variable parameters such as speed (10/100/1000 Mbps),
crossover (automatic medium-dependent interface crossover (MDI-X)), and
connector (fiber, copper \-- when interfaces have multiple but can only
enable one at a time). The need for low-level link diagnostics can
therefore be minimized by using fully autoconfiguring
links.[¶](#section-9.3.2.3-1){.pilcrow}

In addition to the \"physical down\" state, low-level diagnostics of
Ethernet or other interfaces also involve the creation of other states
on interfaces, such as physical loopback (internal and/or external) or
the bringing down of all packet transmissions for reflection and/or
cable-length measurements. Any of these options would disrupt ACP as
well.[¶](#section-9.3.2.3-2){.pilcrow}

In cases where such low-level diagnostics of an operational link are
desired but where the link could be a single point of failure for the
ACP, the ASA on both nodes of the link could perform a negotiated
diagnostic that automatically terminates in a predetermined manner
without dependence on external input, ensuring the link will become
operational again.[¶](#section-9.3.2.3-3){.pilcrow}

Power consumption of \"physical down\" interfaces may be significantly
lower than those in \"admin down\" state, for example, on long-range

The interface-level configuration option \"ACP enable\" enables ACP

DULL GRASP. The interface-level configuration option \"ANI enable\" on

there is no domain certificate on the node. On ACP/BRSKI nodes, only
\"ANI enable\" may need to be supported and not \"ACP enable\". Unless
overridden by global configuration options (see [Section
9.3.4](#if-enable-auto){.xref}), either \"ACP enable\" or \"ANI enable\"

[Section 6.4](#discovery-grasp){.xref} requires that \"ACP enable\" is
automatically set on native interfaces, but not on non-native interfaces
(reminder: a native interface is one that exists without operator
configuration action, such as physical interfaces in physical
devices).[¶](#section-9.3.4-1){.pilcrow}

Ideally, \"ACP enable\" is set automatically on all interfaces that
provide access to additional connectivity, which allows more nodes of
the ACP domain to be reached. The best set of interfaces necessary to
achieve this is not possible to determine automatically. Native
interfaces are the best automatic
approximation.[¶](#section-9.3.4-2){.pilcrow}

Consider an ACP domain of ACP nodes transitively connected via native
interfaces. A data plane tunnel between two of these nodes that are
nonadjacent is created, and \"ACP enable\" is set for that tunnel. ACP
RPL sees this tunnel as just as a single hop. Routes in the ACP would
use this hop as an attractive path element to connect regions adjacent
to the tunnel nodes. As a result, the actual hop-by-hop paths used by
traffic in the ACP can become worse. In addition, correct forwarding in
the ACP now depends on correct data plane forwarding configuration
including QoS, filtering, and other security on the data plane path
across which this tunnel runs. This is the main reason why \"ACP/ANI
enable\" should not be set automatically on non-native
interfaces.[¶](#section-9.3.4-3){.pilcrow}

If the tunnel would connect two previously disjoint ACP regions, then it
likely would be useful for the ACP. A data plane tunnel could also run
across nodes without ACP and provide additional connectivity for an
already connected ACP network. The benefit of this additional ACP
redundancy has to be weighed against the problems of relying on the data
plane. If a tunnel connects two separate ACP regions, how many tunnels
should be created to connect these ACP regions reliably enough? Between
which nodes? These are all standard tunneled network design questions
not specific to the ACP, and there are no generic, fully automated
answers.[¶](#section-9.3.4-4){.pilcrow}

Instead of automatically setting \"ACP enable\" on these types of
interfaces, the decision needs to be based on the use purpose of the
non-native interface, and \"ACP enable\" needs to be set in conjunction
with the mechanism through which the non-native interface is created
and/or configured.[¶](#section-9.3.4-5){.pilcrow}

In addition to the explicit setting of \"ACP/ANI enable\", non-native
interfaces also need to support configuration of the ACP RPL cost of the
link to avoid the problems of attracting too much traffic to the link as
described above.[¶](#section-9.3.4-6){.pilcrow}

Even native interfaces may not be able to automatically perform BRSKI or
ACP because they may require additional operator input to become
operational. Examples include DSL interfaces requiring Point-to-Point
Protocol over Ethernet (PPPoE) credentials or mobile interfaces
requiring credentials from a SIM card. Whatever mechanism is used to
provide the necessary configuration to the device to enable the
interface can also be expanded to decide whether or not to set \"ACP/ANI
enable\".[¶](#section-9.3.4-7){.pilcrow}

The goal of automatically setting \"ACP/ANI enable\" on interfaces
(native or not) is to eliminate unnecessary \"touches\" to the node to
make its operation as much as possible \"zero-touch\" with respect to
ACP/ANI. If there are \"unavoidable touches\" such a creating and/or
configuring a non-native interface or provisioning credentials for a
native interface, then \"ACP/ANI enable\" should be added as an option
to that \"touch\". If an erroneous \"touch\" is easily fixed (does not
create another high-cost touch), then the default should be not to
enable ANI/ACP, and if it is potentially expensive or slow to fix (e.g.,
parameters on SIM card shipped to remote location), then the default
should be to enable ACP/ANI.[¶](#section-9.3.4-8){.pilcrow}

A node-level command \"ACP/ANI enable \[up-if-only\]\" enables ACP or

explicit through operator action as described in [Section

A \"brownfield\" node is one that already has a configured data
plane.[¶](#section-9.3.5.1-1){.pilcrow}

Executing global \"ACP/ANI enable \[up-if-only\]\" on each node is the
only command necessary to create an ACP across a network of brownfield
nodes once all the nodes have a domain certificate. When BRSKI is used
(\"ANI enable\"), provisioning of the certificates only requires the
setup of a single BRSKI registrar node, which could also implement a CA
for the network. This is the simplest way to introduce ACP/ANI into
existing (i.e., brownfield) networks.[¶](#section-9.3.5.1-2){.pilcrow}

The need to explicitly enable ACP/ANI is especially important in
brownfield nodes because otherwise software updates may introduce
support for ACP/ANI. The automatic enabling of ACP/ANI in networks where
the operator does not want ACP/ANI or has likely never even heard of it
could be quite irritating to the operator, especially when \"down\"
behavior is changed to \"admin down\".[¶](#section-9.3.5.1-3){.pilcrow}

Automatically setting \"ANI enable\" on brownfield nodes where the
operator is unaware of BRSKI and MASA operations could also be an
unlikely, but critical, security issue. If an attacker could impersonate
the operator by registering as the operator at the MASA or otherwise
getting hold of vouchers and could get enough physical access to the
network so pledges would register to an attacking registrar, then the
attacker could gain access to the ACP and, through the ACP, gain access
to the data plane.[¶](#section-9.3.5.1-4){.pilcrow}

In networks where the operator explicitly enables the ANI, this could
not happen because the operator would create a BRSKI registrar that
would discover attack attempts, and the operator would set up his
registrar with the MASA. Nodes requiring \"ownership vouchers\" would
not be subject to that attack. See \[[RFC8995](#RFC8995){.xref}\] for
more details. Note that a global \"ACP enable\" alone is not subject to
these types of attacks because they always depend on some other
mechanism first to provision domain certificates into the
device.[¶](#section-9.3.5.1-5){.pilcrow}

An ACP \"greenfield\" node is one that does not have any prior
configuration and that can be bootstrapped into the ACP across the
network. To support greenfield nodes, ACP as described in this document
needs to be combined with a bootstrap protocol and/or mechanism that
will enroll the node with the ACP keying material: the ACP certificate
and the TA. For ANI nodes, this protocol/mechanism is
BRSKI.[¶](#section-9.3.5.2-1){.pilcrow}

When such a node is powered on and determines that it is in greenfield
condition, it enables the bootstrap protocol(s) and/or mechanism(s).
Once the ACP keying material is enrolled, the greenfield state ends and
the ACP is started. When BRSKI is used, the node\'s state reflects this
by setting \"ANI enable\" upon determination of greenfield state when it
is powered on.[¶](#section-9.3.5.2-2){.pilcrow}

ACP greenfield nodes that, in the absence of ACP, would have their
interfaces in \"down\" state [SHOULD]{.bcp14} set all native interfaces
into \"admin down\" state and only permit data plane traffic required
for the bootstrap protocol and/or
mechanisms.[¶](#section-9.3.5.2-3){.pilcrow}

The ACP greenfield state ends either through the successful enrollment
of ACP keying material (certificate and TA) or the detection of a
permitted termination of ACP greenfield
operations.[¶](#section-9.3.5.2-4){.pilcrow}

ACP nodes supporting greenfield operations [MAY]{.bcp14} want to provide
backward compatibility with other forms of configuration and/or
provisioning, especially when only a subset of nodes are expected to be
deployed with ACP. Such an ACP node [SHOULD]{.bcp14} observe attempts to
provision or configure the node via interfaces and/or methods that
traditionally indicate physical possession of the node, such as a serial
or USB console port or a USB memory stick with a bootstrap
configuration. When such an operation is observed before enrollment of
the ACP keying material has completed, the node [SHOULD]{.bcp14} put
itself into the state the node would have been in if ACP/ANI was
disabled at boot. This terminates ACP greenfield
operations.[¶](#section-9.3.5.2-5){.pilcrow}

When an ACP greenfield node enables multiple, automated ACP or non-ACP
enrollment and/or bootstrap protocols or mechanisms in parallel, care
must be taken not to terminate any protocol/mechanism before the others
either have succeeded in enrolling ACP keying material or have
progressed to a point of permitted termination for ACP greenfield
operations.[¶](#section-9.3.5.2-6){.pilcrow}

Highly secure ACP greenfield nodes may not permit any reason to
terminate ACP greenfield operations, including physical
access.[¶](#section-9.3.5.2-7){.pilcrow}

Nodes that claim to support ANI greenfield operations [SHOULD
NOT]{.bcp14} enable in parallel to BRSKI any enrollment/bootstrap
protocol/mechanism that allows Trust On First Use (TOFU,
\"[Opportunistic Security: Some Protection Most of the
Time](#RFC7435){.xref}\" \[[RFC7435](#RFC7435){.xref}\]) over interfaces
other than those traditionally indicating physical possession of the
node. Protocols/mechanisms with published default username/password
authentication are considered to suffer from TOFU. Securing the
bootstrap protocol/mechanism by requiring a voucher
\[[RFC8366](#RFC8366){.xref}\] can be used to avoid
TOFU.[¶](#section-9.3.5.2-8){.pilcrow}

In summary, the goal of ACP greenfield support is to allow remote,
automated enrollment of ACP keying materials, and therefore automated
bootstrap into the ACP and to prohibit TOFU during bootstrap with the
likely exception (for backward compatibility) of bootstrapping via
interfaces traditionally indicating physical possession of the
node.[¶](#section-9.3.5.2-9){.pilcrow}

renewal. Configuring this option would be a parameter on the BRSKI

If the option \"up-if-only\" is not selected, interfaces enabled for

The Zone Addressing Sub-Scheme (see [Section
6.11.3](#zone-scheme){.xref}) allows incremental adoption of the ACP in
a network where ACP can be deployed on edge areas, but not across the
core that is connecting those edges.[¶](#section-9.4-1){.pilcrow}

In such a setup, each edge network, such as a branch or campus of an
enterprise network, has a disjoint ACP to which one or more unique
Zone-IDs are assigned: ACP nodes registered for a specific ACP zone have
to receive Zone Addressing Sub-Scheme addresses, for example, by virtue
of configuring for each such zone one or more ACP registrars with that
Zone-ID. All the registrars for these ACP zones need to get ACP
certificates from CAs relying on a common set of TAs and of course the
same ACP domain name.[¶](#section-9.4-2){.pilcrow}

These ACP zones can first be brought up as separate networks without any
connection between them and/or they can be connected across a non-ACP
enabled core network through various non-autonomic operational
practices. For example, each separate ACP zone can have an edge node
that is a L3 VPN PE (MPLS or IPv6 L3VPN), where a complete non-autonomic
ACP-Core VPN is created by using the ACP VRFs and exchanging the routes
from those ACP VRFs across the VPN\'s non-autonomic routing
protocol(s).[¶](#section-9.4-3){.pilcrow}

While such a setup is possible with any ACP addressing sub-scheme, the
Zone Addressing Sub-Scheme makes it easy to configure and scalable for
any VPN routing protocols because every ACP zone only needs to indicate
one or more /64 ACP zone addressing prefix routes into the ACP-Core VPN
as opposed to routes for every individual ACP node as required in the
other ACP addressing schemes.[¶](#section-9.4-4){.pilcrow}

Note that the non-autonomous ACP-Core VPN requires additional extensions
to propagate GRASP messages when GRASP discovery is desired across the
zones.[¶](#section-9.4-5){.pilcrow}

For example, one could set up on each zone edge router a remote ACP
tunnel to a GRASP hub. The GRASP hub could be implemented at the
application level and could run in the NOC of the network. It would
serve to propagate GRASP announcements between ACP zones and/or generate
GRASP announcements for NOC services.[¶](#section-9.4-6){.pilcrow}

Such a partial deployment may prove to be sufficient or could evolve to
become more autonomous through future standardized or nonstandard
enhancements, for example, by allowing GRASP messages to be propagated
across the L3VPN, leveraging for example L3VPN multicast
support.[¶](#section-9.4-7){.pilcrow}

Finally, these partial deployments can be merged into a single,
contiguous ACP that is completely autonomous (given appropriate ACP
support across the core) without changes in the cryptographic material
because the node\'s ACP certificates are from a single
ACP.[¶](#section-9.4-8){.pilcrow}

There is no desirable configuration for the ACP. Instead, all parameters
that need to be configured in support of the ACP are limitations of the
solution, but they are only needed in cases where not all components are
made autonomic. Wherever this is necessary, it relies on preexisting
mechanisms for configuration such as CLI or YANG data models (\"[The

The most important examples of such configuration
include:[¶](#section-9.5-2){.pilcrow}

-   [When ACP nodes do not support an autonomic way to receive an ACP
    certificate, for example, BRSKI, then such a certificate needs to be

    to do this.[¶](#section-9.5-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-9.5-3.1}
-   [Certificate maintenance requires PKI functions. Discovery of these

    physically connected to the ACP, the ACP node to which they attach
    needs to be configured with ACP connect according to [Section
    8.1](#ACPconnect){.xref}. It is also possible to use that single
    physical connection to connect both to the ACP and the data plane of
    the network as explained in [Section
    8.1.4](#SingleIF){.xref}.[¶](#section-9.5-3.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-9.5-3.3}
-   [When devices are not autonomically bootstrapped, explicit
    configuration to enable the ACP needs to be applied. See [Section
    9.3](#enabling-acp){.xref}.[¶](#section-9.5-3.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-9.5-3.4}
-   [When the ACP needs to be extended across interfaces other than L2,
    the ACP as defined in this document cannot auto-discover candidate
    neighbors automatically. Remote neighbors need to be configured, see
    [Section
    8.2](#remote-acp-neighbors){.xref}.[¶](#section-9.5-3.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-9.5-3.5}

Once the ACP is operating, any further configuration for the data plane
can be done more reliably across the ACP itself because the ACP provides
addressing and connectivity (routing) independent of the data plane. For
this, the configuration methods simply need to allow operating across
the ACP VRF, for example, with NETCONF, SSH, or any other
method.[¶](#section-9.5-4){.pilcrow}

The ACP also provides additional security through its hop-by-hop
encryption for any such configuration operations. Some legacy
configuration methods (for example, SNMP, TFTP, or HTTP) may not use
end-to-end encryption, and most of the end-to-end secured configuration
methods still allow for easy, passive observation along the path of the
configuration taking place (for example, transport flows, port numbers,
and/or IP addresses).[¶](#section-9.5-5){.pilcrow}

The ACP can and should be used equally as the transport to configure any
of the aforementioned non-autonomic components of the ACP, but in that
case, the same caution needs to be exercised as with data plane
configuration without the ACP. Misconfiguration may cause the
configuring entity to be disconnected from the node it configures, for
example, when incorrectly unconfiguring a remote ACP neighbor through
which the configured ACP node is reached.[¶](#section-9.5-6){.pilcrow}

    short-lived certificates with lifetimes on the order of OCSP/CRL

    peers (whose certificate was not renewed) at similar speeds as when
    using OCSP/CRL. The same benefit can be achieved when using
    CRL/OCSP, periodically refreshing the revocation information and
    also tearing down ACP secure channels when the peer\'s (long-lived)
    certificate is revoked. There is no requirement for ACP
    implementations to require this enhancement, though, in order to
    keep the mandatory implementations
    simpler.[¶](#section-10.1-2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-10.1-2.3}

The ACP can also sustain network partitions and mergers. Practically all
ACP operations are link local, where a network partition has no impact.
Nodes authenticate each other using the domain certificates to establish
the ACP locally. Addressing inside the ACP remains unchanged, and the
routing protocol inside both parts of the ACP will lead to two working
(although partitioned) ACPs.[¶](#section-10.1-3){.pilcrow}

There are a few central dependencies: a CRL may not be available during
a network partition. This can be addressed by a suitable policy to not
immediately disconnect neighbors when no CRL is available. Also, an ACP
registrar or CA might not be available during a partition. This may
delay renewal of certificates that are to expire in the future, and it
may prevent the enrollment of new nodes during the
partition.[¶](#section-10.1-4){.pilcrow}

Highly resilient ACP designs can be built by using ACP registrars with
embedded sub-CAs, as outlined in [Section 9.2.4](#sub-ca){.xref}. As
long as a partition is left with one or more of such ACP registrars, it
can continue to enroll new candidate ACP nodes as long as the ACP
registrar\'s sub-CA certificate does not expire. Because the ACP
addressing relies on unique Registrar-IDs, a later merging of partitions
will not cause problems with ACP addresses assigned during
partitioning.[¶](#section-10.1-5){.pilcrow}

After a network partition, merging will just establish the previous
status: certificates can be renewed, the CRL is available, and new nodes
can be enrolled everywhere. Since all nodes use the same TA, the merging
will be smooth.[¶](#section-10.1-6){.pilcrow}

Merging two networks with different TAs requires the ACP nodes to trust
the union of TAs. As long as the routing-subdomain hashes are different,
the addressing will not overlap. Overlaps will only happen accidentally
in the unlikely event of a 40-bit hash collision in SHA-256 (see
[Section 6.11](#addressing){.xref}). Note that the complete mechanisms
to merge networks is out of scope of this
specification.[¶](#section-10.1-7){.pilcrow}

It is also highly desirable for an implementation of the ACP to be able
to run it over interfaces that are administratively down. If this is not
feasible, then it might instead be possible to request explicit operator
override upon administrative actions that would administratively bring
down an interface across which the ACP is running, especially if
bringing down the ACP is known to disconnect the operator from the node.
For example, any such administrative down action could perform a
dependency check to see if the transport connection across which this
action is performed is affected by the down action (with default RPL
routing used, packet forwarding will be symmetric, so this is actually
possible to check).[¶](#section-10.1-8){.pilcrow}

As explained in [Section 6](#self-creation){.xref}, the ACP is based on
secure channels built between nodes that have mutually authenticated
each other with their domain certificates. The channels themselves are
protected using standard encryption technologies such as DTLS or IPsec,
which provide additional authentication during channel establishment,
data integrity, and data confidentiality protection inside the ACP, and
also provide replay protection.[¶](#section-10.2.1-1){.pilcrow}

An attacker will not be able to join the ACP unless it has a valid ACP
certificate. An on-path attacker without a valid ACP certificate cannot
inject packets into the ACP due to ACP secure channels. An attacker also
cannot decrypt ACP traffic unless it can crack the encryption. It can
attempt behavioral traffic analysis on the encrypted ACP
traffic.[¶](#section-10.2.1-2){.pilcrow}

The degree to which compromised ACP nodes can impact the ACP depends on
the implementation of the ACP nodes and their impairment. When an
attacker has only gained administrative privileges to configure ACP
nodes remotely, the attacker can disrupt the ACP only through one of the
few configuration options to disable it (see [Section
9.3](#enabling-acp){.xref}) or by the configuring of non-autonomic ACP
options if those are supported on the impaired ACP nodes (see [Section
8](#workarounds){.xref}). Injecting traffic into or extracting traffic
from an impaired ACP node is only possible when an impaired ACP node
supports ACP connect (see [Section 8.1](#ACPconnect){.xref}), and the
attacker can control traffic into/from one of the ACP node\'s
interfaces, such as by having physical access to the ACP
node.[¶](#section-10.2.1-3){.pilcrow}

The ACP also serves as protection (through authentication and
encryption) for protocols relevant to OAM that may not have secured
protocol stack options or where implementation or deployment of those
options fail due to some vendor, product, or customer limitations. This
includes protocols such as SNMP (\"[An Architecture for Describing
Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) Management

\[[RFC5905](#RFC5905){.xref}\], PTP (Precision Time Protocol

protocol references are necessarily the latest version of protocols, but
they are versions that are still widely
deployed.[¶](#section-10.2.1-4){.pilcrow}

Protection via the ACP secure hop-by-hop channels for these protocols is
meant to be only a stopgap, though: the ultimate goal is for these and
other protocols to use end-to-end encryption utilizing the domain
certificate and to rely on the ACP secure channels primarily for
zero-touch reliable connectivity, but not primarily for
security.[¶](#section-10.2.1-5){.pilcrow}

The remaining attack vector would be to attack the underlying ACP
protocols themselves, either via directed attacks or by
denial-of-service attacks. However, as the ACP is built using link-local
IPv6 addresses, remote attacks from the data plane are impossible as
long as the data plane has no facilities to remotely send IPv6
link-local packets. The only exceptions are ACP-connected interfaces,
which require greater physical protection. The ULA addresses are only
reachable inside the ACP context and therefore unreachable from the data
plane. Also, the ACP protocols should be implemented to be attack
resistant and to not consume unnecessary resources even while under
attack.[¶](#section-10.2.1-6){.pilcrow}

The security model of the ACP is based on trusting all members of the
group of nodes that receive an ACP certificate for the same domain.
Attacks from the inside by a compromised group member are therefore the
biggest challenge.[¶](#section-10.2.2-1){.pilcrow}

Group members must be protected against attackers so that there is no
easy way to compromise them or use them as a proxy for attacking other
devices across the ACP. For example, management plane functions
(transport ports) should be reachable only from the ACP and not from the
data plane. This applies especially to those management plane functions
that lack secure end-to-end transport and to which the ACP provides both
automatic, reliable connectivity and protection against attacks.
Protection across all potential attack vectors is typically easier to do
in devices whose software is designed from the beginning with the ACP in
mind than in legacy, software-based systems where the ACP is added on as
another feature.[¶](#section-10.2.2-2){.pilcrow}

As explained above, traffic across the ACP should still be end-to-end
encrypted whenever possible. This includes traffic such as GRASP, EST,
and BRSKI inside the ACP. This minimizes man-in-the-middle attacks by
compromised ACP group members. Such attackers cannot eavesdrop or modify
communications, but they can just filter them (which is unavoidable by
any means).[¶](#section-10.2.2-3){.pilcrow}

An ACP is self-forming, self-managing, and self-protecting; therefore,
it has minimal dependencies on the administrator of the network.
Specifically, since it is (intended to be) independent of configuration,
there is only limited scope for configuration errors on the ACP itself.
The administrator may have the option to enable or disable the entire
approach, but detailed configuration is not possible. This means that
the ACP must not be reflected in the running configuration of nodes,
except for a possible on/off switch (and even that is
undesirable).[¶](#section-10.3-1){.pilcrow}

While configuration (except for [Section 8](#workarounds){.xref} and
[Section 9.2](#registrar-considerations){.xref}) is not possible, an
administrator must have full visibility into the ACP and all its
parameters to be able to troubleshoot. Therefore, an ACP must support
all show and debug options, as with any other network function.
Specifically, an NMS or controller must be able to discover the ACP and
monitor its health. This visibility into ACP operations must clearly be
separated from the visibility of the data plane so automated systems
will never have to deal with ACP aspects unless they explicitly desire
to do so.[¶](#section-10.3-2){.pilcrow}

Since an ACP is self-protecting, a node that does not support the ACP or
that does not have a valid domain certificate cannot connect to it. This
means that by default a traditional controller or NMS cannot connect to
an ACP. See [Section 8.1.1](#NMS){.xref} for details on how to connect
an NMS host to the ACP.[¶](#section-10.3-3){.pilcrow}

A set of ACP nodes with ACP certificates for the same ACP domain and
with ACP functionality enabled is automatically \"self-building\": the
ACP is automatically established between neighboring ACP nodes. It is
also self-protecting: the ACP secure channels are authenticated and
encrypted. No configuration is required for
this.[¶](#section-11-1){.pilcrow}

The self-protecting property does not include workarounds for
non-autonomic components as explained in [Section
8](#workarounds){.xref}. See [Section 10.2](#self-protecting){.xref} for
details of how the ACP protects itself against attacks from the outside
and, to a more limited degree, from the inside as
well.[¶](#section-11-2){.pilcrow}

However, the security of the ACP depends on a number of other
factors:[¶](#section-11-3){.pilcrow}

-   [The usage of domain certificates depends on a valid supporting PKI
    infrastructure. If the chain of trust of this PKI infrastructure is
    compromised, the security of the ACP is also compromised. This is
    typically under the control of the network
    administrator.[¶](#section-11-4.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-11-4.1}
-   [ACP nodes receive their certificates from ACP registrars. These ACP
    registrars are security-critical dependencies of the ACP. Procedures
    and protocols for ACP registrars are outside the scope of this
    specification as explained in [Section
    6.11.7.1](#registrars-protocols){.xref}; only the requirements for
    the resulting ACP certificates are
    specified.[¶](#section-11-4.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-11-4.2}
-   [Every ACP registrar (for enrollment of ACP certificates) and ACP
    EST server (for renewal of ACP certificates) is a security-critical
    entity and its protocols are security-critical protocols. Both need
    to be hardened against attacks, similar to a CA and its protocols. A
    malicious registrar can enroll malicious nodes to an ACP network (if
    the CA delegates this policy to the registrar) or break ACP routing,
    for example, by assigning duplicate ACP addresses to ACP nodes via
    their ACP
    certificates.[¶](#section-11-4.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-11-4.3}
-   [ACP nodes that are ANI nodes rely on BRSKI as the protocol for ACP
    registrars. For ANI-type ACP nodes, the security considerations of
    BRSKI apply. It enables automated, secure enrollment of ACP
    certificates.[¶](#section-11-4.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-11-4.4}
-   [BRSKI and potentially other ACP registrar protocol options require
    that nodes have an (X.509 v3 based) IDevID. IDevIDs are an option
    for ACP registrars to securely identify candidate ACP nodes that
    should be enrolled into an ACP
    domain.[¶](#section-11-4.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-11-4.5}
-   [For IDevIDs to securely identify the node to which its IDevID is
    assigned, the node needs (1) to utilize hardware support such as a
    Trusted Platform Module (TPM) to protect against extraction and/or
    cloning of the private key of the IDevID and (2) a hardware/software
    infrastructure to prohibit execution of unauthenticated software to
    protect against malicious use of the
    IDevID.[¶](#section-11-4.6){.pilcrow}]{#section-11-4.6}
-   [Like the IDevID, the ACP certificate should equally be protected
    from extraction or other abuse by the same ACP node infrastructure.
    This infrastructure for IDevID and ACP certificate is beneficial
    independent of the ACP registrar protocol used (BRSKI or
    other).[¶](#section-11-4.7){.pilcrow}]{#section-11-4.7}
-   [Renewal of ACP certificates requires support for EST; therefore,
    the security considerations of \[[RFC7030](#RFC7030){.xref}\]
    related to certificate renewal and/or rekeying and TP renewal apply
    to the ACP. EST security considerations when using other than mutual
    certificate authentication do not apply, nor do considerations for
    initial enrollment via EST apply, except for ANI-type ACP nodes
    because BRSKI leverages
    EST.[¶](#section-11-4.8){.pilcrow}]{#section-11-4.8}
-   [A malicious ACP node could declare itself to be an EST server via
    GRASP across the ACP if malicious software could be executed on it.
    The CA should therefore authenticate only known trustworthy EST
    servers, such as nodes with hardware protections against malicious
    software. When registrars use their ACP certificate to authenticate
    towards a CA, the id-kp-cmcRA \[[RFC6402](#RFC6402){.xref}\]
    extended key usage attribute allows the CA to determine that the ACP
    node was permitted during enrollment to act as an ACP registrar.
    Without the ability to talk to the CA, a malicious EST server can
    still attract ACP nodes attempting to renew their keying material,
    but they will fail to perform successful renewal of a valid ACP
    certificate. The ACP node attempting to use the malicious EST server
    can then continue to use a different EST server and log a failure
    against a malicious EST
    server.[¶](#section-11-4.9){.pilcrow}]{#section-11-4.9}
-   [Malicious on-path ACP nodes may filter valid EST server
    announcements across the ACP, but such malicious ACP nodes could
    equally filter any ACP traffic such as the EST traffic itself.
    Either attack requires the ability to execute malicious software on
    an impaired ACP node,
    though.[¶](#section-11-4.10){.pilcrow}]{#section-11-4.10}
-   [In the absence of malicious software injection, an attacker that
    can misconfigure an ACP node that supports EST server functionality
    could attempt to configure a malicious CA. This would not result in
    the ability to successfully renew ACP certificates, but it could
    result in DoS attacks by becoming an EST server and by making ACP
    nodes attempt their ACP certificate renewal via this impaired ACP
    node. This problem can be avoided when the EST server implementation
    can verify that the configured CA is indeed providing renewal for
    certificates of the node\'s ACP. The ability to do so depends on the
    protocol between the EST server and the CA, which is outside the
    scope of this
    document.[¶](#section-11-4.11){.pilcrow}]{#section-11-4.11}

In summary, attacks against the PKI/certificate dependencies of the ACP
can be minimized by a variety of hardware and/or software components,
including options such as TPM for IDevID and/or ACP certificate,
prohibitions against the execution of untrusted software, and design
aspects of the EST server functionality for the ACP that eliminate
configuration-level impairment.[¶](#section-11-5){.pilcrow}

Because ACP peers select one out of potentially more than one mutually
supported ACP secure channel protocols via the approach described in
[Section 6.6](#channel-selection){.xref}, ACP secure channel setup is
subject to downgrade attacks by MITM attackers. This can be discovered
after such an attack by additional mechanisms described in [Appendix
A.9.9](#downgrade){.xref}. Alternatively, more advanced channel
selection mechanisms can be devised.[¶](#section-11-6){.pilcrow}

The security model of the ACP as defined in this document is tailored
for use with private PKI. The TA of a private PKI provides the security
against maliciously created ACP certificates that give access to an ACP.
Such attacks can create fake ACP certificates with correct-looking
AcpNodeNames, but those certificates would not pass the certificate path
validation of the ACP domain membership check (see [Section
6.2.3](#certcheck){.xref}, point 2).[¶](#section-11-7){.pilcrow}

There is no prevention of source-address spoofing inside the ACP. This
implies that if an attacker gains access to the ACP, it can spoof all
addresses inside the ACP and fake messages from any other node. New
protocols and/or services running across the ACP should therefore use
end-to-end authentication inside the ACP. This is already done by GRASP
as specified in this document.[¶](#section-11-8){.pilcrow}

The ACP is designed to enable automation of current network management
and the management of future autonomic peer-to-peer/distributed
networks. Any ACP member can send ACP IPv6 packets to other ACP members
and announce via ACP GRASP services to all ACP members without depending
on centralized components.[¶](#section-11-9){.pilcrow}

The ACP relies on peer-to-peer authentication and authorization using
ACP certificates. This security model is necessary to enable the
autonomic ad hoc, any-to-any connectivity between ACP nodes. It provides
infrastructure protection through hop-by-hop authentication and
encryption \-- without relying on third parties. For any services where
this complete autonomic peer-to-peer group security model is
appropriate, the ACP certificate can also be used unchanged, for
example, for any type of data plane routing protocol
security.[¶](#section-11-10){.pilcrow}

This ACP security model is designed primarily to protect against attack
from the outside, not against attacks from the inside. To protect
against spoofing attacks from compromised on-path ACP nodes, end-to-end
encryption inside the ACP is used by new ACP signaling: GRASP across the
ACP using TLS. The same is expected from any non-legacy services or
protocols using the ACP. Because no group keys are used, there is no
risk of impacted nodes accessing end-to-end encrypted traffic from other
ACP nodes.[¶](#section-11-11){.pilcrow}

Attacks from impacted ACP nodes against the ACP are more difficult than
against the data plane because of the autoconfiguration of the ACP and
the absence of configuration options that could be abused to change or
break ACP behavior. This is excluding configuration for workaround in
support of non-autonomic components.[¶](#section-11-12){.pilcrow}

Mitigation against compromised ACP members is possible through standard
automated certificate management mechanisms including revocation and
nonrenewal of short-lived certificates. In this specification, there are
no further optimizations of these mechanisms defined for the ACP (but
see [Appendix A.9.8](#compromised){.xref}).[¶](#section-11-13){.pilcrow}

Higher-layer service built using ACP certificates should not solely rely
on undifferentiated group security when another model is more
appropriate or more secure. For example, central network configuration
relies on a security model where only a few especially trusted nodes are
allowed to configure the data plane of network nodes (CLI, NETCONF).
This can be done through ACP certificates by differentiating them and
introducing roles. See [Appendix
A.9.5](#role-assignments){.xref}.[¶](#section-11-14){.pilcrow}

Operators and developers of provisioning software need to be aware of
how the provisioning and configuration of network devices impacts the
ability of the operator and/or provisioning software to remotely access
the network nodes. By using the ACP, most of the issues of
provisioning/configuration causing connectivity loss of remote
provisioning and configuration will be eliminated, see [Section
6](#self-creation){.xref}. Only a few exceptions, such as explicit
physical interface down configuration, will be left. See [Section
9.3.2](#admin-down){.xref}.[¶](#section-11-15){.pilcrow}

Many details of ACP are designed with security in mind and discussed
elsewhere in the document.[¶](#section-11-16){.pilcrow}

IPv6 addresses used by nodes in the ACP are covered as part of the
node\'s domain certificate as described in [Section
6.2.2](#domcert-acpinfo){.xref}. This allows even verification of
ownership of a peer\'s IPv6 address when using a connection
authenticated with the domain certificate.[¶](#section-11-17){.pilcrow}

The ACP acts as a security (and transport) substrate for GRASP inside
the ACP such that GRASP is not only protected by attacks from the
outside, but also by attacks from compromised inside attackers \-- by
relying not only on hop-by-hop security of ACP secure channels, but also
by adding end-to-end security for those GRASP messages. See [Section
6.9.2](#GRASP-substrate){.xref}.[¶](#section-11-18){.pilcrow}

ACP provides for secure, resilient zero-touch discovery of EST servers
for certificate renewal. See [Section
6.2.5](#domcert-maint){.xref}.[¶](#section-11-19){.pilcrow}

ACP provides extensible, autoconfiguring hop-by-hop protection of the
ACP infrastructure via the negotiation of hop-by-hop secure channel
protocols. See [Section
6.6](#channel-selection){.xref}.[¶](#section-11-20){.pilcrow}

The ACP is designed to minimize attacks from the outside by minimizing
its dependency on any non-ACP (data plane) operations and/or
configuration on a node. See also [Section
6.13.2](#general_addressing){.xref}.[¶](#section-11-21){.pilcrow}

In combination with BRSKI, ACP enables a resilient, fully zero-touch
network solution for short-lived certificates that can be renewed or
reenrolled even after unintentional expiry (e.g., due to interrupted
connectivity). See [Appendix
A.2](#bootstrap){.xref}.[¶](#section-11-22){.pilcrow}

Because ACP secure channels can be long lived, but certificates used may
be short-lived, secure channels, for example, built via IPsec, need to
be terminated when peer certificates expire. See [Section
6.8.5](#Profiles){.xref}.[¶](#section-11-23){.pilcrow}

[Section 7.2](#acp-l2-switches-how){.xref} describes how to implement a
routed ACP topology operating on what effectively is a large bridge
domain when using L3/L2 routers that operate at L2 in the data plane. In
this case, the ACP is subject to a much higher likelihood of attacks by
other nodes \"stealing\" L2 addresses than in the actual routed case,
especially when the bridged network includes untrusted devices such as
hosts. This is a generic issue in L2 LANs. L2/L3 devices often already
have some form of \"port security\" to prohibit this. They rely on
Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) or DHCP learning which
port/MAC-address and IPv6 address belong together and blocking MAC/IPv6
source addresses from wrong ports. This type of function needs to be
enabled to prohibit DoS attacks and specifically to protect the ACP.
Likewise, the GRASP DULL instance needs to ensure that the IPv6 address
in the locator-option matches the source IPv6 address of the DULL GRASP
packet.[¶](#section-11-24){.pilcrow}

## [Appendix A.](#section-appendix.a){.section-number .selfRef} [Background and Future (Informative)](#name-background-and-future-infor){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-background-and-future-infor}

The following sections provide background information about aspects of
the normative parts of this document or associated mechanisms such as
BRSKI (such as why specific choices were made by the ACP), and they
discuss possible future variations of the
ACP.[¶](#section-appendix.a-1){.pilcrow}

## [A.1.](#section-a.1){.section-number .selfRef} [ACP Address Space Schemes](#name-acp-address-space-schemes){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-acp-address-space-schemes}

This document defines the Zone, Vlong, and Manual Addressing Sub-Schemes
primarily to support address prefix assignment via distributed,
potentially uncoordinated ACP registrars as defined in [Section
6.11.7](#acp-registrars){.xref}. This costs a 48/46-bit identifier so
that these ACP registrars can assign nonconflicting address prefixes.
This design does not leave enough bits to simultaneously support a large
number of nodes (Node-ID), plus a large prefix of local addresses for
every node, plus a large enough set of bits to identify a routing zone.
As a result, the Zone and Vlong 8/16 Addressing Sub-Schemes attempt to
support all features but via separate
prefixes.[¶](#section-a.1-1){.pilcrow}

In networks that expect always to rely on a centralized PMS as described
[Section 9.2.5](#pms){.xref}, the 48/46-bits for the Registrar-ID could
be saved. Such variations of the ACP addressing mechanisms could be
introduced through future work in different ways. If a new otherName was
introduced, incompatible ACP variations could be created where every
design aspect of the ACP could be changed, including all addressing
choices. If instead a new addressing sub-scheme would be defined, it
could be a backward-compatible extension of this ACP specification.
Information such as the size of a zone prefix and the length of the
prefix assigned to the ACP node itself could be encoded via the
extension field of the acp-node-name.[¶](#section-a.1-2){.pilcrow}

Note that an explicitly defined Manual Addressing Sub-Scheme is always
beneficial to provide an easy way for ACP nodes to prohibit incorrect
non-autonomic configuration of any non-\"Manual\" ACP address spaces and
therefore ensure that such non-autonomic operations will never impact
correct routing for any non-\"Manual\" ACP addresses assigned via ACP
certificates.[¶](#section-a.1-3){.pilcrow}

::: {#bootstrap}

## [A.2.](#section-a.2){.section-number .selfRef} [BRSKI Bootstrap (ANI)](#name-brski-bootstrap-ani){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-brski-bootstrap-ani}

BRSKI describes how nodes with an IDevID certificate can securely and
zero-touch enroll with an LDevID certificate to support the ACP. BRSKI
also leverages the ACP to enable zero-touch bootstrap of new nodes
across networks without any configuration requirements across the
transit nodes (e.g., no DHCP, DNS forwarding, and/or server setup). This
includes otherwise unconfigured networks as described in [Section
3.2](#secure-bootstrap){.xref}. Therefore, BRSKI in conjunction with ACP
provides for a secure and zero-touch management solution for complete
networks. Nodes supporting such an infrastructure (BRSKI and ACP) are
called ANI nodes (Autonomic Networking Infrastructure), see
\[[RFC8993](#RFC8993){.xref}\]. Nodes that do not support an IDevID
certificate but only an (insecure) vendor-specific Unique Device
Identifier (UDI) or nodes whose manufacturer does not support a MASA
could use some future, reduced-security version of
BRSKI.[¶](#section-a.2-1){.pilcrow}

When BRSKI is used to provision a domain certificate (which is called
enrollment), the BRSKI registrar (acting as an enhanced EST server) must
include the otherName / AcpNodeName encoded ACP address and domain name
to the enrolling node (called a pledge) via its response to the
pledge\'s EST CSR Attributes Request that is mandatory in
BRSKI.[¶](#section-a.2-2){.pilcrow}

The CA in an ACP network must not change the otherName / AcpNodeName in
the certificate. The ACP nodes can therefore find their ACP addresses
and domain using this field in the domain certificate, both for
themselves as well as for other nodes.[¶](#section-a.2-3){.pilcrow}

The use of BRSKI in conjunction with the ACP can also help to further
simplify maintenance and renewal of domain certificates. Instead of
relying on CRL, the lifetime of certificates can be made extremely
small, for example, on the order of hours. When a node fails to connect
to the ACP within its certificate lifetime, it cannot connect to the ACP
to renew its certificate across it (using just EST), but it can still
renew its certificate as an \"enrolled/expired pledge\" via the BRSKI
bootstrap proxy. This requires only that the BRSKI registrar honors
expired domain certificates and that the pledge attempts to perform TLS
authentication for BRSKI bootstrap using its expired domain certificate
before falling back to attempting to use its IDevID certificate for
BRSKI. This mechanism could also render CRLs unnecessary because the
BRSKI registrar in conjunction with the CA would not renew revoked
certificates \-- only a \"Do-not-renew\" list would be necessary on the
BRSKI registrar/CA.[¶](#section-a.2-4){.pilcrow}

In the absence of BRSKI or less secure variants thereof, the
provisioning of certificates may involve one or more touches or
nonstandardized automation. Node vendors usually support the
provisioning of certificates into nodes via PKCS #7 (see \"[PKCS #7:
Cryptographic Message Syntax Version 1.5](#RFC2315){.xref}\"
\[[RFC2315](#RFC2315){.xref}\]) and may support this provisioning
through vendor-specific models via NETCONF (\"[Network Configuration
Protocol (NETCONF)](#RFC6241){.xref}\" \[[RFC6241](#RFC6241){.xref}\]).
If such nodes also support NETCONF Zero Touch
\[[RFC8572](#RFC8572){.xref}\], then this can be combined with
zero-touch provisioning of domain certificates into nodes. Unless there
is the equivalent integration of NETCONF connections across the ACP as
there is in BRSKI, this combination would not support zero-touch
bootstrap across an unconfigured network,
though.[¶](#section-a.2-5){.pilcrow}

LLDP and Cisco\'s earlier Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) are examples of
L2 discovery protocols that terminate their messages on L2 ports. If
those protocols had been chosen for ACP neighbor discovery, ACP neighbor
discovery would also have terminated on L2 ports. This would have
prevented ACP construction over non-ACP-capable, but LLDP- or
CDP-enabled L2 switches. LLDP has extensions using different MAC
addresses, and this could have been an option for ACP discovery as well,
but the additional required IEEE standardization and definition of a
profile for such a modified instance of LLDP seemed to be more work than
the benefit of \"reusing the existing protocol\" LLDP for this very
simple purpose.[¶](#section-a.3.1-1){.pilcrow}

Multicast DNS (mDNS) \"[Multicast DNS](#RFC6762){.xref}\"
\[[RFC6762](#RFC6762){.xref}\] with DNS Service Discovery (DNS-SD)
Resource Records (RRs) as defined in \"[DNS-Based Service
Discovery](#RFC6763){.xref}\" \[[RFC6763](#RFC6763){.xref}\] was a key
contender as an ACP discovery protocol. Because it relies on link-local
IP multicast, it operates at the subnet level and is also found in L2
switches. The authors of this document are not aware of an mDNS
implementation that terminates its mDNS messages on L2 ports instead of
on the subnet level. If mDNS was used as the ACP discovery mechanism on
an ACP-capable (L3)/L2 switch as outlined in [Section
7](#acp-l2-switches){.xref}, then this would be necessary to implement.
It is likely that termination of mDNS messages could only be applied to
all mDNS messages from such a port, which would then make it necessary
to software forward any non-ACP-related mDNS messages to maintain prior
non-ACP mDNS functionality. Adding support for ACP to such L2 switches
with mDNS could therefore create regression problems for prior mDNS
functionality on those nodes. With low performance of software
forwarding in many L2 switches, this could also make the ACP risky to
support on such L2 switches.[¶](#section-a.3.2-1){.pilcrow}

LLDP was not considered because of the above mentioned issues. mDNS was
not selected because of the above L2 mDNS considerations and because of
the following additional points.[¶](#section-a.3.3-1){.pilcrow}

If mDNS was not already existing in a node, it would be more work to
implement than DULL GRASP, and if an existing implementation of mDNS was
used, it would likely be more code space than a separate implementation
of DULL GRASP or a shared implementation of DULL GRASP and GRASP in the
ACP.[¶](#section-a.3.3-2){.pilcrow}

## [A.4.](#section-a.4){.section-number .selfRef} [Choice of Routing Protocol (RPL)](#name-choice-of-routing-protocol-){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-choice-of-routing-protocol-}

This section motivates why RPL (\"IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power
and Lossy Networks \[[RFC6550](#RFC6550){.xref}\]) was chosen as the
default (and in this specification only) routing protocol for the ACP.
The choice and above explained profile were derived from a pre-standard
implementation of ACP that was successfully deployed in operational
networks.[¶](#section-a.4-1){.pilcrow}

The requirements for routing in the ACP are the
following:[¶](#section-a.4-2){.pilcrow}

-   [Self-management: the ACP must build automatically, without human
    intervention. Therefore, the routing protocol must also work
    completely automatically. RPL is a simple, self-managing protocol,
    which does not require zones or areas; it is also self-configuring,
    since configuration is carried as part of the protocol (see [Section
    6.7.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6550#section-6.7.6){.relref}
    of
    \[[RFC6550](#RFC6550){.xref}\]).[¶](#section-a.4-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-a.4-3.1}

-   [Scale: the ACP builds over an entire domain, which could be a large
    enterprise or service provider network. The routing protocol must
    therefore support domains of 100,000 nodes or more, ideally without
    the need for zoning or separation into areas. RPL has this scale
    property. This is based on extensive use of default
    routing.[¶](#section-a.4-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-a.4-3.2}

-   [Low resource consumption: the ACP supports traditional network
    infrastructure, thus runs in addition to traditional protocols. The
    ACP, and specifically the routing protocol, must have low resource
    consumption requirements, both in terms of memory and CPU.
    Specifically, at edge nodes, where memory and CPU are scarce,
    consumption should be minimal. RPL builds a DODAG, where the main
    resource consumption is at the root of the DODAG. The closer to the
    edge of the network, the less state needs to be maintained. This
    adapts nicely to the typical network design. Also, all changes below
    a common parent node are kept below that parent
    node.[¶](#section-a.4-3.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-a.4-3.3}

-   [Support for unstructured address space: in the ANI, node addresses
    are identifiers, they and may not be assigned in a topological way.
    Also, nodes may move topologically, without changing their address.
    Therefore, the routing protocol must support completely unstructured
    address space. RPL is specifically made for mobile, ad hoc networks,
    with no assumptions on topologically aligned
    addressing.[¶](#section-a.4-3.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-a.4-3.4}

-   [Modularity: to keep the initial implementation small, yet allow for
    more complex methods later, it is highly desirable that the routing
    protocol has a simple base functionality, but can import new
    functional modules if needed. RPL has this property with the concept
    of \"Objective Function\", which is a plugin to modify routing
    behavior.[¶](#section-a.4-3.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-a.4-3.5}

-   ::: {#section-a.4-3.6}
    ::: {#extens .normal}
    Extensibility: since the ANI is a new concept, it is likely that
    changes to the way of operation will happen over time. RPL allows
    for new Objective Functions to be introduced later, which allow
    changes to the way the routing protocol creates the
    DAGs.[¶](#extens){.pilcrow}
    :::
    :::

-   [Multi-topology support: it may become necessary in the future to
    support more than one DODAG for different purposes, using different
    Objective Functions. RPL allow for the creation of several parallel
    DODAGs should this be required. This could be used to create
    different topologies to reach different
    roots.[¶](#section-a.4-3.7){.pilcrow}]{#section-a.4-3.7}

-   [No need for path optimization: RPL does not necessarily compute the
    optimal path between any two nodes. However, the ACP does not
    require this today, since it carries mainly delay-insensitive
    feedback loops. It is possible that different optimization schemes
    will become necessary in the future, but RPL can be expanded (see
    [\"Extensibility\"](#extens){.xref}

## [A.5.](#section-a.5){.section-number .selfRef} [ACP Information Distribution and Multicast](#name-acp-information-distributio){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-acp-information-distributio}

IP multicast is not used by the ACP because the ANI itself does not
require IP multicast but only service announcement/discovery. Using IP
multicast for that would have made it necessary to develop a zero-touch
autoconfiguring solution for ASM (Any Source Multicast - the original
form of IP multicast defined in \"[Host extensions for IP
multicasting](#RFC1112){.xref}\" \[[RFC1112](#RFC1112){.xref}\]), which
would be quite complex and difficult to justify. One aspect of
complexity where no attempt at a solution has been described in IETF
documents is the automatic selection of routers that should be PIM
Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) Rendezvous Points (RPs) (see \"[Protocol
Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM): Protocol Specification
(Revised)](#RFC7761){.xref}\" \[[RFC7761](#RFC7761){.xref}\]). The other
aspects of complexity are the implementation of MLD (\"[Using Internet
Group Management Protocol Version 3 (IGMPv3) and Multicast Listener
Discovery Protocol Version 2 (MLDv2) for Source-Specific
Multicast](#RFC4604){.xref}\" \[[RFC4604](#RFC4604){.xref}\]), PIM-SM,
and Anycast-RP (see \"[Anycast-RP Using Protocol Independent Multicast
(PIM)](#RFC4610){.xref}\" \[[RFC4610](#RFC4610){.xref}\]). If those
implementations already exist in a product, then they would be very
likely tied to accelerated forwarding, which consumes hardware
resources, and that in turn is difficult to justify as a cost of
performing only service discovery.[¶](#section-a.5-1){.pilcrow}

Some future ASA may need high-performance, in-network data replication.
That is the case when the use of IP multicast is justified. Such an ASA
can then use service discovery from ACP GRASP, and then they do not need
ASM but only SSM (see \"[Source-Specific Multicast for
IP](#RFC4607){.xref}\" \[[RFC4607](#RFC4607){.xref}\]) for the IP
multicast replication. SSM itself can simply be enabled in the data
plane (or even in an update to the ACP) without any configuration other
than just enabling it on all nodes, and it only requires a simpler
version of MLD (see \"[Lightweight Internet Group Management Protocol
Version 3 (IGMPv3) and Multicast Listener Discovery Version 2 (MLDv2)
Protocols](#RFC5790){.xref}\"
\[[RFC5790](#RFC5790){.xref}\]).[¶](#section-a.5-2){.pilcrow}

IGP routing protocols based on LSP (Link State Protocol) typically have
a mechanism to flood information, and such a mechanism could be used to
flood GRASP objectives by defining them to be information of that IGP.
This would be a possible optimization in future variations of the ACP
that do use an LSP-based routing protocol. Note though that such a
mechanism would not work easily for GRASP M_DISCOVERY messages, which
are intelligently (constrained) flooded not across the whole ACP, but
only up to a node where a responder is found. We expect that many future
services in the ASA will have only a few consuming ASAs, and for those
cases, the M_DISCOVERY method is more efficient than flooding across the
whole domain.[¶](#section-a.5-3){.pilcrow}

Because the ACP uses RPL, one desirable future extension is to use
RPL\'s existing notion of DODAG, which are loop-free distribution trees,
to make GRASP flooding more efficient both for M_FLOOD and M_DISCOVERY.
See [Section 6.13.5](#ACP_interfaces){.xref} for how this will be
specifically beneficial when using NBMA interfaces. This is not
currently specified in this document because it is not quite clear yet
what exactly the implications are to make GRASP flooding depend on RPL
DODAG convergence and how difficult it would be to let GRASP flooding
access the DODAG information.[¶](#section-a.5-4){.pilcrow}

## [A.6.](#section-a.6){.section-number .selfRef} [CAs, Domains, and Routing Subdomains](#name-cas-domains-and-routing-sub){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-cas-domains-and-routing-sub}

There is a wide range of setting up different ACP solutions by
appropriately using CAs and the domain and rsub elements in the
acp-node-name in the domain certificate. We summarize these options here
as they have been explained in different parts of the document and
discuss possible and desirable extensions.[¶](#section-a.6-1){.pilcrow}

An ACP domain is the set of all ACP nodes that can authenticate each
other as belonging to the same ACP network using the ACP domain
membership check ([Section 6.2.3](#certcheck){.xref}). GRASP inside the
ACP is run across all transitively connected ACP nodes in a
domain.[¶](#section-a.6-2){.pilcrow}

The rsub element in the acp-node-name permits the use of addresses from
different ULA prefixes. One use case is the creation of multiple
physical networks that initially may be separated with one ACP domain
but different routing subdomains, so that all nodes can mutually trust
their ACP certificates (not depending on rsub) and so that they could
connect later together into a contiguous ACP
network.[¶](#section-a.6-3){.pilcrow}

One instance of such a use case is an ACP for regions interconnected via
a non-ACP enabled core, for example, due to the absence of product
support for ACP on the core nodes. ACP connect configurations as defined
in this document can be used to extend and interconnect those ACP
islands to the NOC and merge them into a single ACP when later that
product support gap is closed.[¶](#section-a.6-4){.pilcrow}

Note that RPL scales very well. It is not necessary to use multiple
routing subdomains to scale ACP domains in a way that would be required
if other routing protocols where used. They exist only as options for
the above mentioned reasons.[¶](#section-a.6-5){.pilcrow}

If ACP domains need to be created that are not allowed to connect to
each other by default, simply use different domain elements in the
acp-node-name. These domain elements can be arbitrary, including
subdomains of one another: domains \"example.com\" and
\"research.example.com\" are separate domains if both are domain
elements in the acp-node-name of
certificates.[¶](#section-a.6-6){.pilcrow}

It is not necessary to have a separate CA for different ACP domains: an
operator can use a single CA to sign certificates for multiple ACP
domains that are not allowed to connect to each other because the checks
for ACP adjacencies include the comparison of the domain
part.[¶](#section-a.6-7){.pilcrow}

If multiple, independent networks chose the same domain name but had
their own CAs, these would not form a single ACP domain because of CA
mismatch. Therefore, there is no problem in choosing domain names that
are potentially also used by others. Nevertheless, it is highly
recommended to use domain names that have a high probability of being
unique. It is recommended to use domain names that start with a DNS
domain name owned by the assigning organization and unique within it,
for example, \"acp.example.com\" if you own
\"example.com\".[¶](#section-a.6-8){.pilcrow}

## [A.7.](#section-a.7){.section-number .selfRef} [Intent for the ACP](#name-intent-for-the-acp){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-intent-for-the-acp}

Intent is the architecture component of Autonomic Networks according to
\[[RFC8993](#RFC8993){.xref}\] that allows operators to issue policies
to the network. Its applicability for use is quite flexible and
freeform, with potential applications including policies flooded across
ACP GRASP and interpreted on every ACP
node.[¶](#section-a.7-1){.pilcrow}

One concern for future definitions of Intent solutions is the problem of
circular dependencies when expressing Intent policies about the ACP
itself.[¶](#section-a.7-2){.pilcrow}

For example, Intent could indicate the desire to build an ACP across all
domains that have a common parent domain (without relying on the
rsub/routing-subdomain solution defined in this document): ACP nodes
with the domains \"example.com\", \"access.example.com\",
\"core.example.com\", and \"city.core.example.com\" should all establish
one single ACP.[¶](#section-a.7-3){.pilcrow}

If each domain has its own source of Intent, then the Intent would
simply have to allow adding the peer domain\'s TA and domain names to
the parameters for the ACP domain membership check ([Section
6.2.3](#certcheck){.xref}) so that nodes from those other domains are
accepted as ACP peers.[¶](#section-a.7-4){.pilcrow}

If this Intent was to be originated only from one domain, it could
likely not be made to work because the other domains will not build any
ACP connections amongst each other, whether they use the same or
different CA due to the ACP domain membership
check.[¶](#section-a.7-5){.pilcrow}

If the domains use the same CA, one could change the ACP setup to permit
the ACP to be established between two ACP nodes with different
acp-domain-names, but only for the purpose of disseminating limited
information, such as Intent, but not to set up full ACP connectivity,
specifically not RPL routing and passing of arbitrary GRASP information,
unless the Intent policies permit this to happen across domain
boundaries.[¶](#section-a.7-6){.pilcrow}

This type of approach, where the ACP first allows Intent to operate and
only then sets up the rest of ACP connectivity based on Intent policy,
could also be used to enable Intent policies that would limit
functionality across the ACP inside a domain, as long as no policy would
disturb the distribution of Intent, for example, to limit reachability
across the ACP to certain types of nodes or locations of
nodes.[¶](#section-a.7-7){.pilcrow}

The ACP as specified in this document is very explicit about the choice
of options to allow interoperable implementations. The choices made may
not be the best for all environments, but the concepts used by the ACP
can be used to build derived solutions.[¶](#section-a.8-1){.pilcrow}

The ACP specifies the use of ULA and the derivation of its prefix from
the domain name so that no address allocation is required to deploy the
ACP. The ACP will equally work using any other /48 IPv6 prefix and not
ULA. This prefix could simply be a configuration of the ACP registrars
(for example, when using BRSKI) to enroll the domain certificates,
instead of the ACP registrar deriving the /48 ULA prefix from the AN
domain name.[¶](#section-a.8-2){.pilcrow}

Some solutions may already have an auto-addressing scheme, for example,
derived from existing, unique device identifiers (e.g., MAC addresses).
In those cases, it may not be desirable to assign addresses to devices
via the ACP address information field in the way described in this
document. The certificate may simply serve to identify the ACP domain,
and the address field could be omitted. The only fix required in the
remaining way the ACP operates is to define another element in the
domain certificate for the two peers to decide who is the Decider and
who is the Follower during secure channel building. Note though that
future work may leverage the ACP address to authenticate \"ownership\"
of the address by the device. If the ACP address used by a device is
derived from some preexisting, permanent local ID (such as MAC address),
then it would be useful to store that local ID also in the
certificate.[¶](#section-a.8-3){.pilcrow}

The ACP is defined as a separate VRF because it intends to support
well-managed networks with a wide variety of configurations. Therefore,
reliable, configuration-indestructible connectivity cannot be achieved
from the data plane itself. In solutions where all functions that impact
transit connectivity are fully automated (including security),
indestructible, and resilient, it would be possible to eliminate the
need for the ACP to be a separate VRF. Consider the most simple example
system in which there is no separate data plane, but the ACP is the data
plane. Add BRSKI, and it becomes a fully Autonomic Network \-- except
that it does not support automatic addressing for user equipment. This
gap can then be closed, for example, by adding a solution derived from
\"[Autonomic IPv6 Edge Prefix Management in Large-Scale
Networks](#RFC8992){.xref}\"
\[[RFC8992](#RFC8992){.xref}\].[¶](#section-a.8-4){.pilcrow}

TCP/TLS as the protocols to provide reliability and security to GRASP in
the ACP may not be the preferred choice in constrained networks. For
example, CoAP/DTLS (Constrained Application Protocol) may be preferred
where they are already used, which would reduce the additional code
space footprint for the ACP on those devices. Hop-by-hop reliability for
ACP GRASP messages could be made to support protocols like DTLS by
adding the same type of negotiation as defined in this document for ACP
secure channel protocol negotiation. In future ACP extensions meant to
better support constrained devices, end-to-end GRASP connections can be
made to select their transport protocol by indicating the supported
transport protocols (e.g. TLS/DTLS) via GRASP parameters of the GRASP
objective through which the transport endpoint is
discovered.[¶](#section-a.8-5){.pilcrow}

RPL, the routing protocol used for the ACP, explicitly does not optimize
for shortest paths and fastest convergence. Variations of the ACP may
want to use a different routing protocol or introduce more advanced RPL
profiles.[¶](#section-a.8-6){.pilcrow}

Variations such as which routing protocol to use, or whether to
instantiate an ACP in a VRF or (as suggested above) as the actual data
plane, can be automatically chosen in implementations built to support
multiple options by deriving them from future parameters in the
certificate. Parameters in certificates should be limited to those that
would not need to be changed more often than that certificates would
need to be updated, or it should be ensured that these parameters can be
provisioned before the variation of an ACP is activated in a node. Using
BRSKI, this could be done, for example, as additional follow-up
signaling directly after the certificate enrollment, still leveraging
the BRSKI TLS connection and therefore not introducing any additional
connectivity requirements.[¶](#section-a.8-7){.pilcrow}

Last but not least, secure channel protocols including their
encapsulations are easily added to ACP solutions. ACP hop-by-hop
network-layer secure channels could also be replaced by end-to-end
security plus other means for infrastructure protection. Any future
network OAM should always use end-to-end security. By leveraging the
domain certificates, it would not be dependent on security provided by
ACP secure channels.[¶](#section-a.8-8){.pilcrow}

Routing in the ACP according to this specification only leverages the
standard RPL mechanism of route optimization, e.g., keeping only the
routes that are not towards the RPL root. This is known to scale to
networks with 20,000 or more nodes. There is no auto-aggregation of
routes for /48 ULA prefixes (when using rsub in the acp-node-name)
and/or Zone-ID based prefixes.[¶](#section-a.9.1-1){.pilcrow}

Automatic assignment of Zone-ID and auto-aggregation of routes could be
achieved, for example, by configuring zone boundaries, announcing via
GRASP into the zones the zone parameters (Zone-ID and /48 ULA prefix),
and auto-aggregating routes on the zone boundaries. Nodes would assign
their Zone-ID and potentially even the /48 prefix based on the GRASP
announcements.[¶](#section-a.9.1-2){.pilcrow}

As described in [Section 6.13.2](#general_addressing){.xref}, the ACP
depends on the data plane to establish IPv6 link-local addressing on
interfaces. Using a separate MAC address for the ACP allows the full
isolation of the ACP from the data plane in a way that is compatible
with this specification. It is also an ideal option when using
single-root input/output virtualization (SR-IOV, see
\[[SR](#SR){.xref}\]) in an implementation to isolate the ACP because
different SR-IOV interfaces use different MAC
addresses.[¶](#section-a.9.2-1){.pilcrow}

When additional MAC address(es) are not available, separation of the ACP
could be done at different demux points. The same subnet interface could
have a separate IPv6 interface for the ACP and data plane and therefore
separate link-local addresses for both, where the ACP interface is not
configurable on the data plane. This too would be compatible with this
specification and not impact
interoperability.[¶](#section-a.9.2-2){.pilcrow}

An option that would require additional specification is to use a
different Ethertype from 0x86DD (IPv6) to encapsulate IPv6 packets for
the ACP. This would be a similar approach as used for IP authentication
packets in \[[IEEE-802.1X](#IEEE-802.1X){.xref}\], which uses the
Extensible Authentication Protocol over Local Area Network (EAPoL)
Ethertype (0x88A2).[¶](#section-a.9.2-3){.pilcrow}

equally apply to the encapsulation of BRSKI packets including GRASP used

[Figure 17](#figure-17){.selfRef}: [Dual NOC](#name-dual-noc){.selfRef}
:::

The profile for RPL specified in this document builds only one
spanning-tree path set to a root, typically a registrar in one NOC. In
the presence of multiple NOCs, routing toward the non-root NOCs may be
suboptimal. [Figure 17](#dual-noc){.xref} shows an extreme example.
Assuming that node ACP1 becomes the RPL root, traffic between ACP11 and
NOC2 will pass through ACP4-ACP3-ACP1-ACP2 instead of ACP4-ACP2 because
the RPL-calculated DODAG and routes are shortest paths towards the RPL
root.[¶](#section-a.9.4-2){.pilcrow}

To overcome these limitations, extensions and/or modifications to the
RPL profile can optimize for multiple NOCs. This requires utilizing data
plane artifacts, including IP-in-IP encapsulation/decapsulation on ACP
routers and processing of IPv6 RPI headers. Alternatively, (Src,Dst)
routing table entries could be used.[¶](#section-a.9.4-3){.pilcrow}

Flooding of ACP GRASP messages can be further constrained and therefore
optimized by flooding only via links that are part of the RPL
DODAG.[¶](#section-a.9.4-4){.pilcrow}

ACP connect is an explicit mechanism to \"leak\" ACP traffic explicitly
(for example, in a NOC). It is therefore also a possible security gap
when it is easy to enable ACP connect on arbitrary compromised ACP
nodes.[¶](#section-a.9.5-1){.pilcrow}

One simple solution is to define an extension in the ACP certificate\'s
ACP information field indicating the permission for ACP connect to be
configured on that ACP node. This could similarly be done to decide
whether a node is permitted to be a registrar or
not.[¶](#section-a.9.5-2){.pilcrow}

Tying the permitted \"roles\" of an ACP node to the ACP certificate
provides fairly strong protection against misconfiguration, but it is
still subject to code modifications.[¶](#section-a.9.5-3){.pilcrow}

Another interesting role to assign to certificates is that of a NOC
node. This would allow the limiting of certain types of connections,
such as OAM TLS connections to only the NOC initiators or

### [A.9.8.](#section-a.9.8){.section-number .selfRef} [Avoiding and Dealing with Compromised ACP Nodes](#name-avoiding-and-dealing-with-c){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-avoiding-and-dealing-with-c}

Compromised ACP nodes pose the biggest risk to the operations of the
network. The most common types of compromise are the leakage of
credentials to manage and/or configure the device and the application of
malicious configuration, including the change of access credentials, but
not the change of software. Most of today\'s networking equipment should
have secure boot/software infrastructure anyhow, so attacks that
introduce malicious software should be a lot
harder.[¶](#section-a.9.8-1){.pilcrow}

The most important aspect of security design against these types of
attacks is to eliminate password-based configuration access methods and
instead rely on certificate-based credentials handed out only to nodes
where it is clear that the private keys cannot leak. This limits
unexpected propagation of credentials.[¶](#section-a.9.8-2){.pilcrow}

If password-based credentials to configure devices still need to be
supported, they must not be locally configurable, but only be remotely
provisioned or verified (through protocols like RADIUS or Diameter), and
there must be no local configuration permitting the change of these
authentication mechanisms, but ideally they should be autoconfiguring
across the ACP. See
\[[NOC-AUTOCONFIG](#I-D.eckert-anima-noc-autoconfig){.xref}\].[¶](#section-a.9.8-3){.pilcrow}

Without physical access to the compromised device, attackers with access
to configuration should not be able to break the ACP connectivity, even
when they can break or otherwise manipulate (spoof) the data plane
connectivity through configuration. To achieve this, it is necessary to
avoid providing configuration options for the ACP, such as
enabling/disabling it on interfaces. For example, there could be an ACP
configuration that locks down the current ACP configuration unless
factory reset is done.[¶](#section-a.9.8-4){.pilcrow}

With such means, the valid administration has the best chances to
maintain access to ACP nodes, to discover malicious configuration though
ongoing configuration tracking from central locations, for example, and
to react accordingly.[¶](#section-a.9.8-5){.pilcrow}

The primary reaction is to withdraw or change credentials, terminate
malicious existing management sessions, and fix the configuration.
Ensuring that management sessions using invalidated credentials are
terminated automatically without recourse will likely require new
work.[¶](#section-a.9.8-6){.pilcrow}

Only when these steps are infeasible, would it be necessary to revoke or
expire the ACP certificate credentials and consider the node kicked off
the network until the situation can be further rectified, likely
requiring direct physical access to the
node.[¶](#section-a.9.8-7){.pilcrow}

Without extensions, compromised ACP nodes can only be removed from the
ACP at the speed of CRL/OCSP information refresh or expiry (and
non-removal) of short-lived certificates. Future extensions to the ACP
could, for example, use the GRASP flooding distribution of triggered
updates of CRL/OCSP or the explicit removal indication of the
compromised node\'s domain certificate.[¶](#section-a.9.8-8){.pilcrow}

The following text proposes a mechanism to protect against downgrade
attacks without introducing a new specialized GRASP secure channel
mechanism. Instead, it relies on running GRASP after establishing a
secure channel protocol to verify if the established secure channel
option could have been the result of a MITM downgrade
attack.[¶](#section-a.9.9-1){.pilcrow}

MITM attackers can force downgrade attacks for ACP secure channel
selection by filtering and/or modifying DULL GRASP messages and/or
actual secure channel data packets. For example, if at some point in
time, DTLS traffic could be more easily decrypted than traffic of IKEv2,
the MITM could filter all IKEv2 packets to force ACP nodes to use DTLS
(assuming that the ACP nodes in question supported both DTLS and
IKEv2).[¶](#section-a.9.9-2){.pilcrow}

For cases where such MITM attacks are not capable of injecting malicious
traffic (but only of decrypting the traffic), a downgrade attack could
be discovered after a secure channel connection is established, for
example, by using the following type of
mechanism.[¶](#section-a.9.9-3){.pilcrow}

After the secure channel connection is established, the two ACP peers
negotiate, via an appropriate (to be defined) GRASP negotiation, which
ACP secure channel protocol should have been selected between them (in
the absence of a MITM attacker). This negotiation would signal the ACP
secure channel options announced by DULL GRASP by each peer followed by
an announcement of the preferred secure channel protocol by the ACP peer
that is the Decider in the secure channel setup, i.e., the ACP peer that
decides which secure channel protocol to use. If that chosen secure
channel protocol is different from the one that actually was chosen,
then this mismatch is an indication that there is a MITM attacker or
other similar issue (e.g., a firewall prohibiting the use of specific
protocols) that caused a non-preferred secure channel protocol to be
chosen. This discovery could then result in mitigation options such as
logging and ensuing investigations.[¶](#section-a.9.9-4){.pilcrow}
