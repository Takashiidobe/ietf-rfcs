[JMAP for Mail](#RFC8621){.xref} \[[RFC8621](#RFC8621){.xref}\] is a
JSON-based application protocol for synchronizing email data between a
client and a server.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

This document describes an extension to JMAP for returning the S/MIME
signature verification status \[[RFC8551](#RFC8551){.xref}\], without
requiring a JMAP client to download the signature body part and all
signed body parts (when the multipart/signed media type
\[[RFC1847](#RFC1847){.xref}\] is used) or to download and decode the
Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) (when the application/pkcs7-mime
media type ([Section
3.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8551#section-3.2){.relref} of
\[[RFC8551](#RFC8551){.xref}\]) is used). The use of the extension
implies the client trusts the JMAP server\'s S/MIME signature
verification code and configuration. This extension is suitable for
cases where reduction in network bandwidth and client-side code
complexity outweigh security concerns about trusting the JMAP server to
perform S/MIME signature verifications. One possible use case is when
the same organization controls both the JMAP server and the JMAP
client.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC8621](#RFC8621){.xref}\] defines the Email/get method for
retrieving message-specific information. This document defines the
following pseudo values in the *properties*
argument:[¶](#section-4.1-1){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

**smimeStatus**:
:   If \"smimeStatus\" is included in the list of requested properties,
    it [MUST]{.bcp14} be interpreted by the server as a request to
    return the \"smimeStatus\" response
    property.[¶](#section-4.1-2.2){.pilcrow}
:   

**smimeStatusAtDelivery**:
:   If \"smimeStatusAtDelivery\" is included in the list of requested
    properties, it [MUST]{.bcp14} be interpreted by the server as a
    request to return the \"smimeStatusAtDelivery\" response property.
    (It is effectively the same as the \"smimeStatus\" value calculated
    at the date/time of delivery, as specified by
    \"receivedAt\".)[¶](#section-4.1-2.4){.pilcrow}
:   

**smimeErrors**:
:   If \"smimeErrors\" is included in the list of requested properties,
    it [MUST]{.bcp14} be interpreted by the server as a request to
    return the \"smimeErrors\" response
    property.[¶](#section-4.1-2.6){.pilcrow}
:   

**smimeVerifiedAt**:
:   If \"smimeVerifiedAt\" is included in the list of requested
    properties, it [MUST]{.bcp14} be interpreted by the server as a
    request to return the \"smimeVerifiedAt\" response
    property.[¶](#section-4.1-2.8){.pilcrow}
:   

The \"smimeStatus\" response property is defined as
follows:[¶](#section-4.1-3){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

**smimeStatus**:

:   \"String\|null\" (server-set). null signifies that the message
    doesn\'t contain any signature. Otherwise, this property contains
    the S/MIME signature and certificate verification status calculated
    according to \[[RFC8551](#RFC8551){.xref}\],
    \[[RFC8550](#RFC8550){.xref}\], and \[[RFC5280](#RFC5280){.xref}\].
    Possible string values of the property are listed below. Servers
    [MAY]{.bcp14} return other values not defined below, as defined in
    extensions to this document. Clients [MUST]{.bcp14} treat
    unrecognized values as \"unknown\" or \"signed/failed\". Note that
    the value of this property might change over
    time.[¶](#section-4.1-4.2.1){.pilcrow}

    []{.break}

    unknown:
    :   An S/MIME message, but it was neither signed nor encrypted. This
        can also be returned for a multipart/signed message that
        contains an unrecognized signing protocol (for example,
        OpenPGP).[¶](#section-4.1-4.2.2.2){.pilcrow}
    :   

    signed:
    :   An S/MIME signed message, but the signature was not yet
        verified. Some servers might not attempt to verify a signature
        until a particular message is requested by the client. (This is
        a useful optimization for a JMAP server to avoid doing work
        until exact information is needed. A JMAP client that only needs
        to display an icon that signifies presence of an S/MIME
        signature can still use this value.) JMAP servers compliant with
        this document [SHOULD]{.bcp14} attempt signature verification
        and return \"signed/verified\" or \"signed/failed\" instead of
        this signature status.[¶](#section-4.1-4.2.2.4){.pilcrow}
    :   

    signed/verified:
    :   An S/MIME signed message, and the sender\'s signature was
        successfully verified according to
        \[[RFC8551](#RFC8551){.xref}\] and
        \[[RFC8550](#RFC8550){.xref}\]. Additionally, the signer email
        address extracted from the S/MIME certificate matches the From
        header field value, and the signer certificate [SHOULD]{.bcp14}
        be checked for revocation.[¶](#section-4.1-4.2.2.6){.pilcrow}
    :   

    signed/failed:
    :   S/MIME signed message, but the signature failed to verify
        according to \[[RFC8551](#RFC8551){.xref}\] and
        \[[RFC8550](#RFC8550){.xref}\]. This might be because of a
        policy-related decision (e.g., the message signer email address
        doesn\'t match the From header field value), the message was
        modified, the signer\'s certificate has expired or was revoked,
        etc.[¶](#section-4.1-4.2.2.8){.pilcrow}
    :   

    encrypted+signed/verified:
    :   This value is reserved for future use. It is typically handled
        in the same way as
        \"signed/verified\".[¶](#section-4.1-4.2.2.10){.pilcrow}
    :   

    encrypted+signed/failed:
    :   This value is reserved for future use. It is typically handled
        in the same way as
        \"signed/failed\".[¶](#section-4.1-4.2.2.12){.pilcrow}
    :   

:   

The \"smimeStatusAtDelivery\" response property has the same syntax as
\"smimeStatus\" but is calculated in relationship to the \"receivedAt\"
date/time. Unlike \"smimeStatus\", the \"smimeStatusAtDelivery\"
response property value doesn\'t change unless trust anchors are added.
(For example, addition of a trust anchor can change the value of a
message \"smimeStatusAtDelivery\" property from \"signed/failed\" to
\"signed/verified\". Note that trust anchor removal doesn\'t affect this
response property.) The \"smimeStatusAtDelivery\" response property
value allows clients to compare the S/MIME signature verification status
at delivery with the current status as returned by \"smimeStatus\", for
example, to help to answer questions like \"was the signature valid at
the time of delivery?\".[¶](#section-4.1-5){.pilcrow}

Note that the \"smimeStatusAtDelivery\" response property value doesn\'t
have to be calculated at delivery time. A JMAP server can defer its
calculation until it is explicitly requested; however, once it is
calculated, its value is remembered for later
use.[¶](#section-4.1-6){.pilcrow}

The \"smimeErrors\" response property is defined as
follows:[¶](#section-4.1-7){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

**smimeErrors**:
:   \"String\[\]\|null\" (server-set). null signifies that the message
    doesn\'t contain any signature or that there were no errors when
    verifying the S/MIME signature. (That is, this property is non-null
    only when the corresponding \"smimeStatus\" response property value
    is \"signed/failed\" or \"encrypted+signed/failed\". Note that
    future extensions to this document can specify other \"smimeStatus\"
    values that can be used with \"smimeErrors\".) Each string in the
    array is a human-readable description (in the language specified in
    the Content-Language header field, if any) of a problem with the
    signature, the signing certificate, or the signing certificate
    chain. (See [Section
    3.8](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8620#section-3.8){.relref} of
    \[[RFC8620](#RFC8620){.xref}\] in regards to how this is affected by
    the language selection.) In one example, the signing certificate
    might be expired and the message From email address might not
    correspond to any of the email addresses in the signing certificate.
    In another example, the certificate might be expired and the JMAP
    server might be unable to retrieve a Certificate Revocation List
    (CRL) for the certificate. In both of these cases, there would be 2
    elements in the array.[¶](#section-4.1-8.2){.pilcrow}
:   

The \"smimeVerifiedAt\" response property is defined as
follows:[¶](#section-4.1-9){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

**smimeVerifiedAt**:
:   \"UTCDate\|null\" (server-set). null signifies that the message
    doesn\'t contain any S/MIME signature or that there is a signature,
    but there was no attempt to verify it. (Retrieval of the
    \"smimeStatus\" value can be used to distinguish these 2 cases). In
    all other cases, it is set to the date and time of when the S/MIME
    signature was most recently verified. Note that a request to fetch
    \"smimeStatus\", \"smimeStatusAtDelivery\", and/or \"smimeErrors\"
    would force this response property to be set to a non-null value if
    an S/MIME signature exists.[¶](#section-4.1-10.2){.pilcrow}
:   

The \"smimeStatus\" and \"smimeErrors\" values are calculated at the
time the corresponding JMAP request is processed (but see below about
the effect of result caching), not at the time when the message is
generated (according to its Date header field value). In all cases,
\"smimeVerifiedAt\" is set to the time when \"smimeStatus\" and
\"smimeErrors\" were last updated. As recalculating these values is
expensive for the server, they [MAY]{.bcp14} be cached for up to 24
hours from the moment when they were
calculated.[¶](#section-4.1-11){.pilcrow}

Example 1: Retrieval of minimal information about a message, including
its From, Subject, and Date header fields, as well as the S/MIME
signature verification status at delivery and date/time when the message
was received.[¶](#section-4.1-12){.pilcrow}

Future extensions to this document can specify extra allowed values for
the \"smimeStatus\" response property. All values (defined in this
document or in extensions to this document) [MUST]{.bcp14} be in ASCII.
(Note that this response property contains tokens; thus, it is not
subject to internationalization or
localization).[¶](#section-4.1.1-1){.pilcrow}

New \"smimeStatus\" response property values defined in extensions may
affect the behavior of properties, such as the \"smimeErrors\" response
property of Email/get (see [Section 4.1](#email-get-ext){.xref}) or the
\"hasVerifiedSmime\" property of Email/query (see [Section
4.2](#email-query-ext){.xref}). In particular, the new values can be
treated similarly to values defined in this
document.[¶](#section-4.1.1-2){.pilcrow}

For example, a putative JMAP extension for automatically decrypting
S/MIME messages can specify two additional values, one specifying that a
message is both encrypted and signed with a valid S/MIME signature (e.g.
\"encrypted+signed/verified\") and another one specifying that a message
is both encrypted and signed with an invalid S/MIME signature (e.g.
\"encrypted+signed/failed\"). The former value can be treated as
\"signed/verified\" (and would thus affect \"hasVerifiedSmime\") and the
latter can be treated as \"signed/failed\" (and thus can be used with
\"smimeErrors\").[¶](#section-4.1.1-3){.pilcrow}

the following properties of the **FilterCondition**

**hasSmime**:
:   \"Boolean\". If \"hasSmime\" has the value true, only messages with
    \"smimeStatus\" other than null match the condition. If \"hasSmime\"
    has the value false, only messages with \"smimeStatus\" equal to
    null match the condition.[¶](#section-4.2-2.2){.pilcrow}

**hasVerifiedSmime**:

:   \"Boolean\". If \"hasVerifiedSmime\" has the value true, only
    messages with \"smimeStatus\" equal to \"signed/verified\" or
    \"encrypted+signed/verified\" (\*) match the condition. If
    \"hasVerifiedSmime\" has the value false, only messages with
    \"smimeStatus\" not equal to \"signed/verified\" and not equal to
    \"encrypted+signed/verified\" (\*) (including the value null) match
    the condition. Note that use of this attribute is potentially
    expensive for a JMAP server, as it forces calculation of the
    \"smimeStatus\" property value for each message. However, caching of
    the \"smimeStatus\" values should ameliorate this cost
    somewhat.[¶](#section-4.2-2.4.1){.pilcrow}

**hasVerifiedSmimeAtDelivery**:
:   \"Boolean\". The \"hasVerifiedSmimeAtDelivery\" property is handled
    similarly to the \"hasVerifiedSmime\" property, but the value of
    \"smimeStatusAtDelivery\" is used instead of \"smimeStatus\" to
    assess whether a particular message matches the
    condition.[¶](#section-4.2-2.6){.pilcrow}

Use of the server-side S/MIME signature verification JMAP extension
requires the client to trust the server signature verification code, the
server configuration, and the server\'s operational practices to perform
S/MIME signature verification, as well as to trust that the channel
between the client and the server is integrity protected. (For example,
if the server is not configured with some trust anchors, some messages
will have the \"signed/failed\" status instead of \"signed/verified\".)
A malicious or compromised server could return a false verification
status to a client. A successful verification could be conveyed to a
client for a forged or altered message. A properly signed message could
be signaled as having a failed signature verification or no signature at
all. In the case of the latter attack, no new attack surface is
presented with this extension above what a malicious or compromised
server could already do by stripping or tampering with the S/MIME
information in the message. In the case of the former attack, client
software capable of performing S/MIME signature verification could
detect this attack. Local configuration of the client should determine
if this client-side verification should occur. For clients without local
verification capabilities, such an attack would be difficult to
detect.[¶](#section-6-1){.pilcrow}

Integrity protection of the channel between the client and the server is
provided by use of TLS, as required by the JMAP specification (see
[Section
8.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8620#section-8.1){.relref} of
\[[RFC8620](#RFC8620){.xref}\]).[¶](#section-6-2){.pilcrow}

Constant recalculation of the S/MIME signature status can result in a
denial-of-service condition. For that reason, it is
[RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14} that servers cache results of signature
verification for up to 24 hours.[¶](#section-6-3){.pilcrow}
