The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) holds occasional workshops
designed to consider long-term issues and strategies for the Internet,
and to suggest future directions for the Internet architecture. This
long-term planning function of the IAB is complementary to the ongoing
engineering efforts performed by working groups of the Internet
Engineering Task Force (IETF).[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

The Design Expectations vs. Deployment Reality in Protocol Development
Workshop was convened by the IAB in June 2019. This report summarizes
the workshop\'s significant points of discussion and identifies topics
that may warrant further consideration.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

The background for the workshop was that during the development and
early elaboration phase for a number of protocols, there was a
presumption of specific deployment models. Actual deployments have,
however, often run contrary to these early expectations when economies
of scale, Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack resilience, market
consolidation, or other factors have come into play. These factors can
result in the deployed reality being highly
concentrated.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

This is a serious issue for the Internet, as concentrated, centralized
deployment models present risks to user choice, privacy, and future
protocol evolution.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

On occasion, the differences from the original expectations were almost
immediate, but they also occur after significant time has passed since
the protocol\'s initial development.[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}

Some examples are given below.[¶](#section-1-6){.pilcrow}

-   [Email standards, which presumed many providers running in a largely
    uncoordinated fashion but have seen both significant market
    consolidation and a need for coordination to defend against spam and
    other attacks. The coordination and centralized defense mechanisms
    scale better for large entities; these have fueled additional
    consolidation.[¶](#section-1-7.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-7.1}
-   [The Domain Name System (DNS), which presumed deep hierarchies but
    has often been deployed in large, flat zones, leading to the
    nameservers for those zones becoming critical infrastructure. Future
    developments in DNS may see concentration through the use of
    globally available common resolver services, which evolve rapidly
    and can offer better security. Paradoxically, concentration of these
    queries into a few services creates new security and privacy
    concerns.[¶](#section-1-7.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-7.2}
-   [The Web, which is built on a fundamentally decentralized design but
    is now often delivered with the aid of Content Delivery Networks
    (CDNs). Their services provide scaling, distribution, and prevention
    of denial of service in ways that new entrants and smaller systems
    operators would find difficult to replicate. While truly small
    services and truly large services may each operate using only their
    own infrastructure, many others are left with the only practical
    choice being the use of a globally available commercial
    service.[¶](#section-1-7.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-7.3}

Similar developments may happen with future technologies and services.
For instance, the growing use of Machine Learning technology presents
challenges for distributing effective implementation of a service
throughout a pool of many different
providers.[¶](#section-1-8){.pilcrow}

In \[[RFC5218](#RFC5218){.xref}\], the IAB tackled what made for a
successful protocol. In \[[RFC8170](#RFC8170){.xref}\], the IAB
described how to handle protocol transitions. The purpose of this
workshop was to explore cases where the initial system design
assumptions turned out to be wrong, looking for patterns in what caused
those assumptions to fail (e.g., concentration due to DDoS resilience)
and in how those failures impact the security, privacy, and
manageability of the resulting deployments.[¶](#section-1-9){.pilcrow}

While the eventual goals might include proposing common remediations for
specific cases of confounded protocol expectations, this workshop and
thus this report focused on identifying
patterns.[¶](#section-1-10){.pilcrow}

The workshop call for papers invited the submission of position papers
that would:[¶](#section-1-11){.pilcrow}

-   [Describe specific cases where systems assumptions during protocol
    development were confounded by later deployment
    conditions.[¶](#section-1-12.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-12.1}
-   [Survey a set of cases to identify common factors in these
    confounded
    expectations.[¶](#section-1-12.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-12.2}
-   [Explore remediations that foster user privacy, security, and
    provider diversity in the face of these
    changes.[¶](#section-1-12.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-12.3}

A total of 21 position papers were received and are listed in [Section
3](#positionpapers){.xref}. On site or remote were 30 participants; they
are listed in [Appendix
A](#participants){.xref}.[¶](#section-1-13){.pilcrow}

The workshop investigated deployment cases from certificate authorities
for web connections (WebPKI) to DNS Security (DNSSEC), from the Border
Gateway Protocol (BGP) to Network Address Translators (NATs), from DNS
resolvers to CDNs, and from Internet of Things (IoT) systems to instant
messaging and social media applications.[¶](#section-4.1-1){.pilcrow}

In many cases, (1) there was a surprise in how technology was deployed,
(2) there was a lack of sufficient adoption, or (3) the business models
associated with chosen technologies were not in favor of broader
interoperability.[¶](#section-4.1-2){.pilcrow}

In general, the protocol designers cannot affect market forces but must
work within them. But there are often competing technical approaches or
features that are tailored for a particular deployment pattern. In some
cases, it is possible to choose whether to support, for instance, a
clear need for an established business, a feature designed to support
collaboration among smaller players, or some kind of disruption through
a more speculative new feature or
technology.[¶](#section-4.1-3){.pilcrow}

Lessons learned include the following:[¶](#section-4.1-4){.pilcrow}

-   [Feedback from those who deploy often comes too
    late.[¶](#section-4.1-5.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.1-5.1}
-   [Building blocks get repurposed in unexpected
    ways.[¶](#section-4.1-5.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.1-5.2}
-   [User communities come in too
    late.[¶](#section-4.1-5.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.1-5.3}
-   [The Web is getting more centralized, and counteracting this trend
    is difficult. It is not necessarily clear what technical path leads
    to distributed markets and decentralized architectures, for
    instance.[¶](#section-4.1-5.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.1-5.4}
-   [There are also many forces that make it easier to pursue
    centralized models than other models. For instance, deployment is
    often easier in a centralized model. And various business and
    regulatory processes work best within a small, well-defined set of
    entities that can interact with each other. This can lead to, for
    instance, regulators preferring a situation with a small number of
    entities that they can talk to, rather than a diverse set of
    providers.[¶](#section-4.1-5.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.1-5.5}
-   [It is important but hard to determine how useful new protocols
    are.[¶](#section-4.1-5.6){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.1-5.6}
-   [It is difficult for the IETF community to interact with other
    communities, e.g., specific business sectors that need new
    technology (such as aviation or healthcare) or

### [4.2.](#section-4.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Principles](#name-principles){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-principles}

Several underlying principles can be observed in the example cases that
were discussed. Deployment failures tend to be associated with cases
where interdependencies make progress difficult and there\'s no major
advantage for early deployment. Despite persistent problems in the
currently used technology, it becomes difficult for the ecosystem to
switch to better technology. For instance, there are a number of areas
where the Internet routing protocol BGP \[[RFC4271](#RFC4271){.xref}\]
is lacking, but there has been only limited success in deploying
significant improvements \-- for instance, in the area of
security.[¶](#section-4.2-1){.pilcrow}

Another principle appears to be first-mover advantage. Several equally
interesting technologies have fared in very different ways, depending on
whether there was an earlier system that provided most of the benefits
of the new system. Again, despite potential problems in an
already-deployed technology, it becomes difficult to deploy improvements
due to a lack of immediate incentives and due to the competing and
already-deployed alternative that is proceeding forward in the
ecosystem. For instance, WebPKI is very widely deployed and used, but
DNSSEC \[[RFC4033](#RFC4033){.xref}\] is not. Is this because of the
earlier commercial adoption of WebPKI, the more complex
interdependencies between systems that wished to deploy DNSSEC, or some
other reason?[¶](#section-4.2-2){.pilcrow}

The definition of \"success\" in \[[RFC5218](#RFC5218){.xref}\] appears
to be part of the problem. The only way to control deployments up front
is to prevent wild success, but wild successes are actually what we
want. And it seems very difficult to predict these
successes.[¶](#section-4.2-3){.pilcrow}

The workshop also discussed the extent to which protocol work even
should be controlled by the IETF, or the IESG. It seems unproductive to
attempt to constrain deployment models, as one can only offer
possibilities but not force anyone to use a particular
possibility.[¶](#section-4.2-4){.pilcrow}

The workshop also discussed different types of deployment patterns on
the Internet:[¶](#section-4.2-5){.pilcrow}

-   [Delivering functionality over the Internet as a web service. The
    Internet is an open and standardized system, but the service on top
    may be closed, essentially running two components of the same
    service provider\'s software against each other over the browser and
    Internet infrastructure. Several large application systems have
    grown in the Internet in this manner, encompassing large amounts of
    functionality and a large fraction of Internet users. This makes it
    easier for web applications to grow by themselves without
    cross-fertilization or
    interoperability.[¶](#section-4.2-6.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.2-6.1}
-   [Delivering concentrated network services that offer the standard
    capabilities of the Internet. Examples in this category include the
    provisioning of some mail services, DNS resolution, and so
    on.[¶](#section-4.2-6.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.2-6.2}

The second case is more interesting for an Internet architecture
discussion. There can, however, be different underlying situations even
in that case. The service may be simply a concentrated way to provide a
commodity service. The market should find a natural equilibrium for such
situations. This may be fine, particularly where the service does not
provide any new underlying advantage to whoever is providing it (in the
form of user data that can be commercialized, for instance, or as
training data for an important Machine Learning
service).[¶](#section-4.2-7){.pilcrow}

Secondly, the service may be an extension beyond standard protocols,
leading to some questions about how well standards and user expectations
match. But those questions could be addressed by better or newer
standards. Thirdly, and potentially most disturbingly, the service may
be provided in this concentrated manner due to business patterns that
make it easier for particular entities to deploy such
services.[¶](#section-4.2-8){.pilcrow}

The group also discussed monocultures, and their negative effect on the
Internet and its stability and resistance to various problems and
attacks.[¶](#section-4.2-9){.pilcrow}

Regulation may affect the Internet businesses as well. Regulation can
exist in multiple forms, based on economic rationale (e.g., competition
law) or other factors. For instance, user privacy is a common regulatory
topic.[¶](#section-4.2-10){.pilcrow}

### [4.3.](#section-4.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Centralized Deployment Models](#name-centralized-deployment-mode){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-centralized-deployment-mode}

Many of the participants have struggled with these trends and their
effect on desirable characteristics of Internet systems, such as
distributed, end-to-end architecture or privacy. Yet, there are many
business and technical drivers causing the Internet architecture to
become further and further centralized.[¶](#section-4.3-1){.pilcrow}

Some observations that were made:[¶](#section-4.3-2){.pilcrow}

-   [When standardizing new technology, the parties involved in the
    effort may think they agree on what the goals are but in reality are
    often surprised in the end. For instance, with DNS (queries) over
    HTTPS (DoH) \[[RFC8484](#RFC8484){.xref}\], there were very
    different aspirations, some around improvements in confidentiality
    of the queries, some around operational and latency improvements to
    DNS operations, and some about shifting business and deployment
    models. The full picture was not clear before the work was
    completed.[¶](#section-4.3-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.3-3.1}
-   [In DNS, DDoS is a practical reality, and only a handful of
    providers can handle the traffic load in these
    attacks.[¶](#section-4.3-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.3-3.2}

The hopeful side of this issue is that there are some potential
answers:[¶](#section-4.3-4){.pilcrow}

-   [DDoS defenses do not have to come through large entities, as
    layered defenses and federation also help
    similarly.[¶](#section-4.3-5.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.3-5.1}
-   [Surveillance state data capture can be fought with data object
    encryption and by not storing all of the data in one
    place.[¶](#section-4.3-5.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.3-5.2}
-   [Web tracking can be combatted by browsers choosing to avoid
    techniques that are sensitive to tracking. Competition in the
    browser market may help drive some of these
    changes.[¶](#section-4.3-5.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.3-5.3}
-   [Open interfaces help guard against the bundling of services in one
    large entity; as long as there are open, well-defined interfaces to
    specific functions, these functions can also be performed by other
    parties.[¶](#section-4.3-5.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.3-5.4}
-   [Commercial surveillance does not seem to be curbed by current
    means. But there are still possibilities, such as stronger
    regulation, data minimization, or browsers acting on behalf of
    users. There are hopeful signs that at least some browsers are
    becoming more aggressive in this regard. But more is
    needed.[¶](#section-4.3-5.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.3-5.5}

One comment made in the workshop was that the Internet community needs
to curb the architectural trend of centralization. Another comment was
that discussing this in the abstract is not as useful as more concrete,
practical actions. For instance, one might imagine different DoH
deployments with widely different implications for privacy or tolerance
of failures. Getting to the specifics of how a particular service can be
made better is important.[¶](#section-4.3-6){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-4.4 .section}
### [4.4.](#section-4.4){.section-number .selfRef} [Security](#name-security){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-security}

This part of the discussion focused on whether in the current state of
the Internet we actually need a new threat
model.[¶](#section-4.4-1){.pilcrow}

Many of the security concerns regarding communications have been
addressed in the past few years, with increasing encryption. However,
issues with trusting endpoints on the other side of the communication
have not been addressed and are becoming more urgent with the advent of
centralized service architectures.[¶](#section-4.4-2){.pilcrow}

Further effort may be needed to minimize centralization, as having only
a few places to tap increases the likelihood of
surveillance.[¶](#section-4.4-3){.pilcrow}

There may be a need to update \[[RFC3552](#RFC3552){.xref}\] and
\[[RFC7258](#RFC7258){.xref}\].[¶](#section-4.4-4){.pilcrow}

The participants in the workshop agreed that a new threat model is
needed and that non-communications-security issues need to be
handled.[¶](#section-4.4-5){.pilcrow}

Other security discussions were focused on IoT systems, algorithm
agility issues, experiences from difficult security upgrades such as
DNSSEC key rollovers, and routing security.[¶](#section-4.4-6){.pilcrow}

The participants cautioned against relying too much on device
manufacturers for security, and being clear on security models and
assumptions. Security is often poorly understood, and the assumptions
about who the system defends against and who it does not are not
clear.[¶](#section-4.4-7){.pilcrow}

### [4.5.](#section-4.5){.section-number .selfRef} [Future](#name-future){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-future}

The workshop turned into a discussion of what actions we can
take:[¶](#section-4.5-1){.pilcrow}

-   [Documenting our
    experiences?[¶](#section-4.5-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.5-2.1}
-   [Providing advice (to the IETF or to
    others)?[¶](#section-4.5-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.5-2.2}
-   [Waiting for the catastrophe that will make people agree to changes?
    The participants of course did not wish for
    this.[¶](#section-4.5-2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.5-2.3}
-   [Work at the IETF?[¶](#section-4.5-2.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.5-2.4}
-   [Technical
    solutions/choices?[¶](#section-4.5-2.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.5-2.5}

The best way for the IETF to do things is through standards; convincing
people through other requests is difficult. The IETF needs
to:[¶](#section-4.5-3){.pilcrow}

-   [Pick pieces that it is responsible
    for.[¶](#section-4.5-4.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.5-4.1}
-   [Be reactive for the rest, be available as an expert in other
    discussions, provide Internet technology knowledge where needed,
    etc.[¶](#section-4.5-4.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.5-4.2}

One key question is what other parties need to be involved in any
discussions. Platform developers (mobile platforms, cloud systems, etc.)
are one such group. Specific technology or business groups (such as
email provider or certificate authority forums) are
another.[¶](#section-4.5-5){.pilcrow}

The workshop also discussed specific technology issues \-- for instance,
around IoT systems. One observation in those systems is that there is no
single model for applications; they vary. There are a lot of different
constraints in different systems and different control points. What is
perhaps most needed today is user control and transparency (for
instance, via Manufacturer Usage Descriptions (MUDs)
\[[RFC8520](#RFC8520){.xref}\]). Another issue is management,
particularly for devices that could be operational for decades. Given
the diversity of IoT systems, it may also make more sense to build
support systems for broader solutions than for specific solutions or
specific protocols.[¶](#section-4.5-6){.pilcrow}

There are also many security issues. While some of them are trivial
(such as default passwords), one should also look forward and be
prepared to have solutions for, say, trust management for long time
scales, or be able to provide data minimization to cut down on the
potential for leakages. And the difficulty of establishing peer-to-peer
security strengthens the need for a central point, which may also be
harmful from a long-term privacy
perspective.[¶](#section-4.5-7){.pilcrow}

### [5.1.](#section-5.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Summary of Discussions](#name-summary-of-discussions){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-summary-of-discussions}

The workshop met in the sunny Finnish countryside and made the
unsurprising observation that technologies sometimes get deployed in
surprising ways. But the consequences of deployment choices can have an
impact on security, privacy, centralized vs. distributed models,
competition, and surveillance. As the IETF community cares deeply about
these aspects, it is worthwhile to spend time on the analysis of these
choices.[¶](#section-5.1-1){.pilcrow}

The prime factor driving deployments is perceived needs; expecting
people to recognize obvious virtues and therefore deploy them is not
likely to work.[¶](#section-5.1-2){.pilcrow}

And the ecosystem is complex, including, for instance, many parties:
different business roles, users, regulators, and so on, and perceptions
of needs and the ability to act depend highly on what party one talks
to.[¶](#section-5.1-3){.pilcrow}

While the workshop discussed actions and advice, there is a critical
question of who these are targeted towards. There is a need to construct
a map of what parties need to perform what
actions.[¶](#section-5.1-4){.pilcrow}

The workshop also made some technical observations. One issue is that
the workshop identified a set of hard issues that affect deployment and
for which we have no good solutions. These issues include, for instance,
dealing with DDoS attacks and how to handle spam. Similarly, a lack of
good solutions for micropayments is one factor behind a lot of the
Internet economy being based on
advertisements.[¶](#section-5.1-5){.pilcrow}

One recent trend is that technology is moving up the stack, e.g., in the
areas of services, transport protocol functionality, security, naming,
and so on. This impacts how easy or hard changes are and who is able to
perform them.[¶](#section-5.1-6){.pilcrow}

It was also noted that interoperability continues to be important, and
we need to explore what new interfaces need standardization \-- this
will enable different deployment models and competition. The prime
factor driving deployments is actual needs; we cannot force anything on
others but can provide solutions for those that need them. Needs and
actions may fall to different parties.[¶](#section-5.1-7){.pilcrow}

The workshop also considered the balancing of user non-involvement and
transparency, as well as choice, relevant threats such as communicating
with malicious endpoints, the role and willingness of browsers in
increasing the ability to defend users\' privacy, and concerns around
centralized control or data storage points.[¶](#section-5.1-8){.pilcrow}

The workshop also discussed specific issues around routing, DoS attacks,
IoT systems, the role of device manufacturers, the DNS, and regulatory
reactions and their possible consequences.[¶](#section-5.1-9){.pilcrow}

The prime conclusion from the workshop was that the topics we discussed
were not completed in the workshop. Much more work is needed. The best
way for the IETF to make an impact is through standards. The IETF should
focus on the parts that it is responsible for and be available as an
expert on other discussions.[¶](#section-5.2-1){.pilcrow}
