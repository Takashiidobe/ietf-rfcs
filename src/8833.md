# RFC 8833 {#rfcnum}

# Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) for WebRTC {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

This document specifies two Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation
(ALPN) labels for use with Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC). The
\"webrtc\" label identifies regular WebRTC: a DTLS session that is used
to establish keys for the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) or
to establish data channels using the Stream Control Transmission
Protocol (SCTP) over DTLS. The \"c-webrtc\" label describes the same
protocol, but the peers also agree to maintain the confidentiality of
the media by not sharing it with other
applications.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

[Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC)](#RFC8825){.xref}
\[[RFC8825](#RFC8825){.xref}\] uses [Datagram Transport Layer Security
(DTLS)](#RFC6347){.xref} \[[RFC6347](#RFC6347){.xref}\] to secure all
peer-to-peer communications.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

Identifying WebRTC protocol usage with [Application-Layer Protocol
Negotiation (ALPN)](#RFC7301){.xref} \[[RFC7301](#RFC7301){.xref}\]
enables an endpoint to positively identify WebRTC uses and distinguish
them from other DTLS uses.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

Different WebRTC uses can be advertised and behavior can be constrained
to what is appropriate to a given use. In particular, this allows for
the identification of sessions that require confidentiality protection
from the application that manages the signaling for the
session.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

## [2.](#section-2){.section-number .selfRef} [ALPN Labels for WebRTC](#name-alpn-labels-for-webrtc){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-alpn-labels-for-webrtc}

The following identifiers are defined for use in
ALPN:[¶](#section-2-1){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

webrtc:
:   The DTLS session is used to establish keys for the Secure Real-time
    Transport Protocol (SRTP) \-- known as DTLS-SRTP \-- as described in
    \[[RFC5764](#RFC5764){.xref}\]. The DTLS record layer is used for
    [WebRTC data channels](#RFC8831){.xref}
    \[[RFC8831](#RFC8831){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2-2.2){.pilcrow}
:   

c-webrtc:
:   The DTLS session is used for confidential WebRTC, where peers agree
    to maintain the confidentiality of the media, as described in
    [Section 3](#confidentiality){.xref}. The confidentiality
    protections ensure that media is protected from other applications,
    but the confidentiality protections do not extend to messages on
    data channels.[¶](#section-2-2.4){.pilcrow}
:   

Both identifiers describe the same basic protocol: a DTLS session that
is used to provide keys for an SRTP session in combination with WebRTC
data channels. Either SRTP or data channels could be absent. The data
channels send the [Stream Control Transmission Protocol
(SCTP)](#RFC4960){.xref} \[[RFC4960](#RFC4960){.xref}\] over the DTLS
record layer, which can be multiplexed with SRTP on the same UDP flow.
WebRTC requires the use of [Interactive Connectivity Establishment
(ICE)](#RFC8445){.xref} \[[RFC8445](#RFC8445){.xref}\] to establish UDP
flow, but this is not covered by the
identifier.[¶](#section-2-3){.pilcrow}

A more thorough definition of what WebRTC entails is included in
\[[RFC8835](#RFC8835){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2-4){.pilcrow}

There is no functional difference between the identifiers except that an
endpoint negotiating `c-webrtc` makes a promise to preserve the
confidentiality of the media it receives.[¶](#section-2-5){.pilcrow}

A peer that is not aware of whether it needs to request confidentiality
can use either identifier. A peer in the client role [MUST]{.bcp14}
offer both identifiers if it is not aware of a need for confidentiality.
A peer in the server role [SHOULD]{.bcp14} select `webrtc` if it does
not prefer either.[¶](#section-2-6){.pilcrow}

An endpoint that requires media confidentiality might negotiate a
session with a peer that does not support this specification. An
endpoint [MUST]{.bcp14} abort a session if it requires confidentiality
but does not successfully negotiate `c-webrtc`. A peer that is willing
to accept `webrtc` [SHOULD]{.bcp14} assume that a peer that does not
support this specification has negotiated `webrtc` unless signaling
provides other information; however, a peer [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} assume
that `c-webrtc` has been negotiated unless explicitly
negotiated.[¶](#section-2-7){.pilcrow}
:::

::: {#confidentiality}
::: {#section-3 .section}
## [3.](#section-3){.section-number .selfRef} [Media Confidentiality](#name-media-confidentiality){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-media-confidentiality}

Private communications in WebRTC depend on separating control (i.e.,
signaling) capabilities and access to media
\[[RFC8827](#RFC8827){.xref}\]. In this way, an application can
establish a session that is end-to-end confidential, where the ends in
question are user agents (or browsers) and not the signaling
application. This allows an application to manage signaling for a
session without having access to the media that is exchanged in the
session.[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

Without some form of indication that is securely bound to the session, a
WebRTC endpoint is unable to properly distinguish between a session that
requires this confidentiality protection and one that does not. The ALPN
identifier provides that signal.[¶](#section-3-2){.pilcrow}

A browser is required to enforce this confidentiality protection using
isolation controls similar to those used in content cross-origin
protections (see the \"Origin\" section of \[[HTML5](#HTML5){.xref}\]).
These protections ensure that media is protected from applications,
which are not able to read or modify the contents of a protected flow of
media. Media that is produced from a session using the `c-webrtc`
identifier [MUST]{.bcp14} only be displayed to
users.[¶](#section-3-3){.pilcrow}

The promise to apply confidentiality protections do not apply to data
that is sent using data channels. Confidential data depends on having
both data sources and consumers that are exclusively browser or user
based. No mechanisms currently exist to take advantage of data
confidentiality, though some use cases suggest that this could be
useful, for example, confidential peer-to-peer file transfer.
Alternative labels might be provided in the future to support these use
cases.[¶](#section-3-4){.pilcrow}

This mechanism explicitly does not define a specific authentication
method; a WebRTC endpoint that accepts a session with this ALPN
identifier [MUST]{.bcp14} respect confidentiality no matter what
identity is attributed to a peer.[¶](#section-3-5){.pilcrow}

RTP middleboxes and entities that forward media or data cannot promise
to maintain confidentiality. Any entity that forwards content, or
records content for later access by entities other than the
authenticated peer, [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} offer or accept a session with
the `c-webrtc` identifier.[¶](#section-3-6){.pilcrow}

## [4.](#section-4){.section-number .selfRef} [Security Considerations](#name-security-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-security-considerations}

Confidential communications depend on more than just an agreement from
browsers.[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

Information is not confidential if it is displayed to others than for
whom it is intended. [Peer authentication](#RFC8827){.xref}
\[[RFC8827](#RFC8827){.xref}\] is necessary to ensure that data is only
sent to the intended peer.[¶](#section-4-2){.pilcrow}

This is not a digital rights management mechanism. A user is not
prevented from using other mechanisms to record or forward media. This
means that (for example) screen-recording devices, tape recorders,
portable cameras, or a cunning arrangement of mirrors could variously be
used to record or redistribute media once delivered. Similarly, if media
is visible or audible (or otherwise accessible) to others in the
vicinity, there are no technical measures that protect the
confidentiality of that media.[¶](#section-4-3){.pilcrow}

The only guarantee provided by this mechanism and the browser that
implements it is that the media was delivered to the user that was
authenticated. Individual users will still need to make a judgment about
how their peer intends to respect the confidentiality of any information
provided.[¶](#section-4-4){.pilcrow}

On a shared computing platform like a browser, other entities with
access to that platform (i.e., web applications) might be able to access
information that would compromise the confidentiality of communications.
Implementations [MAY]{.bcp14} choose to limit concurrent access to input
devices during confidential communications
sessions.[¶](#section-4-5){.pilcrow}

For instance, another application that is able to access a microphone
might be able to sample confidential audio that is playing through
speakers. This is true even if acoustic echo cancellation, which
attempts to prevent this from happening, is used. Similarly, an
application with access to a video camera might be able to use
reflections to obtain all or part of a confidential video
stream.[¶](#section-4-6){.pilcrow}
