DetNet (Deterministic Networking) provides the ability to carry
specified unicast or multicast data flows for real-time applications
with extremely low packet loss rates and assured maximum end-to-end
delivery latency. A description of the general background and concepts
of DetNet can be found in
\[[RFC8655](#RFC8655){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

This document describes the concepts needed by any DetNet data plane
specification (i.e., the DetNet-specific use of packet header fields)
and provides considerations for any corresponding implementation. It
covers the building blocks that provide the DetNet service, the DetNet
service sub‑layer, and the DetNet forwarding sub‑layer functions as
described in the DetNet architecture
\[[RFC8655](#RFC8655){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

The DetNet architecture models the DetNet-related data plane functions
as being decomposed into two sub‑layers: a service sub‑layer and a
forwarding sub‑layer. The service sub‑layer is used to provide DetNet
service protection and reordering. The forwarding sub‑layer leverages
traffic engineering mechanisms and provides congestion protection (low
loss, assured latency, and limited out-of-order delivery). A particular
forwarding sub‑layer may have capabilities that are not available on
other forwarding sub‑layers. DetNet makes use of the existing forwarding
sub‑layers with their respective capabilities and does not require 1:1
equivalence between different forwarding sub‑layer
capabilities.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

As part of the service sub‑layer functions, this document describes
typical DetNet node data plane operation. It describes the functionality
and operation of the Packet Replication Function (PRF), the Packet
Elimination Function (PEF), and the Packet Ordering Function (POF)
within the service sub‑layer. Furthermore, it describes the forwarding
sub‑layer.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

As defined in \[[RFC8655](#RFC8655){.xref}\], DetNet flows may be
carried over network technologies that can provide service
characteristics required by DetNet. For example, DetNet MPLS flows can
be carried over IEEE 802.1 Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) sub-networks
\[[IEEE802.1TSNTG](#IEEE802.1TSNTG){.xref}\]. However, IEEE 802.1 TSN
support is not required in DetNet. TSN frame preemption is an example of
a forwarding layer capability that is typically not replicated in other
forwarding technologies. Most of DetNet\'s benefits can be gained by
running over a data-link layer that has not been specifically enhanced
to support all TSN capabilities, but for such networks and traffic
mixes, delay and jitter performance may vary due to the forwarding
sub‑layer\'s intrinsic properties.[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}

Different application flows, such as Ethernet or IP, can be mapped on
top of DetNet. DetNet can optionally reuse header information provided
by, or shared with, applications. An example of shared header fields can
be found in \[[RFC8939](#RFC8939){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-6){.pilcrow}

This document also covers basic concepts related to the Controller Plane
and Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM). Data plane OAM
specifics are out of scope for this document.[¶](#section-1-7){.pilcrow}

:::

The DetNet forwarding sub‑layer may be directly provided by the DetNet
service sub‑layer \-- for example, by IP tunnels or MPLS. Alternatively,
an overlay approach may be used in which the packet is natively carried
between key nodes within the DetNet network (say, between PREOF nodes),
and a sub‑layer is used to provide the information needed to reach the
next hop in the overlay.[¶](#section-3-4){.pilcrow}

The forwarding sub‑layer provides the QoS-related functions needed by
the DetNet flow. It may do this directly through the use of queuing
techniques and traffic engineering methods, or it may do this through
the assistance of its underlying connectivity. For example, it may call
upon Ethernet TSN capabilities defined in IEEE 802.1 TSN
\[[IEEE802.1TSNTG](#IEEE802.1TSNTG){.xref}\]. The forwarding sub‑layer
uses buffer resources for packet queuing, as well as reservation and
allocation of bandwidth capacity resources.[¶](#section-3-5){.pilcrow}

The service sub‑layer provides additional support beyond the
connectivity function of the forwarding sub‑layer. See [Section
4.3](#PREOF){.xref} regarding PREOF. The POF uses sequence numbers added
to packets, enabling a range of packet order protection from simple
ordering and dropping out-of-order packets to more complex reordering of
a fixed number of out-of-order, minimally delayed packets. Reordering
requires buffer resources and has an impact on the delay and jitter of
packets in the DetNet flow.[¶](#section-3-6){.pilcrow}

The method of instantiating each of the layers is specific to the
particular DetNet data plane method, and more than one approach may be
applicable to a given network type.[¶](#section-3-7){.pilcrow}

The DetNet data plane is provided by the DetNet service and forwarding
sub‑layers. The DetNet service sub‑layer generally provides its
functions for the DetNet application flows by using or applying existing
standardized headers and/or encapsulations. The DetNet forwarding
sub‑layer may provide capabilities leveraging that same header or
encapsulation technology (e.g., DN IP or DN MPLS), or it may be achieved
via other technologies, as shown in [Figure 2](#dn_svc_encaps){.xref}
below. DetNet is currently defined for operation over packet-switched
(IP) networks or label-switched (MPLS)
networks.[¶](#section-3.1.1-1){.pilcrow}

#### [3.1.2.](#section-3.1.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Encapsulation](#name-encapsulation){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-encapsulation}

DetNet encodes specific flow attributes (flow identity and sequence
number) in packets. For example, in DetNet IP, zero encapsulation is
used, and no sequence number is available; in DetNet MPLS,
DetNet-specific information may be added explicitly to the packets in
the form of an S-Label and a d-CW
\[[DetNet-MPLS](#DetNet-MPLS){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3.1.2-1){.pilcrow}

The encapsulation of a DetNet flow allows it to be sent over a data
plane technology other than its native type. DetNet uses header
information to perform traffic classification, i.e., identify DetNet
flows, and provide DetNet service and forwarding functions. As mentioned
above, DetNet may add headers, as is the case for DN MPLS, or may use
headers that are already present, as is the case for DN IP. [Figure
2](#dn_svc_encaps){.xref} illustrates some relationships between the
components.[¶](#section-3.1.2-2){.pilcrow}

The use of encapsulation is also required if additional information
(metadata) is needed by the DetNet data plane and either (1) there is no
ability to include it in the client data packet or (2) the specification
of the client data plane does not permit the modification of the packet
to include additional data. An example of such metadata is the inclusion
of a sequence number required by PREOF.[¶](#section-3.1.2-4){.pilcrow}

with limited DetNet capability.[¶](#section-3.1.2-5){.pilcrow}

### [3.2.](#section-3.2){.section-number .selfRef} [DetNet-Specific Metadata](#name-detnet-specific-metadata){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-detnet-specific-metadata}

The DetNet data plane can provide or carry the following
metadata:[¶](#section-3.2-1){.pilcrow}

1.  [Flow-ID[¶](#section-3.2-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.2-2.1}
2.  [Sequence number[¶](#section-3.2-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.2-2.2}

The DetNet data plane framework supports a Flow-ID (for identification
of the flow or aggregate flow) and/or a sequence number (for PREOF) for
each DetNet flow. The Flow-ID is used by both the service and forwarding
sub‑layers, but the sequence number is only used by the service layer.
Metadata can also be used for OAM indications and instrumentation of
DetNet data plane operation.[¶](#section-3.2-3){.pilcrow}

Metadata inclusion can be implicit or explicit. Explicit inclusions
involve a dedicated header field that is used to include metadata in a
DetNet packet. In the implicit method, part of an already-existing
header field is used to encode the
metadata.[¶](#section-3.2-4){.pilcrow}

Explicit inclusion of metadata is possible through the use of IP options
or IP extension headers. New IP options are almost impossible to get
standardized or to deploy in an operational network and will not be
discussed further in this text. IPv6 extension headers are finding
popularity in current IPv6 development work, particularly in connection
with Segment Routing of IPv6 (SRv6) and IP OAM. The design of a new IPv6
extension header or the modification of an existing one is a technique
available in the toolbox of the DetNet IP data plane
designer.[¶](#section-3.2-5){.pilcrow}

Explicit inclusion of metadata in an IP packet is also possible through
the inclusion of an MPLS label stack and the MPLS d-CW, using one of the
methods for carrying MPLS over IP
\[[DetNet-MPLS-over-UDP-IP](#DetNet-MPLS-over-UDP-IP){.xref}\]. This is
described in more detail in [Section
3.5.5](#subnet_considerations){.xref}.[¶](#section-3.2-6){.pilcrow}

Implicit metadata in IP can be included through the use of the network
programming paradigm \[[SRv6-Network-Prog](#SRv6-Network-Prog){.xref}\],
in which the suffix of an IPv6 address is used to encode additional
information for use by the network of the receiving
host.[¶](#section-3.2-7){.pilcrow}

An MPLS example of explicit metadata is the sequence number used by
PREOF, or even the case where all the essential information is included
in the DetNet-over-MPLS label stack (the d-CW and the DetNet
S-Label).[¶](#section-3.2-8){.pilcrow}

An IP data plane may operate natively or through the use of an
encapsulation. Many types of IP encapsulation can satisfy DetNet
requirements, and it is anticipated that more than one encapsulation may
be deployed \-- for example, GRE, IPsec.[¶](#section-3.3-1){.pilcrow}

One method of operating an IP DetNet data plane without encapsulation is
to use 6-tuple-based flow identification, where \"6-tuple\" refers to
information carried in IP-layer and higher-layer protocol headers.
General background on the use of IP headers and 6-tuples to identify
flows and support QoS can be found in \[[RFC3670](#RFC3670){.xref}\].
The extra field in the 6-tuple is the DSCP field in the packet.
\[[RFC7657](#RFC7657){.xref}\] provides useful background on
differentiated services (Diffserv) and tuple-based flow identification.
DetNet flow aggregation may be enabled via the use of wildcards, masks,
prefixes, and ranges. The operation of this method is described in
detail in \[[RFC8939](#RFC8939){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3.3-2){.pilcrow}

The DetNet forwarding plane may use explicit route capabilities and
traffic engineering capabilities to provide a forwarding sub‑layer that
is responsible for providing resource allocation and explicit routes. It
is possible to include such information in a native IP packet either
explicitly or implicitly.[¶](#section-3.3-3){.pilcrow}

MPLS provides a forwarding sub‑layer for traffic over implicit and
explicit paths to the point in the network where the next DetNet service
sub‑layer action needs to take place. It does this through the use of a
stack of one or more labels with various forwarding
semantics.[¶](#section-3.4-1){.pilcrow}

MPLS also provides the ability to identify a service instance that is
used to process the packet through the use of a label that maps the
packet to a service instance.[¶](#section-3.4-2){.pilcrow}

In cases where metadata is needed to process an MPLS-encapsulated packet
at the service sub‑layer, the d-CW
\[[DetNet-MPLS](#DetNet-MPLS){.xref}\] can be used. Although such d-CWs
are frequently 32 bits long, there is no architectural constraint on the
size of this structure \-- only the requirement that it be fully
understood by all parties operating on it in the DetNet service
sub‑layer. The operation of this method is described in detail in

Resources might be reserved in order to make them available for
allocation to specific DetNet flows. This can eliminate packet
contention and packet loss for DetNet traffic. This also can reduce
jitter for DetNet traffic. Resources allocated to a DetNet flow protect
it from other traffic flows. On the other hand, it is assumed that
DetNet flows behave in accordance with the reserved traffic profile. It
must be possible to detect misbehaving DetNet flows and to ensure that
they do not compromise QoS of other flows. Queuing, policing, and
shaping policies can be used to ensure that the allocation of resources
reserved for DetNet is met.[¶](#section-3.5.1.1-1){.pilcrow}

A flow can be routed over a specific, precomputed path. This allows
control of network delay by steering the packet with the ability to
influence the physical path. Explicit routes complement reservation by
ensuring that a consistent path can be associated with its resources for
the duration of that path. Coupled with the traffic mechanism, this
limits misordering and bounds latency. Explicit route computation can
encompass a wide set of constraints and can optimize the path for a
certain characteristic, e.g., highest bandwidth or lowest jitter. In
these cases, the \"best\" path for any set of characteristics may not be
a shortest path. The selection of the path can take into account
multiple network metrics. Some of these metrics are measured and
distributed by the routing system as traffic engineering
metrics.[¶](#section-3.5.1.2-1){.pilcrow}

Service protection involves the use of multiple packet streams using
multiple paths \-- for example, 1+1 or 1:1 linear protection. For
DetNet, this primarily relates to packet replication and elimination
capabilities. MPLS offers a number of protection schemes. MPLS hitless
protection can be used to switch traffic to an already-established path
in order to restore delivery rapidly after a failure. Path changes, even
in the case of failure recovery, can lead to the out-of-order delivery
of data requiring POFs either within the DetNet service or at a high
layer in the application traffic. Establishment of new paths after a
failure is out of scope for DetNet
services.[¶](#section-3.5.1.3-1){.pilcrow}

Network Coding \[[nwcrg](#nwcrg){.xref}\], not to be confused with
network programming, comprises several techniques where multiple data
flows are encoded. These resulting flows can then be sent on different
paths. The encoding operation can combine flows and error recovery
information. When the encoded flows are decoded and recombined, the
original flows can be recovered. Note that Network Coding uses an
alternative to packet-by-packet PREOF. Therefore, for certain network
topologies and traffic loads, Network Coding can be used to improve a
network\'s throughput, efficiency, latency, and scalability, as well as
resilience to partition, attacks, and eavesdropping, as compared to
traditional methods. DetNet could use Network Coding as an alternative
to other means of protection. Network Coding is often applied in
wireless networks and is being explored for other network
types.[¶](#section-3.5.1.4-1){.pilcrow}

:::

In [Figure 3](#dn_protection_flow){.xref}, the numbers are used to
identify the instance of a packet. Packet 1 is the original packet.
Packets 1.1 and 1.2 are two first-generation copies of packet 1, packet
1.2.1 is a second-generation copy of packet 1.2, and so on. Note that
these numbers never appear in the packet and are not to be confused with
sequence numbers, labels, or any other identifiers that appear in the
packet. They simply indicate the generation number of the original
packet so that its passage through the network fragment can be
identified for the reader.[¶](#section-3.5.2.1-3){.pilcrow}

Customer Equipment device CE1 sends a packet into the DetNet-enabled
network. This is packet 1. Edge Node EN1 encapsulates the packet as a
DetNet packet and sends it to Relay Node R1 (packet 1.1). EN1 makes a
copy of the packet (1.2), encapsulates it, and sends this copy to Relay
Node R4.[¶](#section-3.5.2.1-4){.pilcrow}

Note that R1 may be directly attached to EN1, or there may be one or
more nodes on the path that, for clarity, are not shown in [Figure
3](#dn_protection_flow){.xref}. The same holds true for any other path
between two DetNet entities as shown in the
figure.[¶](#section-3.5.2.1-5){.pilcrow}

Relay Node R4 has been configured to send one copy of the packet to
Relay Node R2 (packet 1.2.1) and one copy to Edge Node EN2 (packet
1.2.2).[¶](#section-3.5.2.1-6){.pilcrow}

R2 receives packet copy 1.2.1 before packet copy 1.1 arrives and, having
been configured to perform packet elimination on this DetNet flow,
forwards packet 1.2.1 to Relay Node R3. Packet copy 1.1 is of no further
use and so is discarded by R2.[¶](#section-3.5.2.1-7){.pilcrow}

Edge Node EN2 receives packet copy 1.2.2 from R4 before it receives
packet copy 1.2.1 from R2 via Relay Node R3. EN2 therefore strips any
DetNet encapsulation from packet copy 1.2.2 and forwards the packet to
CE2. When EN2 receives packet copy 1.2.1 later on, the copy is
discarded.[¶](#section-3.5.2.1-8){.pilcrow}

The above is of course illustrative of many network scenarios that can
be configured.[¶](#section-3.5.2.1-9){.pilcrow}

This example also illustrates a 1:1 protection scheme, meaning there is
traffic over each segment of the end-to-end path. Local DetNet relay
nodes determine which packets are eliminated and which packets are
forwarded. A 1+1 scheme where only one path is used for traffic at a
time could use the same topology. In this case, there is no PRF, and
traffic is switched upon detection of failure. An OAM scheme that
monitors the paths to detect the loss of a path or traffic is required
to initiate the switch. A POF may still be used in this case to prevent
misordering of packets. In both cases, the protection paths are
established and maintained for the duration of the DetNet
service.[¶](#section-3.5.2.1-10){.pilcrow}

In the preceding example, proper operation of duplicate elimination and
the reordering of packets are dependent on the number of out-of-order
packets that can be buffered and the difference in delay of the arriving
packets. DetNet uses flow-specific requirements (e.g., maximum number of
out-of-order packets, maximum latency of the flow) for configuration of
POF-related buffers. If the differential delay between paths is
excessively large or there is excessive misordering of the packets, then
packets may be dropped instead of being reordered. Likewise, the PEF
uses the sequence number to identify duplicate packets, and large
differential delays combined with high numbers of packets may exceed the
PEF\'s ability to work properly.[¶](#section-3.5.2.2-1){.pilcrow}

The DetNet data plane also allows for the aggregation of DetNet flows,
which can improve scalability by reducing the per-hop state. How this is
accomplished is data plane or control plane dependent. When DetNet flows
are aggregated, transit nodes provide service to the aggregate and not
on a per-DetNet-flow basis. When aggregating DetNet flows, the flows
should be compatible, i.e., the same or very similar QoS and CoS
characteristics. In this case, nodes performing aggregation will ensure
that per-flow service requirements are
achieved.[¶](#section-3.5.3-1){.pilcrow}

If bandwidth reservations are used, the reservation should be the sum of
all the individual reservations; in other words, the reservations should
not add up to an oversubscription of bandwidth reservation. If maximum
delay bounds are used, the system should ensure that the aggregate does
not exceed the delay bounds of the individual
flows.[¶](#section-3.5.3-2){.pilcrow}

Data flows requiring DetNet service are generated and terminated on end

For example, in a DetNet MPLS domain, the sub‑layer functions use the
d-CWs, S-Labels, and F-Labels \[[DetNet-MPLS](#DetNet-MPLS){.xref}\] to
provide DetNet services. However, an application may exchange further

As a general rule, DetNet domains are capable of forwarding any DetNet
flows, and the DetNet domain does not mandate the encapsulation format
for end systems or edge nodes. Unless some form of proxy is present, end
systems peer with similar end systems using the same application
encapsulation format. For example, as shown in [Figure

Any of the DetNet service types may be transported by another DetNet
service. MPLS nodes may be interconnected by different sub-network
technologies, which may include point-to-point links. Each of these
sub-network technologies needs to provide appropriate service to DetNet
flows. In some cases, e.g., on dedicated point-to-point links or TDM
technologies, all that is required is for a DetNet node to appropriately
queue its output traffic. In other cases, DetNet nodes will need to map
DetNet flows to the flow semantics (i.e., identifiers) and mechanisms
used by an underlying sub-network technology. [Figure
5](#fig_dn_mpls_sn_ex){.xref} shows several examples of sub-network
encapsulations that can be used to carry DetNet MPLS flows over
different sub-network technologies. L2 represents a generic Layer 2
encapsulation that might be used on a point-to-point link. TSN
represents the encapsulation used on an IEEE 802.1 TSN network, as
described in \[[DetNet-MPLS-over-TSN](#DetNet-MPLS-over-TSN){.xref}\].
UDP/IP represents the encapsulation used on a DetNet IP PSN, as

### [4.1.](#section-4.1){.section-number .selfRef} [DetNet Controller Plane Requirements](#name-detnet-controller-plane-req){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-detnet-controller-plane-req}

The Controller Plane corresponds to the aggregation of the Control and
Management Planes discussed in \[[RFC7426](#RFC7426){.xref}\] and
\[[RFC8655](#RFC8655){.xref}\]. While more details regarding any DetNet
Controller Plane are out of scope for this document, there are
particular considerations and requirements for the Controller Plane that
result from the unique characteristics of the DetNet architecture and
data plane as defined herein.[¶](#section-4.1-1){.pilcrow}

The primary requirements of the DetNet Controller Plane are that it must
be able to:[¶](#section-4.1-2){.pilcrow}

-   [Instantiate DetNet flows in a DetNet domain (which may, for
    example, include some or all of the following: explicit path
    determination, link bandwidth reservations, restricting flows to
    IEEE 802.1 TSN links, node buffer and other resource reservations,
    specification of required queuing disciplines along the path,
    ability to manage bidirectional flows, etc.) as needed for a
    flow.[¶](#section-4.1-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.1-3.1}
-   [In the case of MPLS, manage DetNet S-Label and F-Label allocation
    and distribution. In cases where the DetNet MPLS encapsulation is
    being used, see
    \[[DetNet-MPLS](#DetNet-MPLS){.xref}\].[¶](#section-4.1-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.1-3.2}
-   [Support DetNet flow
    aggregation.[¶](#section-4.1-3.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.1-3.3}
-   [Advertise static and dynamic node and link resources such as
    capabilities and adjacencies to other network nodes (for dynamic
    signaling approaches) or to network controllers (for centralized
    approaches).[¶](#section-4.1-3.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.1-3.4}
-   [Scale to handle the number of DetNet flows expected in a domain
    (which may require per-flow signaling or
    provisioning).[¶](#section-4.1-3.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.1-3.5}
-   [Provision flow identification information at each of the nodes
    along the path. Flow identification may differ, depending on the
    location in the network and the DetNet functionality (e.g., transit
    node vs. relay
    node).[¶](#section-4.1-3.6){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.1-3.6}

These requirements, as stated earlier, could be satisfied using
distributed control protocol signaling (such as RSVP-TE), centralized
network management provisioning mechanisms (BGP, PCEP, YANG,
\[[DetNet-Flow-Info](#I-D.ietf-detnet-flow-information-model){.xref}\],
etc.), or hybrid combinations of the two, and could also make use of
MPLS-based segment routing.[¶](#section-4.1-4){.pilcrow}

In the abstract, the results of either distributed signaling or
centralized provisioning are equivalent from a DetNet data plane
perspective \-- flows are instantiated, explicit routes are determined,
resources are reserved, and packets are forwarded through the domain
using the DetNet data plane.[¶](#section-4.1-5){.pilcrow}

However, from a practical and implementation standpoint, Controller
Plane alternatives are not equivalent at all. Some approaches are more
scalable than others in terms of signaling load on the network. Some
alternatives can take advantage of global tracking of resources in the
DetNet domain for better overall network resource optimization. Some
solutions are more resilient than others if link, node, or management
equipment failures occur. While a detailed analysis of the control plane
alternatives is out of scope for this document, the requirements from
this document can be used as the basis of a future analysis of the
alternatives.[¶](#section-4.1-6){.pilcrow}

This section covers control plane considerations that are independent of
the data plane technology used for DetNet service
delivery.[¶](#section-4.2-1){.pilcrow}

While the management plane and the control plane are traditionally
considered separately, from a data plane perspective, there is no
practical difference based on the origin of flow-provisioning
information, and the DetNet architecture \[[RFC8655](#RFC8655){.xref}\]
refers to these collectively as the \"Controller Plane\". This document
therefore does not distinguish between information provided by
distributed control plane protocols (e.g., RSVP-TE
\[[RFC3209](#RFC3209){.xref}\] \[[RFC3473](#RFC3473){.xref}\]) or
centralized network management mechanisms (e.g., RESTCONF
\[[RFC8040](#RFC8040){.xref}\], YANG \[[RFC7950](#RFC7950){.xref}\],
PCEP
\[[PCECC](#I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-extension-for-pce-controller){.xref}\]), or
any combination thereof. Specific considerations and requirements for
the DetNet Controller Plane are discussed in [Section
4.1](#control-management-requirements){.xref}.[¶](#section-4.2-2){.pilcrow}

Each respective data plane document also covers the control plane
considerations for that technology. For example,
\[[RFC8939](#RFC8939){.xref}\] also covers IP control plane normative
considerations, and \[[DetNet-MPLS](#DetNet-MPLS){.xref}\] also covers
MPLS control plane normative
considerations.[¶](#section-4.2-3){.pilcrow}

#### [4.2.1.](#section-4.2.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Flow Aggregation Control](#name-flow-aggregation-control){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-flow-aggregation-control}

Flow aggregation means that multiple App-flows are served by a single
new DetNet flow. There are many techniques to achieve aggregation. For
example, in the case of IP, IP flows that share 6-tuple attributes or
flow identifiers at the DetNet sub‑layer can be grouped. Another example
includes aggregation accomplished through the use of hierarchical LSPs
in MPLS and tunnels.[¶](#section-4.2.1-1){.pilcrow}

Control of aggregation involves a set of procedures listed here.
Aggregation may use some or all of these capabilities, and the order may
vary:[¶](#section-4.2.1-2){.pilcrow}

#### [4.2.2.](#section-4.2.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Explicit Routes](#name-explicit-routes-2){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-explicit-routes-2}

Explicit routes are used to ensure that packets are routed through the
resources that have been reserved for them and hence provide the DetNet
application with the required service. A requirement for the DetNet
Controller Plane will be the ability to assign a particular identified
DetNet IP flow to a path through the DetNet domain that has been
assigned the required per-node resources. This provides the appropriate
traffic treatment for the flow and also includes particular links as a
part of the path that are able to support the DetNet flow. For example,
by using IEEE 802.1 TSN links (as discussed in
\[[DetNet-MPLS-over-TSN](#DetNet-MPLS-over-TSN){.xref}\]), DetNet
parameters can be maintained. Further considerations and requirements
for the DetNet Controller Plane are discussed in [Section
4.1](#control-management-requirements){.xref}.[¶](#section-4.2.2-1){.pilcrow}

Whether configuring, calculating, and instantiating these routes is a
single-stage or multi-stage process, or is performed in a centralized or
distributed manner, is out of scope for this
document.[¶](#section-4.2.2-2){.pilcrow}

There are several approaches that could be used to provide explicit
routes and resource allocation in the DetNet forwarding sub‑layer. For
example:[¶](#section-4.2.2-3){.pilcrow}

-   [The path could be explicitly set up by a controller that calculates
    the path and explicitly configures each node along that path with
    the appropriate forwarding and resource allocation
    information.[¶](#section-4.2.2-4.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.2.2-4.1}
-   [The path could use a distributed control plane such as
    [RSVP](#RFC2205){.xref} \[[RFC2205](#RFC2205){.xref}\] or RSVP-TE
    \[[RFC3473](#RFC3473){.xref}\] extended to support DetNet IP
    flows.[¶](#section-4.2.2-4.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.2.2-4.2}
-   [The path could be implemented using IPv6-based segment routing when
    extended to support resource
    allocation.[¶](#section-4.2.2-4.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.2.2-4.3}

discussion of these alternatives. In addition,
\[[RFC2386](#RFC2386){.xref}\] contains useful background information on
QoS-based routing, and \[[RFC5575](#RFC5575){.xref}\] (which will be
updated by \[[Flow-Spec-Rules](#I-D.ietf-idr-rfc5575bis){.xref}\])

This document does not specify the mechanisms needed to eliminate packet
contention or packet loss or to reduce jitter for DetNet flows at the
DetNet forwarding sub‑layer. The ability to manage node and link
resources to be able to provide these functions is a necessary part of
the DetNet Controller Plane. It is also necessary to be able to control
the required queuing mechanisms used to provide these functions along a
flow\'s path through the network. See \[[RFC8939](#RFC8939){.xref}\] and
[Section 4.1](#control-management-requirements){.xref} for further
discussion of these requirements. Some forms of protection may minimize
packet loss or change jitter characteristics in the cases where packets
are reordered when out-of-order packets are received at the service
sub‑layer.[¶](#section-4.2.3-1){.pilcrow}

#### [4.2.4.](#section-4.2.4){.section-number .selfRef} [Bidirectional Traffic](#name-bidirectional-traffic){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-bidirectional-traffic}

In many cases, DetNet flows can be considered unidirectional and
independent. However, there are cases where the DetNet service requires
bidirectional traffic from a DetNet application service perspective. IP
and MPLS typically treat each direction separately and do not force
interdependence of each direction. The IETF MPLS Working Group has
studied bidirectional traffic requirements. The definitions provided in
\[[RFC5654](#RFC5654){.xref}\] are useful to illustrate terms such as
associated bidirectional flows and co-routed bidirectional flows. MPLS
defines a point-to-point associated bidirectional LSP as consisting of
two unidirectional point-to-point LSPs, one from A to B and the other
from B to A, which are regarded as providing a single logical
bidirectional forwarding path. This is analogous to standard IP routing.
MPLS defines a point-to-point co-routed bidirectional LSP as an
associated bidirectional LSP that satisfies the additional constraint
that its two unidirectional component LSPs follow the same path (in
terms of both nodes and links) in both directions. An important property
of co-routed bidirectional LSPs is that their unidirectional component
LSPs share fate. In both types of bidirectional LSPs, resource
reservations may differ in each direction. The concepts of associated
bidirectional flows and co‑routed bidirectional flows can also be
applied to DetNet IP flows.[¶](#section-4.2.4-1){.pilcrow}

While the DetNet IP data plane must support bidirectional DetNet flows,
there are no special bidirectional features with respect to the data
plane other than the need for the two directions of a co‑routed
bidirectional flow to take the same path. That is to say, bidirectional
DetNet flows are solely represented at the management plane and control
plane levels, without specific support or knowledge within the DetNet
data plane. Fate-sharing and associated or co‑routed bidirectional flows
can be managed at the control level.[¶](#section-4.2.4-2){.pilcrow}

DetNet\'s use of PREOF may increase the complexity of using co‑routing
bidirectional flows, because if PREOF are used, the replication points
in one direction would have to match the elimination points in the other
direction, and vice versa. In such cases, the optimal points for these
functions in one direction may not match the optimal points in the
other, due to network and traffic constraints. Furthermore, due to the
per-packet service protection nature, bidirectional forwarding may not
be ensured. The first packet of received member flows is selected by the
elimination function independently of which path it has taken through
the network.[¶](#section-4.2.4-3){.pilcrow}

Control and management mechanisms need to support bidirectional flows,
but the specification of such mechanisms is out of scope for this
document. Example control plane solutions for MPLS can be found in
\[[RFC3473](#RFC3473){.xref}\], \[[RFC6387](#RFC6387){.xref}\], and
\[[RFC7551](#RFC7551){.xref}\]. These requirements are included in

The Controller Plane protocol solution required for managing the
processing of PREOF is outside the scope of this document. That said, it
should be noted that the ability to determine, for a particular flow,
optimal packet replication and elimination points in the DetNet domain

## [5.](#section-5){.section-number .selfRef} [Security Considerations](#name-security-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-security-considerations}

Security considerations for DetNet are described in detail in
\[[DetNet-Security](#DetNet-Security){.xref}\]. General security
considerations for the DetNet architecture are described in
\[[RFC8655](#RFC8655){.xref}\]. This section considers
architecture-level DetNet security considerations applicable to all data
planes.[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

Part of what makes DetNet unique is its ability to provide specific and
reliable QoS (delivering data flows with extremely low packet loss rates
and bounded end-to-end delivery latency), and the security-related
aspects of protecting that QoS are similarly
unique.[¶](#section-5-2){.pilcrow}

As for all communications protocols, the primary consideration for the
data plane is to maintain integrity of data and delivery of the
associated DetNet service traversing the DetNet network. Application
flows can be protected through whatever means is provided by the
underlying technology. For example, encryption may be used, such as that
provided by IPsec \[[RFC4301](#RFC4301){.xref}\] for IP flows and/or by
an underlying sub-network using MACsec
\[[IEEE802.1AE-2018](#IEEE802.1AE-2018){.xref}\] for Ethernet (Layer 2)
flows.[¶](#section-5-3){.pilcrow}

At the management and control levels, DetNet flows are identified on a
per-flow basis, which may provide Controller Plane attackers with
additional information about the data flows (when compared to Controller
Planes that do not include per-flow identification). This is an inherent
property of DetNet that has security implications that should be
considered when determining if DetNet is a suitable technology for any
given use case.[¶](#section-5-4){.pilcrow}

To provide uninterrupted availability of the DetNet service, provisions
can be made against DoS attacks and delay attacks. To protect against
DoS attacks, excess traffic due to malicious or malfunctioning devices
can be prevented or mitigated \-- for example, through the use of
existing mechanisms such as policing and shaping applied at the input of
a DetNet domain. To prevent DetNet packets from being delayed by an
entity external to a DetNet domain, DetNet technology definitions can
allow for the mitigation of man-in-the-middle attacks \-- for example,
through the use of authentication and authorization of devices within
the DetNet domain.[¶](#section-5-5){.pilcrow}

In order to prevent or mitigate DetNet attacks on other networks via
flow escape, edge devices can, for example, use existing mechanisms such
as policing and shaping applied at the output of a DetNet
domain.[¶](#section-5-6){.pilcrow}
