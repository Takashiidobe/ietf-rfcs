# Multipoint Alternate-Marking Method for Passive and Hybrid Performance Monitoring {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

The Alternate-Marking method, as presented in RFC 8321, can only be
applied to point-to-point flows, because it assumes that all the packets
of the flow measured on one node are measured again by a single second
node. This document generalizes and expands this methodology to measure
any kind of unicast flow whose packets can follow several different
paths in the network \-- in wider terms, a multipoint-to-multipoint
network. For this reason, the technique here described is called
\"Multipoint Alternate Marking\".[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

The Alternate-Marking method, as described in [RFC
8321](#RFC8321){.xref} \[[RFC8321](#RFC8321){.xref}\], is applicable to
a point-to-point path. The extension proposed in this document applies
to the most general case of multipoint-to-multipoint path and enables
flexible and adaptive performance measurements in a managed
network.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

The Alternate-Marking methodology described in [RFC
8321](#RFC8321){.xref} \[[RFC8321](#RFC8321){.xref}\] allows the
synchronization of the measurements in different points by dividing the
packet flow into batches. So it is possible to get coherent counters and
show what is happening in every marking period for each monitored flow.
The monitoring parameters are the packet counter and timestamps of a
flow for each marking period. Note that additional details about the
applicability of the Alternate-Marking methodology are described in [RFC
8321](#RFC8321){.xref} \[[RFC8321](#RFC8321){.xref}\] while
implementation details can be found in the paper \"AM-PM: Efficient
Network Telemetry using Alternate Marking\"
\[[IEEE-Network-PNPM](#IEEE-Network-PNPM){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

There are some applications of the Alternate-Marking method where there
are a lot of monitored flows and nodes. Multipoint Alternate Marking
aims to reduce these values and makes the performance monitoring more
flexible in case a detailed analysis is not needed. For instance, by
considering n measurement points and m monitored flows, the order of
magnitude of the packet counters for each time interval is n\*m\*2 (1
per color). The number of measurement points and monitored flows may
vary and depends on the portion of the network we are monitoring (core
network, metro network, access network) and the granularity (for each
service, each customer). So if both n and m are high values, the packet
counters increase a lot, and Multipoint Alternate Marking offers a tool
to control these parameters.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

The approach presented in this document is applied only to unicast flows
and not to multicast. Broadcast, Unknown Unicast, and Multicast (BUM)
traffic is not considered here, because traffic replication is not
covered by the Multipoint Alternate-Marking method. Furthermore, it can
be applicable to anycast flows, and Equal-Cost Multipath (ECMP) paths
can also be easily monitored with this
technique.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

In short, [RFC 8321](#RFC8321){.xref} \[[RFC8321](#RFC8321){.xref}\]
applies to point-to-point unicast flows and BUM traffic, while this
document and its Clustered Alternate-Marking method is valid for
multipoint-to-multipoint unicast flows, anycast, and ECMP
flows.[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}

Therefore,the Alternate-Marking method can be extended to any kind of
multipoint-to-multipoint paths, and the network-clustering approach
presented in this document is the formalization of how to implement this
property and allow a flexible and optimized performance measurement
support for network management in every
situation.[¶](#section-1-6){.pilcrow}

Without network clustering, it is possible to apply Alternate Marking
only for all the network or per single flow. Instead, with network
clustering, it is possible to use the partition of the network into
clusters at different levels in order to perform the needed degree of
detail. In some circumstances, it is possible to monitor a multipoint
network by analyzing the network clustering, without examining in depth.
In case of problems (packet loss is measured or the delay is too high),
the filtering criteria could be specified more in order to perform a
detailed analysis by using a different combination of clusters up to a
per-flow measurement as described in [RFC 8321](#RFC8321){.xref}
\[[RFC8321](#RFC8321){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-7){.pilcrow}

This approach fits very well with the Closed-Loop Network and
Software-Defined Network (SDN) paradigm, where the SDN orchestrator and
the SDN controllers are the brains of the network and can manage flow
control to the switches and routers and, in the same way, can calibrate
the performance measurements depending on the desired accuracy. An SDN
controller application can orchestrate how accurately the network
performance monitoring is set up by applying the Multipoint Alternate
Marking as described in this document.[¶](#section-1-8){.pilcrow}

It is important to underline that, as an extension of [RFC
8321](#RFC8321){.xref} \[[RFC8321](#RFC8321){.xref}\], this is a
methodology document, so the mechanism that can be used to transmit the
counters and the timestamps is out of scope here, and the implementation
is open. Several options are possible \-- e.g., see \"Enhanced Alternate
Marking Method\"
\[[ENHANCED-ALTERNATE-MARKING](#I-D.zhou-ippm-enhanced-alternate-marking){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-9){.pilcrow}

Note that the fragmented packets case can be managed with the
Alternate-Marking methodology only if fragmentation happens outside the
portion of the network that is monitored. This is always true for both
[RFC 8321](#RFC8321){.xref} \[[RFC8321](#RFC8321){.xref}\] and
Multipoint Alternate Marking, as explained
here.[¶](#section-1-10){.pilcrow}

The definitions of the basic terms are identical to those found in
Alternate Marking \[[RFC8321](#RFC8321){.xref}\]. It is to be remembered
that [RFC 8321](#RFC8321){.xref} \[[RFC8321](#RFC8321){.xref}\] is valid
for point-to-point unicast flows and BUM
traffic.[¶](#section-2-1){.pilcrow}

The important new terms that need to be explained are listed
below:[¶](#section-2-2){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

Multipoint Alternate Marking:
:   Extension to [RFC 8321](#RFC8321){.xref}
    \[[RFC8321](#RFC8321){.xref}\], valid for multipoint-to-multipoint
    unicast flows, anycast, and ECMP flows. It can also be referred to
    as Clustered Alternate Marking.[¶](#section-2-3.2){.pilcrow}
:   

Flow definition:
:   The concept of flow is generalized in this document. The
    identification fields are selected without any constraints and, in
    general, the flow can be a multipoint-to-multipoint flow, as a
    result of aggregate point-to-point
    flows.[¶](#section-2-3.4){.pilcrow}
:   

Monitoring network:
:   Identified with the nodes of the network that are the measurement
    points (MPs) and the links that are the connections between MPs. The
    monitoring network graph depends on the flow definition, so it can
    represent a specific flow or the entire network topology as
    aggregate of all the flows.[¶](#section-2-3.6){.pilcrow}
:   

Cluster:
:   Smallest identifiable subnetwork of the entire monitoring network
    graph that still satisfies the condition that the number of packets
    that go in is the same as the number that go
    out.[¶](#section-2-3.8){.pilcrow}
:   

Multipoint metrics:
:   Packet loss, delay, and delay variation are extended to the case of
    multipoint flows. It is possible to compute these metrics on the
    basis of multipoint paths in order to associate the measurements to
    a cluster, a combination of clusters, or the entire monitored
    network. For delay and delay variation, it is also possible to
    define the metrics on a single-packet basis, and it means that the
    multipoint path is used to easily couple packets between input and
    output nodes of a multipoint path.[¶](#section-2-3.10){.pilcrow}
:   

The next section highlights the correlation with the terms used in [RFC
5644](#RFC5644){.xref}
\[[RFC5644](#RFC5644){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2-4){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-2.1 .section}
### [2.1.](#section-2.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Correlation with RFC 5644](#name-correlation-with-rfc-5644){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-correlation-with-rfc-5644}

[RFC 5644](#RFC5644){.xref} \[[RFC5644](#RFC5644){.xref}\] is limited to
active measurements using a single source packet or stream. Its scope is
also limited to observations of corresponding packets along the path
(spatial metric) and at one or more destinations (one-to-group) along
the path.[¶](#section-2.1-1){.pilcrow}

Instead, the scope of this memo is to define multiparty metrics for
passive and hybrid measurements in a group-to-group topology with
multiple sources and destinations.[¶](#section-2.1-2){.pilcrow}

[RFC 5644](#RFC5644){.xref} \[[RFC5644](#RFC5644){.xref}\] introduces
metric names that can be reused here but have to be extended and
rephrased to be applied to the Alternate-Marking
schema:[¶](#section-2.1-3){.pilcrow}

a.  [the multiparty metrics are not only one-to-group metrics but can be
    also group-to-group
    metrics;[¶](#section-2.1-4.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.1-4.1}
b.  [the spatial metrics, used for measuring the performance of segments
    of a source to destination path, are applied here to group-to-group
    segments (called
    clusters).[¶](#section-2.1-4.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.1-4.2}

::: {#section-3 .section}
## [3.](#section-3){.section-number .selfRef} [Flow Classification](#name-flow-classification){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-flow-classification}

A unicast flow is identified by all the packets having a set of common
characteristics. This definition is inspired by [RFC
7011](#RFC7011){.xref}
\[[RFC7011](#RFC7011){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

As an example, by considering a flow as all the packets sharing the same
source IP address or the same destination IP address, it is easy to
understand that the resulting pattern will not be a point-to-point
connection, but a point-to-multipoint or multipoint-to-point
connection.[¶](#section-3-2){.pilcrow}

In general, a flow can be defined by a set of selection rules used to
match a subset of the packets processed by the network device. These
rules specify a set of Layer 3 and Layer 4 header fields (identification
fields) and the relative values that must be found in matching
packets.[¶](#section-3-3){.pilcrow}

The choice of the identification fields directly affects the type of
paths that the flow would follow in the network. In fact, it is possible
to relate a set of identification fields with the pattern of the
resulting graphs, as listed in [Figure
1](#Flows){.xref}.[¶](#section-3-4){.pilcrow}

A TCP 5-tuple usually identifies flows following either a single path or
a point-to-point multipath (in the case of load balancing). On the
contrary, a single source address selects aggregate flows following a
point-to-multipoint, while a multipoint-to-point can be the result of a
matching on a single destination address. In the case where a selection
rule and its reverse are used for bidirectional measurements, they can
correspond to a point-to-multipoint in one direction and a
multipoint-to-point in the opposite
direction.[¶](#section-3-5){.pilcrow}

So the flows to be monitored are selected into the monitoring points
using packet selection rules, which can also change the pattern of the
monitored network.[¶](#section-3-6){.pilcrow}

Note that, more generally, the flow can be defined at different levels
based on the potential encapsulation, and additional conditions that are
not in the packet header can also be included as part of matching
criteria.[¶](#section-3-7){.pilcrow}

The Alternate-Marking method is applicable only to a single path (and
partially to a one-to-one multipath), so the extension proposed in this
document is suitable also for the most general case of
multipoint-to-multipoint, which embraces all the other patterns of
[Figure 1](#Flows){.xref}.[¶](#section-3-8){.pilcrow}

The case of unicast flow is considered in [Figure 1](#Flows){.xref}. The
anycast flow is also in scope, because there is no replication and only
a single node from the anycast group receives the traffic, so it can be
viewed as a special case of unicast flow. Furthermore, an ECMP flow is
in scope by definition, since it is a point-to-multipoint unicast
flow.[¶](#section-3-10){.pilcrow}

By using the Alternate-Marking method, only point-to-point paths can be
monitored. To have an IP (TCP/UDP) flow that follows a point-to-point
path, we have to define, with a specific value, 5 identification fields
(IP Source, IP Destination, Transport Protocol, Source Port, Destination
Port).[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

Multipoint Alternate Marking enables the performance measurement for
multipoint flows selected by identification fields without any
constraints (even the entire network production traffic). It is also
possible to use multiple marking points for the same monitored
flow.[¶](#section-4-2){.pilcrow}

The monitoring network is deduced from the production network by
identifying the nodes of the graph that are the measurement points, and
the links that are the connections between measurement
points.[¶](#section-4.1-1){.pilcrow}

There are some techniques that can help with the building of the
monitoring network (as an example, see
\[[ROUTE-ASSESSMENT](#I-D.ietf-ippm-route){.xref}\]). In general, there
are different options: the monitoring network can be obtained by
considering all the possible paths for the traffic or periodically
checking the traffic (e.g. daily, weekly, monthly) and updating the
graph as appropriate, but this is up to the Network Management System
(NMS) configuration.[¶](#section-4.1-2){.pilcrow}

So a graph model of the monitoring network can be built according to the
Alternate-Marking method: the monitored interfaces and links are
identified. Only the measurement points and links where the traffic has
flowed have to be represented in the graph.[¶](#section-4.1-3){.pilcrow}

Each monitoring point is characterized by the packet counter that refers
only to a marking period of the monitored

The same is also applicable for the delay, but it will be described in
the following sections.[¶](#section-4.1-7){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-5 .section}
## [5.](#section-5){.section-number .selfRef} [Multipoint Packet Loss](#name-multipoint-packet-loss){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-multipoint-packet-loss}

Since all the packets of the considered flow leaving the network have
previously entered the network, the number of packets counted by all the
input nodes is always greater than, or equal to, the number of packets
counted by all the output nodes. Noninitial fragments are not considered
here.[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

The assumption is the use of the Alternate-Marking method. In the case
of no packet loss occurring in the marking period, if all the input and
output points of the network domain to be monitored are measurement
points, the sum of the number of packets on all the ingress interfaces
equals the number on egress interfaces for the monitored flow. In this
circumstance, if no packet loss occurs, the intermediate measurement
points only have the task of splitting the
measurement.[¶](#section-5-2){.pilcrow}

It is possible to define the Network Packet Loss of one monitored flow
for a single period. In a packet network, the number of lost packets is
the number of packets counted by the input nodes minus the number of
packets counted by the output nodes. This is true for every packet flow
in each marking period.[¶](#section-5-3){.pilcrow}

The monitored network packet loss with n input nodes and m output nodes
is given by:[¶](#section-5-4){.pilcrow}

PL = (PI1 + PI2 +\...+ PIn) - (PO1 + PO2 +\...+
POm)[¶](#section-5-5){.pilcrow}

where:[¶](#section-5-6){.pilcrow}

PL is the network packet loss (number of lost
packets)[¶](#section-5-7){.pilcrow}

PIi is the number of packets flowed through the i-th input node in this
period[¶](#section-5-8){.pilcrow}

POj is the number of packets flowed through the j-th output node in this
period[¶](#section-5-9){.pilcrow}

The equation is applied on a per-time-interval basis and a per-flow
basis:[¶](#section-5-10){.pilcrow}

-   [The reference interval is the Alternate-Marking period, as defined

## [6.](#section-6){.section-number .selfRef} [Network Clustering](#name-network-clustering){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-network-clustering}

The previous equation can determine the number of packets lost globally
in the monitored network, exploiting only the data provided by the
counters in the input and output nodes.[¶](#section-6-1){.pilcrow}

In addition, it is also possible to leverage the data provided by the
other counters in the network to converge on the smallest identifiable
subnetworks where the losses occur. These subnetworks are named
\"clusters\".[¶](#section-6-2){.pilcrow}

A cluster graph is a subnetwork of the entire monitoring network graph
that still satisfies the packet loss equation (introduced in the
previous section), where PL in this case is the number of packets lost
in the cluster. As for the entire monitoring network graph, the cluster
is defined on a per-flow basis.[¶](#section-6-3){.pilcrow}

For this reason, a cluster should contain all the arcs emanating from
its input nodes and all the arcs terminating at its output nodes. This
ensures that we can count all the packets (and only those) exiting an
input node again at the output node, whatever path they
follow.[¶](#section-6-4){.pilcrow}

In a completely monitored unidirectional network (a network where every
network interface is monitored), each network device corresponds to a
cluster, and each physical link corresponds to two clusters (one for
each device).[¶](#section-6-5){.pilcrow}

Clusters can have different sizes depending on the flow-filtering
criteria adopted.[¶](#section-6-6){.pilcrow}

Moreover, sometimes clusters can be optionally simplified. For example,
when two monitored interfaces are divided by a single router (one is the
input interface, the other is the output interface, and the router has
only these two interfaces), instead of counting exactly twice, upon
entering and leaving, it is possible to consider a single measurement
point. In this case, we do not care about the internal packet loss of
the router.[¶](#section-6-7){.pilcrow}

It is worth highlighting that it might also be convenient to define
clusters based on the topological information so that they are
applicable to all the possible flows in the monitored
network.[¶](#section-6-8){.pilcrow}

### [6.1.](#section-6.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Algorithm for Clusters Partition](#name-algorithm-for-clusters-part){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-algorithm-for-clusters-part}

A simple algorithm can be applied in order to split our monitoring
network into clusters. This can be done for each direction separately.
The clusters partition is based on the monitoring network graph, which
can be valid for a specific flow or can also be general and valid for
the entire network topology.[¶](#section-6.1-1){.pilcrow}

It is a two-step algorithm:[¶](#section-6.1-2){.pilcrow}

1.  [Group the links where there is the same starting
    node;[¶](#section-6.1-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.1-3.1}
2.  [Join the grouped links with at least one ending node in
    common.[¶](#section-6.1-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.1-3.2}

Considering that the links are unidirectional, the first step implies
listing all the links as connections between two nodes and grouping the
different links if they have the same starting node. Note that it is
possible to start from any link, and the procedure will work. Following
this classification, the second step implies eventually joining the
groups classified in the first step by looking at the ending nodes. If
different groups have at least one common ending node, they are put
together and belong to the same set. After the application of the two
steps of the algorithm, each one of the composed sets of links, together
with the endpoint nodes, constitutes a
cluster.[¶](#section-6.1-4){.pilcrow}

In our monitoring network graph example, it is possible to identify the
clusters partition by applying this two-step
algorithm.[¶](#section-6.1-5){.pilcrow}

The first step identifies the following
groups:[¶](#section-6.1-6){.pilcrow}

1.  [Group 1: (R1-R2), (R1-R3),
    (R1-R10)[¶](#section-6.1-7.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.1-7.1}
2.  [Group 2: (R2-R4),
    (R2-R5)[¶](#section-6.1-7.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.1-7.2}
3.  [Group 3: (R3-R5),
    (R3-R9)[¶](#section-6.1-7.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.1-7.3}
4.  [Group 4: (R4-R6),
    (R4-R7)[¶](#section-6.1-7.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.1-7.4}
5.  [Group 5: (R5-R8)[¶](#section-6.1-7.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.1-7.5}

And then, the second step builds the clusters partition (in particular,
we can underline that Groups 2 and 3 connect together, since R5 is in
common):[¶](#section-6.1-8){.pilcrow}

1.  [Cluster 1: (R1-R2), (R1-R3),
    (R1-R10)[¶](#section-6.1-9.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.1-9.1}
2.  [Cluster 2: (R2-R4), (R2-R5), (R3-R5),
    (R3-R9)[¶](#section-6.1-9.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.1-9.2}
3.  [Cluster 3: (R4-R6),
    (R4-R7)[¶](#section-6.1-9.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.1-9.3}
4.  [Cluster 4:
    (R5-R8)[¶](#section-6.1-9.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.1-9.4}

The flow direction here considered is from left to right. For the
opposite direction, the same reasoning can be applied, and in this
example, you get the same clusters
partition.[¶](#section-6.1-10){.pilcrow}

In the end, the following 4 clusters are
obtained:[¶](#section-6.1-11){.pilcrow}

There are clusters with more than two nodes as well as two-node
clusters. In the two-node clusters, the loss is on the link (Cluster 4).
In more-than-two-node clusters, the loss is on the cluster, but we
cannot know in which link (Cluster 1, 2, or
3).[¶](#section-6.1-13){.pilcrow}

In this way, the calculation of packet loss can be made on a cluster
basis. Note that the packet counters for each marking period permit
calculating the packet rate on a cluster basis, so Committed Information
Rate (CIR) and Excess Information Rate (EIR) could also be deduced on a
cluster basis.[¶](#section-6.1-14){.pilcrow}

Obviously, by combining some clusters in a new connected subnetwork
(called a \"super cluster\"), the packet-loss rule is still
true.[¶](#section-6.1-15){.pilcrow}

In this way, in a very large network, there is no need to configure
detailed filter criteria to inspect the traffic. You can check a
multipoint network and, in case of problems, go deep with a step-by-step
cluster analysis, but only for the cluster or combination of clusters
where the problem happens.[¶](#section-6.1-16){.pilcrow}

In summary, once a flow is defined, the algorithm to build the clusters
partition is based on topological information; therefore, it considers
all the possible links and nodes crossed by the given flow, even if
there is no traffic. So, if the flow does not enter or traverse all the
nodes, the counters have a nonzero value for the involved nodes and a
zero value for the other nodes without traffic; but in the end, all the
formulas are still valid.[¶](#section-6.1-17){.pilcrow}

The algorithm described above is an iterative clustering algorithm, but
it is also possible to apply a recursive clustering algorithm by using
the node-node adjacency matrix representation

It is important to consider the timing aspects, since out-of-order
packets happen and have to be handled as well, as described in [RFC
8321](#RFC8321){.xref} \[[RFC8321](#RFC8321){.xref}\]. However, in a
multisource situation, an additional issue has to be considered. With
multipoint path, the egress nodes will receive alternate marked packets
in random order from different ingress nodes, and this must not affect
the measurement.[¶](#section-7-1){.pilcrow}

So, if we analyze a multipoint-to-multipoint path with more than one
marking node, it is important to recognize the reference measurement
interval. In general, the measurement interval for describing the
results is the interval of the marking node that is more aligned with
the start of the measurement, as reported in [Figure

8321](#RFC8321){.xref} \[[RFC8321](#RFC8321){.xref}\] already describes
two contributions that are taken into account: the clock error between
network devices and the network delay between measurement
points.[¶](#section-7-7){.pilcrow}

But we should now consider an additional contribution. Since all source
nodes mark the traffic, the source measurement intervals can be of
different lengths and with different offsets, and this mismatch m can be
added to d, as shown in [Figure
5](#mtiming){.xref}.[¶](#section-7-8){.pilcrow}

So the misalignment between the marking source routers gives an
additional constraint, and the value of m is added to d (which already
includes clock error and network delay).[¶](#section-7-10){.pilcrow}

Thus, three different possible contributions are considered: clock error
between network devices, network delay between measurement points, and
the misalignment between the marking source
routers.[¶](#section-7-11){.pilcrow}

In the end, the condition that must be satisfied to enable the method to
function properly is that the available counting interval must be \> 0,
and that means:[¶](#section-7-12){.pilcrow}

L - 2m - 2d \> 0.[¶](#section-7-13){.pilcrow}

This formula needs to be verified for each measurement point on the
multipoint path, where m is misalignment between the marking source
routers, while d, already introduced in [RFC 8321](#RFC8321){.xref}
\[[RFC8321](#RFC8321){.xref}\], takes into account clock error and
network delay between network nodes. Therefore, the mismatch between
measurement intervals must satisfy this
condition.[¶](#section-7-14){.pilcrow}

Note that the timing considerations are valid for both packet loss and
delay measurements.[¶](#section-7-15){.pilcrow}

The same line of reasoning can be applied to delay and delay variation.
Similarly to the delay measurements defined in [RFC
8321](#RFC8321){.xref} \[[RFC8321](#RFC8321){.xref}\], the marking
batches anchor the samples to a particular period, and this is the time
reference that can be used. It is important to highlight that both delay
and delay-variation measurements make sense in a multipoint path. The
delay variation is calculated by considering the same packets selected
for measuring the delay.[¶](#section-8-1){.pilcrow}

In general, it is possible to perform delay and delay-variation
measurements on the basis of multipoint paths or single
packets:[¶](#section-8-2){.pilcrow}

-   [Delay measurements on the basis of multipoint paths mean that the
    delay value is representative of an entire multipoint path (e.g.,

to the case of multipoint flows. It is possible to compute the average
one-way delay of packets in one block, a cluster, or the entire
monitored network.[¶](#section-8.1.1-1){.pilcrow}

The average latency can be measured as the difference between the
weighted averages of the mean timestamps of the sets of output and input

Delay and delay-variation measurements relative to only one picked
packet per period (both single and double marked) can be performed in
the multipoint scenario, with some
limitations:[¶](#section-8.2.1-1){.pilcrow}

-   [Single marking based on the first/last packet of the interval would
    not work, because it would not be possible to agree on the first
    packet of the
    interval.[¶](#section-8.2.1-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-8.2.1-2.1}
-   [Double marking or multiplexed marking would work, but each
    measurement would only give information about the delay of a single
    path. However, by repeating the measurement multiple times, it is
    possible to get information about all the paths in the multipoint
    flow. This can be done in the case of a point-to-multipoint path,
    but it is more difficult to achieve in the case of a
    multipoint-to-multipoint path because of the multiple source
    routers.[¶](#section-8.2.1-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-8.2.1-2.2}

If we would perform a delay measurement for more than one picked packet
in the same marking period, and especially if we want to get delay
measurements on a multipoint-to-multipoint basis, neither the single-
nor the double-marking method is useful in the multipoint scenario,
since they would not be representative of the entire flow. The packets
can follow different paths with various delays, and in general it can be
very difficult to recognize marked packets in a multipoint-to-multipoint
path, especially in the case when there is more than one per
period.[¶](#section-8.2.1-3){.pilcrow}

A desirable option is to monitor simultaneously all the paths of a
multipoint path in the same marking period; for this purpose, hashing
can be used, as reported in the next
section.[¶](#section-8.2.1-4){.pilcrow}

[5475](#RFC5475){.xref} \[[RFC5475](#RFC5475){.xref}\] introduce
sampling and filtering techniques for IP packet
selection.[¶](#section-8.2.2-1){.pilcrow}

The hash-based selection methodologies for delay measurement can work in
a multipoint-to-multipoint path and can be used either coupled to mean
delay or stand-alone.[¶](#section-8.2.2-2){.pilcrow}

\[[ALTERNATE-MARKING](#I-D.mizrahi-ippm-compact-alternate-marking){.xref}\]
introduces how to use the hash method (RFCs [5474](#RFC5474){.xref}
\[[RFC5474](#RFC5474){.xref}\] and [5475](#RFC5475){.xref}
\[[RFC5475](#RFC5475){.xref}\]) combined with the Alternate-Marking
method for point-to-point flows. It is also called Mixed Hashed Marking:
the coupling of a marking method and hashing technique is very useful,
because the marking batches anchor the samples selected with hashing,
and this simplifies the correlation of the hashing packets along the
path.[¶](#section-8.2.2-3){.pilcrow}

It is possible to use a basic-hash or a dynamic-hash method. One of the
challenges of the basic approach is that the frequency of the sampled
packets may vary considerably. For this reason, the dynamic approach has
been introduced for point-to-point flows in order to have the desired
and almost fixed number of samples for each measurement period. Using
the hash-based sampling, the number of samples may vary a lot because it
depends on the packet rate that is variable. The dynamic approach helps
to have an almost fixed number of samples for each marking period, and
this is a better option for making regular measurements over time. In
the hash-based sampling, Alternate Marking is used to create periods, so
that hash-based samples are divided into batches, which allows anchoring
the selected samples to their period. Moreover, in the dynamic
hash-based sampling, by dynamically adapting the length of the hash
value, the number of samples is bounded in each marking period. This can
be realized by choosing the maximum number of samples (NMAX) to be
caught in a marking period. The algorithm starts with only a few hash
bits, which permits selecting a greater percentage of packets (e.g.,
with 0 bits of hash all the packets are sampled, with 1 bit of hash half
of the packets are sampled, and so on). When the number of selected
packets reaches NMAX, a hashing bit is added. As a consequence, the
sampling proceeds at half of the original rate, and also the packets
already selected that do not match the new hash are discarded. This step
can be repeated iteratively. It is assumed that each sample includes the
timestamp (used for delay measurement) and the hash value, allowing the
management system to match the samples received from the two measurement
points. The dynamic process statistically converges at the end of a
marking period, and the final number of selected samples is between
NMAX/2 and NMAX. Therefore, the dynamic approach paces the sampling
rate, allowing to bound the number of sampled packets per sampling
period.[¶](#section-8.2.2-4){.pilcrow}

In a multipoint environment, the behavior is similar to a point-to-point
flow. In particular, in the context of a multipoint-to-multipoint flow,
the dynamic hash could be the solution for performing delay measurements
on specific packets and overcoming the single- and double-marking
limitations.[¶](#section-8.2.2-5){.pilcrow}

The management system receives the samples, including the timestamps and
the hash value, from all the MPs, and this happens for both
point-to-point and multipoint-to-multipoint flows. Then, the longest
hash used by the MPs is deduced and applied to couple timestamps from
either the same packets of 2 MPs of a point-to-point path, or the input
and output MPs of a cluster (or a super cluster or the entire network).
But some considerations are needed: if there isn\'t packet loss, the set
of input samples is always equal to the set of output samples. In the
case of packet loss, the set of output samples can be a subset of input
samples, but the method still works because, at the end, it is easy to
couple the input and output timestamps of each caught packet using the
hash (in particular, the \"unused part of the hash\" that should be
different for each packet).[¶](#section-8.2.2-6){.pilcrow}

Therefore, the basic hash is logically similar to the double-marking
method, and in the case of a point-to-point path, double-marking and
basic-hash selection are equivalent. The dynamic approach scales the
number of measurements per interval. It would seem that double marking
would also work well if we reduced the interval length, but this can be
done only for a point-to-point path and not for a multipoint path, where
we cannot couple the picked packets in a multipoint path. So, in
general, if we want to get delay measurements on the basis of a
multipoint-to-multipoint path, and want to select more than one packet
per period, double marking cannot be used because we could not be able
to couple the picked packets between input and output nodes. On the
other hand, we can do that by using hashing
selection.[¶](#section-8.2.2-7){.pilcrow}

## [9.](#section-9){.section-number .selfRef} [A Closed-Loop Performance-Management Approach](#name-a-closed-loop-performance-m){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-a-closed-loop-performance-m}

The Multipoint Alternate-Marking framework that is introduced in this
document adds flexibility to Performance Management (PM), because it can
reduce the order of magnitude of the packet counters. This allows an SDN
orchestrator to supervise, control, and manage PM in large
networks.[¶](#section-9-1){.pilcrow}

The monitoring network can be considered as a whole or split into
clusters that are the smallest subnetworks (group-to-group segments),
maintaining the packet-loss property for each subnetwork. The clusters
can also be combined in new, connected subnetworks at different levels,
depending on the detail we want to achieve.[¶](#section-9-2){.pilcrow}

An SDN controller or a Network Management System (NMS) can calibrate
performance measurements, since they are aware of the network topology.
They can start without examining in depth. In case of necessity (packet
loss is measured or the delay is too high), the filtering criteria could
be immediately reconfigured in order to perform a partition of the
network by using clusters and/or different combinations of clusters. In
this way, the problem can be localized in a specific cluster or a single
combination of clusters, and a more detailed analysis can be performed
step by step by successive approximation up to a point-to-point flow
detailed analysis. This is the so-called \"closed
loop\".[¶](#section-9-3){.pilcrow}

This approach can be called \"network zooming\" and can be performed in
two different ways:[¶](#section-9-4){.pilcrow}

1\) change the traffic filter and select more detailed
flows;[¶](#section-9-5){.pilcrow}

2\) activate new measurement points by defining more specified
clusters.[¶](#section-9-6){.pilcrow}

The network-zooming approach implies that some filters or rules are
changed and that therefore there is a transient time to wait once the
new network configuration takes effect. This time can be determined by
the Network Orchestrator/Controller, based on the network
conditions.[¶](#section-9-7){.pilcrow}

For example, if the network zooming identifies the performance problem
for the traffic coming from a specific source, we need to recognize the
marked signal from this specific source node and its relative path. For
this purpose, we can activate all the available measurement points and
better specify the flow filter criteria (i.e., 5-tuple). As an
alternative, it can be enough to select packets from the specific source
for delay measurements; in this case, it is possible to apply the
hashing technique, as mentioned in the previous
sections.[¶](#section-9-8){.pilcrow}

\[[IFIT-FRAMEWORK](#I-D.song-opsawg-ifit-framework){.xref}\] defines an
architecture where the centralized Data Collector and Network Management
can apply the intelligent and flexible Alternate-Marking algorithm as
previously described.[¶](#section-9-9){.pilcrow}

As for [RFC 8321](#RFC8321){.xref} \[[RFC8321](#RFC8321){.xref}\], it is
possible to classify the traffic and mark a portion of the total
traffic. For each period, the packet rate and bandwidth are calculated
from the number of packets. In this way, the network orchestrator
becomes aware if the traffic rate surpasses limits. In addition, more
precision can be obtained by reducing the marking period; indeed, some
implementations use a marking period of 1 sec or
less.[¶](#section-9-10){.pilcrow}

In addition, an SDN controller could also collect the measurement
history.[¶](#section-9-11){.pilcrow}

It is important to mention that the Multipoint Alternate Marking
framework also helps Traffic Visualization. Indeed, this methodology is
very useful for identifying which path or cluster is crossed by the
flow.[¶](#section-9-12){.pilcrow}

VPN:
:   The IP traffic is selected on an IP-source basis in both directions.
    At the endpoint WAN interface, all the output traffic is counted in
    a single flow. The input traffic is composed of all the other flows
    aggregated for source address. So, by considering n endpoints, the
    monitored flows are n (each flow with 1 ingress point and (n-1)
    egress points) instead of n\*(n-1) flows (each flow, with 1 ingress
    point and 1 egress point).[¶](#section-10-2.2){.pilcrow}
:   

Mobile Backhaul:
:   LTE traffic is selected, in the Up direction, by the EnodeB source
    address and, in the Down direction, by the EnodeB destination
    address, because the packets are sent from the Mobile Packet Core to
    the EnodeB. So the monitored flow is only one per EnodeB in both
    directions.[¶](#section-10-2.4){.pilcrow}
:   

Over The Top (OTT) services:
:   The traffic is selected, in the Down direction, by the source
    addresses of the packets sent by OTT servers. In the opposite
    direction (Up), it is selected by the destination IP addresses of
    the same servers. So the monitoring is based on a single flow per
    OTT server in both directions.[¶](#section-10-2.6){.pilcrow}
:   

Enterprise SD-WAN:
:   SD-WAN allows connecting remote branch offices to data centers and
    building higher-performance WANs. A centralized controller is used
    to set policies and prioritize traffic. The SD-WAN takes into
    account these policies and the availability of network bandwidth to
    route traffic. This helps ensure that application performance meets
    Service Level Agreements (SLAs). This methodology can also help the
    path selection for the WAN connection based on per-cluster and
    per-flow performance.[¶](#section-10-2.8){.pilcrow}
