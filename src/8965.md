Babel \[[RFC8966](#RFC8966){.xref}\] is a routing protocol based on the
familiar distance-vector algorithm (sometimes known as distributed
Bellman-Ford) augmented with mechanisms for loop avoidance (there is no
\"counting to infinity\") and starvation avoidance. This document
describes a number of niches where Babel is useful and that are arguably
not adequately served by more mature protocols such as OSPF
\[[RFC5340](#RFC5340){.xref}\] and IS-IS
\[[RFC1195](#RFC1195){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-1.1 .section}
### [1.1.](#section-1.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Technical Overview of the Babel Protocol](#name-technical-overview-of-the-b){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-technical-overview-of-the-b}

At its core, Babel is a distance-vector protocol based on the
distributed Bellman-Ford algorithm, similar in principle to RIP
\[[RFC2453](#RFC2453){.xref}\] but with two important extensions:
provisions for sensing of neighbour reachability, bidirectional
reachability, and link quality, and support for multiple address
families (e.g., IPv6 and IPv4) in a single protocol
instance.[¶](#section-1.1-1){.pilcrow}

Algorithms of this class are simple to understand and simple to
implement, but unfortunately they do not work very well \-- they suffer
from \"counting to infinity\", a case of pathologically slow convergence
in some topologies after a link failure. Babel uses a mechanism
pioneered by the Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP)
\[[DUAL](#DUAL){.xref}\] \[[RFC7868](#RFC7868){.xref}\], known as
\"feasibility\", which avoids routing loops and therefore makes counting
to infinity impossible.[¶](#section-1.1-2){.pilcrow}

Feasibility is a conservative mechanism, one that not only avoids all
looping routes but also rejects some loop-free routes. Thus, it can lead
to a situation known as \"starvation\", where a router rejects all
routes to a given destination, even those that are loop-free. In order
to recover from starvation, Babel uses a mechanism pioneered by the
Destination-Sequenced Distance-Vector Routing Protocol (DSDV)
\[[DSDV](#DSDV){.xref}\] and known as \"sequenced routes\". In Babel,
this mechanism is generalised to deal with prefixes of arbitrary length
and routes announced at multiple points in a single routing domain (DSDV
was a pure mesh protocol, and only carried host
routes).[¶](#section-1.1-3){.pilcrow}

In DSDV, the sequenced routes algorithm is slow to react to a starvation
episode. In Babel, starvation recovery is accelerated by using explicit
requests (known as \"seqno requests\" in the protocol) that signal a
starvation episode and cause a new sequenced route to be propagated in a
timely manner. In the absence of packet loss, this mechanism is provably
complete and clears the starvation in time proportional to the diameter
of the network, at the cost of some additional signalling
traffic.[¶](#section-1.1-4){.pilcrow}

This section describes the properties of the Babel protocol as well as
its known limitations.[¶](#section-2-1){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-2.1 .section}
### [2.1.](#section-2.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Simplicity and Implementability](#name-simplicity-and-implementabi){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-simplicity-and-implementabi}

Babel is a conceptually simple protocol. It consists of a familiar
algorithm (distributed Bellman-Ford) augmented with three simple and
well-defined mechanisms (feasibility, sequenced routes, and explicit
requests). Given a sufficiently friendly audience, the principles behind
Babel can be explained in 15 minutes, and a full description of the
protocol can be done in 52 minutes (one
microcentury).[¶](#section-2.1-1){.pilcrow}

An important consequence is that Babel is easy to implement. At the time
of writing, there exist four independent, interoperable implementations,
including one that was reportedly written and debugged in just two
nights.[¶](#section-2.1-2){.pilcrow}
:::

::: {#section-2.2 .section}
### [2.2.](#section-2.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Robustness](#name-robustness){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-robustness}

The fairly strong properties of the Babel protocol (convergence, loop
avoidance, and starvation avoidance) rely on some reasonably weak
properties of the network and the metric being used. The most
significant are:[¶](#section-2.2-1){.pilcrow}

-   [[]{.break}]{#section-2.2-2.1}

    causality:
    :   the \"happens-before\" relation is acyclic (intuitively, a
        control message is not received before it has been
        sent);[¶](#section-2.2-2.1.1.2){.pilcrow}
    :   

    strict monotonicity of the metric:
    :   for any metric M and link cost C, M \< C + M (intuitively, this
        implies that cycles have a strictly positive
        metric);[¶](#section-2.2-2.1.1.4){.pilcrow}
    :   

    left-distributivity of the metric:
    :   for any metrics M and M\' and cost C, if M \<= M\', then
        C + M \<= C + M\' (intuitively, this implies that a good choice
        made by a neighbour B of a node A is also a good choice for
        A).[¶](#section-2.2-2.1.1.6){.pilcrow}
    :   

See \[[METAROUTING](#METAROUTING){.xref}\] for more information about
these properties and their consequences.[¶](#section-2.2-3){.pilcrow}

In particular, Babel does not assume a reliable transport, it does not
assume ordered delivery, it does not assume that communication is
transitive, and it does not require that the metric be discrete
(continuous metrics are possible, for example, reflecting packet loss
rates). This is in contrast to link-state routing protocols such as OSPF
\[[RFC5340](#RFC5340){.xref}\] or IS-IS \[[RFC1195](#RFC1195){.xref}\],
which incorporate a reliable flooding algorithm and make stronger
requirements on the underlying network and
metric.[¶](#section-2.2-4){.pilcrow}

These weak requirements make Babel a robust
protocol:[¶](#section-2.2-5){.pilcrow}

-   [[]{.break}]{#section-2.2-6.1}

    robust with respect to unusual networks:
    :   an unusual network (non-transitive links, unstable link costs,
        etc.) is likely not to violate the assumptions of the
        protocol;[¶](#section-2.2-6.1.1.2){.pilcrow}
    :   

    robust with respect to novel metrics:
    :   an unusual metric (continuous, constantly fluctuating, etc.) is
        likely not to violate the assumptions of the
        protocol.[¶](#section-2.2-6.1.1.4){.pilcrow}
    :   

[Section 3](#successful){.xref} gives examples of successful deployments
of Babel that illustrate these properties.[¶](#section-2.2-7){.pilcrow}

These robustness properties have important consequences for the
applicability of the protocol: Babel works (more or less efficiently) in
a range of circumstances where traditional routing protocols don\'t work
well (or at all).[¶](#section-2.2-8){.pilcrow}
:::

::: {#section-2.3 .section}
### [2.3.](#section-2.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Extensibility](#name-extensibility){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-extensibility}

Babel\'s packet format has a number of features that make the protocol
extensible (see [Appendix
D](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8966#appendix-D){.relref} of
\[[RFC8966](#RFC8966){.xref}\]), and a number of extensions have been
designed to make Babel work better in situations that were not
envisioned when the protocol was initially designed. The ease of
extensibility is not an accident, but a consequence of the design of the
protocol: it is reasonably easy to check whether a given extension
violates the assumptions on which Babel
relies.[¶](#section-2.3-1){.pilcrow}

All of the extensions designed to date interoperate with the base
protocol and with each other. This, again, is a consequence of the
protocol design: in order to check that two extensions to the Babel
protocol are interoperable, it is enough to verify that the interaction
of the two does not violate the base protocol\'s
assumptions.[¶](#section-2.3-2){.pilcrow}

Notable extensions deployed to date
include:[¶](#section-2.3-3){.pilcrow}

-   [source-specific routing (also known as Source-Address Dependent
    Routing, SADR)
    \[[BABEL-SS](#I-D.ietf-babel-source-specific){.xref}\] allows
    forwarding to take a packet\'s source address into account, thus
    enabling a cheap form of multihoming
    \[[SS-ROUTING](#SS-ROUTING){.xref}\];[¶](#section-2.3-4.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.3-4.1}
-   [RTT-based routing
    \[[BABEL-RTT](#I-D.jonglez-babel-rtt-extension){.xref}\] minimises
    link delay, which is useful in overlay network (where both hop count
    and packet loss are poor
    metrics).[¶](#section-2.3-4.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.3-4.2}

Some other extensions have been designed but have not seen deployment in
production (and their usefulness is yet to be
demonstrated):[¶](#section-2.3-5){.pilcrow}

-   [frequency-aware routing
    \[[BABEL-Z](#I-D.chroboczek-babel-diversity-routing){.xref}\] aims
    to minimise radio interference in wireless
    networks;[¶](#section-2.3-6.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.3-6.1}
-   [ToS-aware routing
    \[[BABEL-TOS](#I-D.chouasne-babel-tos-specific){.xref}\] allows
    routing to take a packet\'s Type of Service (ToS) marking into
    account for selected routes without incurring the full cost of a
    multi-topology routing
    protocol.[¶](#section-2.3-6.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.3-6.2}
:::

::: {#section-2.4 .section}
### [2.4.](#section-2.4){.section-number .selfRef} [Limitations](#name-limitations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-limitations}

Babel has some undesirable properties that make it suboptimal or even
unusable in some deployments.[¶](#section-2.4-1){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-2.4.1 .section}
#### [2.4.1.](#section-2.4.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Periodic Updates](#name-periodic-updates){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-periodic-updates}

The main mechanisms used by Babel to reconverge after a topology change
are reactive: triggered updates, triggered retractions and explicit
requests. However, Babel relies on periodic updates to clear pathologies
after a mobility event or in the presence of heavy packet loss. The use
of periodic updates makes Babel unsuitable in at least two kinds of
environments:[¶](#section-2.4.1-1){.pilcrow}

-   [[]{.break}]{#section-2.4.1-2.1}

    large, stable networks:
    :   since Babel sends periodic updates even in the absence of
        topology changes, in well-managed, large, stable networks the
        amount of control traffic will be reduced by using a protocol
        that uses a reliable transport (such as OSPF, IS-IS, or
        EIGRP);[¶](#section-2.4.1-2.1.1.2){.pilcrow}
    :   

    low-power networks:
    :   the periodic updates use up battery power even when there are no
        topology changes and no user traffic, which makes Babel wasteful
        in low-power networks.[¶](#section-2.4.1-2.1.1.4){.pilcrow}

#### [2.4.2.](#section-2.4.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Full Routing Table](#name-full-routing-table){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-full-routing-table}

While there exist techniques that allow a Babel speaker to function with
a partial routing table (e.g., by learning just a default route or, more
generally, performing route aggregation), Babel is designed around the
assumption that every router has a full routing table. In networks where
some nodes are too constrained to hold a full routing table, it might be
preferable to use a protocol that was designed from the outset to work
with a partial routing table (such as the Ad hoc On-Demand Distance
Vector (AODV) routing protocol \[[RFC3561](#RFC3561){.xref}\], the IPv6
Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL)
\[[RFC6550](#RFC6550){.xref}\], or the Lightweight On-demand Ad hoc
Distance-vector Routing Protocol - Next Generation (LOADng)
\[[LOADng](#I-D.clausen-lln-loadng){.xref}\]).[¶](#section-2.4.2-1){.pilcrow}

#### [2.4.3.](#section-2.4.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Slow Aggregation](#name-slow-aggregation){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-slow-aggregation}

Babel\'s loop-avoidance mechanism relies on making a route unreachable
after a retraction until all neighbours have been guaranteed to have
acted upon the retraction, even in the presence of packet loss. Unless
the second algorithm described in [Section
3.5.5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8966#section-3.5.5){.relref} of
\[[RFC8966](#RFC8966){.xref}\] is implemented, this entails that a node
is unreachable for a few minutes after the most specific route to it has
been retracted. This delay makes Babel slow to recover from a topology
change in networks that perform automatic route
aggregation.[¶](#section-2.4.3-1){.pilcrow}

### [3.1.](#section-3.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Heterogeneous Networks](#name-heterogeneous-networks){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-heterogeneous-networks}

Babel is able to deal with both classical, prefix-based
(\"Internet-style\") routing and flat (\"mesh-style\") routing over
non-transitive link technologies. Just like traditional distance-vector
protocols, Babel is able to carry prefixes of arbitrary length, to
suppress redundant announcements by applying the split-horizon
optimisation where applicable, and can be configured to filter out
redundant announcements (manual aggregation). Just like specialised mesh
protocols, Babel doesn\'t by default assume that links are transitive or
symmetric, can dynamically compute metrics based on an estimation of
link quality, and carries large numbers of host routes efficiently by
omitting common prefixes.[¶](#section-3.1-1){.pilcrow}

Because of these properties, Babel has seen a number of successful
deployments in medium-sized heterogeneous networks, networks that
combine a wired, aggregated backbone with meshy wireless bits at the
edges.[¶](#section-3.1-2){.pilcrow}

Efficient operation in heterogeneous networks requires the
implementation to distinguish between wired and wireless links, and to
perform link quality estimation on wireless
links.[¶](#section-3.1-3){.pilcrow}

### [3.2.](#section-3.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Large-Scale Overlay Networks](#name-large-scale-overlay-network){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-large-scale-overlay-network}

The algorithms used by Babel (loop avoidance, hysteresis, delayed
updates) allow it to remain stable in the presence of unstable metrics,
even in the presence of a feedback loop. For this reason, it has been
successfully deployed in large-scale overlay networks, built out of
thousands of tunnels spanning continents, where it is used with a metric
computed from links\' latencies.[¶](#section-3.2-1){.pilcrow}

This particular application depends on the extension for RTT-sensitive
routing

### [3.3.](#section-3.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Pure Mesh Networks](#name-pure-mesh-networks){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-pure-mesh-networks}

While Babel is a general-purpose routing protocol, it has been shown to
be competitive with dedicated routing protocols for wireless mesh
networks \[[REAL-WORLD](#REAL-WORLD){.xref}\]
\[[BRIDGING-LAYERS](#BRIDGING-LAYERS){.xref}\]. Although this particular
niche is already served by a number of mature protocols, notably the
Optimized Link State Routing Protocol with Expected Transmission Count
(OLSR-ETX) and OLSRv2 (OLSR Version 2) \[[RFC7181](#RFC7181){.xref}\]
(equipped e.g., with the Directional Airtime (DAT) metric
\[[RFC7779](#RFC7779){.xref}\]), Babel has seen a moderate amount of
successful deployment in pure mesh
networks.[¶](#section-3.3-1){.pilcrow}

### [3.4.](#section-3.4){.section-number .selfRef} [Small Unmanaged Networks](#name-small-unmanaged-networks){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-small-unmanaged-networks}

Because of its small size and simple configuration, Babel has been
deployed in small, unmanaged networks (e.g., home and small office
networks), where it serves as a more efficient replacement for RIP
\[[RFC2453](#RFC2453){.xref}\], over which it has two significant
advantages: the ability to route multiple address families (IPv6 and
IPv4) in a single protocol instance and good support for using wireless
links for transit.[¶](#section-3.4-1){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-4 .section}
## [4.](#section-4){.section-number .selfRef} [Security Considerations](#name-security-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-security-considerations}

As is the case in all distance-vector routing protocols, a Babel speaker
receives reachability information from its neighbours, which by default
is trusted by all nodes in the routing
domain.[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

At the time of writing, the Babel protocol is usually run over a network
that is secured either at the physical layer (e.g., physically
protecting Ethernet sockets) or at the link layer (using a protocol such
as Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 (WPA2)). If Babel is being run over an
unprotected network, then the routing traffic needs to be protected
using a sufficiently strong cryptographic
mechanism.[¶](#section-4-2){.pilcrow}

At the time of writing, two such mechanisms have been defined. Message
Authentication Code (MAC) authentication for Babel (Babel-MAC)
\[[RFC8967](#RFC8967){.xref}\] is a simple and easy to implement
mechanism that only guarantees authenticity, integrity, and replay
protection of the routing traffic and only supports symmetric keying
with a small number of keys (typically just one or two). Babel-DTLS
\[[RFC8968](#RFC8968){.xref}\] is a more complex mechanism that requires
some minor changes to be made to a typical Babel implementation and
depends on a DTLS stack being available, but inherits all of the
features of DTLS, notably confidentiality, optional replay protection,
and the ability to use asymmetric keys.[¶](#section-4-3){.pilcrow}

Due to its simplicity, Babel-MAC should be the preferred security
mechanism in most deployments, with Babel-DTLS available for networks
that require its additional features.[¶](#section-4-4){.pilcrow}

In addition to the above, the information that a mobile Babel node
announces to the whole routing domain is often sufficient to determine a
mobile node\'s physical location with reasonable precision. This might
make Babel unapplicable in scenarios where a node\'s location is
considered confidential.[¶](#section-4-5){.pilcrow}
