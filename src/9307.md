## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

The \"Show me the numbers: Workshop on Analyzing IETF Data (AID)\"
workshop was convened by the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) from
November 29 to December 2, 2021 and hosted by the IN-SIGHT.it project at
the University of Amsterdam; however, it was converted to an online-only
event. The workshop was organized into two discussion parts with a
hackathon activity in between. This report summarizes the workshop\'s
discussion and identifies topics that warrant future work and
consideration.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

The IETF, as an international Standards Developing Organization (SDO),
hosts a diverse set of data about the IETF\'s history and development,
current standardization activities, Internet protocols, and the
institutions that comprise the IETF. A large portion of this data is
publicly available, yet it is underutilized as a tool to inform the work
in the IETF or the broader research community that is focused on topics
like Internet governance and trends in information and communication
technologies (ICT) standard setting.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

The aim of the \"IAB Workshop on Analyzing IETF Data (AID) 2021\"
workshop was to study how IETF data is currently used, to understand
what insights can be drawn from that data, and to explore open questions
around how that data may be further used in the
future.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

These questions can inform a research agenda drawing from IETF data that
fosters further collaborative work among interested parties, ranging
from academia and civil society to industry and IETF
leadership.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

## [2.](#section-2){.section-number .selfRef} [Workshop Scope and Discussion](#name-workshop-scope-and-discussi){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-workshop-scope-and-discussi}

The workshop was organized with two all-group discussion slots at the
beginning and the end of the workshop. In between, the workshop
participants organized hackathon activities based on topics identified
during the initial discussion and in submitted position papers. The
following topic areas were identified and
discussed.[¶](#section-2-1){.pilcrow}

::: {#tools-data-and-methods}
::: {#section-2.1 .section}
### [2.1.](#section-2.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Tools, Data, and Methods](#name-tools-data-and-methods){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-tools-data-and-methods}

The IETF holds a wide range of data sources. The main ones used are the
[mailinglist archives](#Mail-Arch){.internal .xref}
\[[Mail-Arch](#Mail-Arch){.cite .xref}\], [RFCs](#IETF-RFCs){.internal
.xref} \[[IETF-RFCs](#IETF-RFCs){.cite .xref}\], and [the
datatracker](#Datatracker){.internal .xref}
\[[Datatracker](#Datatracker){.cite .xref}\]. The latter provides
information on participants, authors, meeting proceedings, minutes, [and
more](#Data-Overview){.internal .xref}
\[[Data-Overview](#Data-Overview){.cite .xref}\]. Furthermore, there are
[statistics for the IETF websites](#IETF-Statistics){.internal .xref}
\[[IETF-Statistics](#IETF-Statistics){.cite .xref}\], the working group
Github repositories, and the IETF [survey data](#Survey-Data){.internal
.xref} \[[Survey-Data](#Survey-Data){.cite .xref}\]. There was
discussion about the utility of download statistics for the RFCs
themselves from different repos.[¶](#section-2.1-1){.pilcrow}

There is a wide range of tools to analyze this data produced by IETF
participants or researchers interested in the work of the IETF. Two
projects that presented their work at the workshop were
[BigBang](#BigBang){.internal .xref} \[[BigBang](#BigBang){.cite
.xref}\] and Sodestream\'s [IETFdata](#ietfdata){.internal .xref}
\[[ietfdata](#ietfdata){.cite .xref}\] library. The RFC Prolog Database
was described in a submitted paper; see
\[[Prolog-Database](#Prolog-Database){.cite .xref}\]. These projects
could provide additional insight into existing [IETF
statistics](#ArkkoStats){.internal .xref}
\[[ArkkoStats](#ArkkoStats){.cite .xref}\] and [datatracker
statistics](#DatatrackerStats){.internal .xref}
\[[DatatrackerStats](#DatatrackerStats){.cite .xref}\], e.g.,
gender-related information. Privacy issues and the implications of
making such data publicly available were discussed as
well.[¶](#section-2.1-2){.pilcrow}

The datatracker itself is a community tool that welcomes contributions;
for example, for additions to the existing interfaces or the statistics
page directly, see the [Datatracker Database
Overview](#Data-Overview){.internal .xref}
\[[Data-Overview](#Data-Overview){.cite .xref}\]. At the time of the
workshop, instructions about how to set up a local development
environment could be found at [IAB AID Workshop Data
Resources](#DataResources){.internal .xref}
\[[DataResources](#DataResources){.cite .xref}\]. Questions or
discussion about the datatracker and possible enhancements can be sent
to tools-discuss\@ietf.org.[¶](#section-2.1-3){.pilcrow}

### [2.2.](#section-2.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Observations on Affiliation and Industry Control](#name-observations-on-affiliation){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-observations-on-affiliation}

A large portion of the submitted position papers indicated interest in
researching questions about industry control in the standardization
process (as opposed to individual contributions in a personal capacity),
where industry control covers both a) technical contributions and the
ability to successfully standardize these contributions and b)
competition on leadership roles. To assess these questions,
investigating participant affiliations, including \"indirect\"
affiliations (e.g., by tracking funding and changes in affiliation) was
discussed. The need to model company characteristics or stakeholder
groups was also discussed.[¶](#section-2.2-1){.pilcrow}

Discussion about the analysis of IETF data shows that affiliation
dynamics are hard to capture due to the specifics of how the data is
entered and because of larger social dynamics. On the side of IETF data
capture, affiliation is an open text field that causes people to write
their affiliation down in different ways (e.g., capitalization, space,
word separation, etc). A common data format could contribute to analyses
that compare SDO performance and behavior of actors inside and across
standards bodies. To help with this, a draft data model was developed
during the hackathon portion of the workshop; the data model can be
found in [Appendix A](#appendix-a){.auto .internal
.xref}.[¶](#section-2.2-2){.pilcrow}

Furthermore, there is the issue of mergers, acquisitions, and subsidiary
companies. There is no authoritative exogenous source of variation for
affiliation changes, so hand-collected and curated data is used to
analyze changes in affiliation over time. While this approach is
imperfect, conclusions can be drawn from the data. For example, in the
case of mergers or acquisition where a small organization joins a large
organization, this results in a statistically significant increase in
likelihood of an individual being put in a working group chair position
(see the document by [Baron and
Kanevskaia](#LEADERSHIP-POSITIONS){.internal .xref}
\[[LEADERSHIP-POSITIONS](#LEADERSHIP-POSITIONS){.cite
.xref}\]).[¶](#section-2.2-3){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-2.3 .section}
### [2.3.](#section-2.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Community and Diversity](#name-community-and-diversity){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-community-and-diversity}

The workshop participants were highly interested in using existing data
to better understand who the current IETF community is. They were also
interested in the community\'s diversity and how to potentially increase
it and thereby increase inclusivity, e.g., understanding if there are
certain factors that \"drive people away\" and why. Inclusivity and
transparency about the standardization process are generally important
to keep the Internet and its development process viable. As commented
during the workshop discussion, when measuring and evaluating different
angles of diversity, it is also important to understand the actual goals
that are intended when increasing diversity, e.g., in order to increase
competence (mainly technical diversity from different companies and
stakeholder groups) or relevance (also regional diversity and
international footprint).[¶](#section-2.3-1){.pilcrow}

The discussion on community and diversity spanned from methods that draw
from novel text mining, time series clustering, graph mining, and
psycholinguistic approaches to understand the consensus mechanism to
more speculative approaches about what it would take to build a feminist
Internet. The discussion also covered the data needed to measure who is
in the community and how diverse it is.[¶](#section-2.3-2){.pilcrow}

The discussion highlighted that part of the challenge is defining what
diversity means and how to measure it, or as one participant
highlighted, defining \"who the average IETFer is\". There was a
question about what to do about missing data or non-participating or
underrepresented communities, like women, individuals from the African
continent, and network operators. In terms of how IETF data is
structured, various researchers mentioned that it is hard to track
conversations because mail threads split, merge, and change. The
ICANN-at-large model came up as an example of how to involve relevant
stakeholders in the IETF that are currently not present. Conversely, it
is also interesting for outside communities (especially policy makers)
to get a sense of who the IETF community is and keep them
updated.[¶](#section-2.3-3){.pilcrow}

The human element of the community and diversity was highlighted. In
order to understand the IETF community\'s diversity, it is important to
talk to people (beyond text analysis). In order to ensure inclusivity,
individual participants must make an effort to, as one participant
recounted, tell them their participation is
valuable.[¶](#section-2.3-4){.pilcrow}

### [2.4.](#section-2.4){.section-number .selfRef} [Publications, Process, and Decision Making](#name-publications-process-and-de){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-publications-process-and-de}

A number of submissions focused on the RFC publication process, on the
development of standards and other RFCs in the IETF, and on how the IETF
makes decisions. This included work on technical decisions about the
content of the standards, on procedural and process decisions, and on
questions around how we can understand, model, and perhaps improve the
standards process. Some of the work considered what makes an RFC
successful, how RFCs are used and referenced, and what we can learn
about the importance of a topic by studying the RFCs, Internet-Drafts,
and email discussions.[¶](#section-2.4-1){.pilcrow}

There were three sets of questions to consider in this area. The first
question related to the success and failure of standards and
considered:[¶](#section-2.4-2){.pilcrow}

-   [What makes a successful and good
    RFC?[¶](#section-2.4-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.4-3.1}
-   [What makes the process of making RFCs
    successful?[¶](#section-2.4-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.4-3.2}
-   [How are RFCs used and referenced once
    published?[¶](#section-2.4-3.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.4-3.3}

Discussion considered how to better understand the path from an
Internet-Draft to an RFC, to see if there are specific factors that lead
to successful development of an Internet-Draft into an RFC. Participants
explored the extent to which this depends on the seniority and
experience of the authors, on the topic and IETF area, on the extent and
scope of mailing list discussion, and other factors, to understand
whether success of an Internet-Draft can be predicted and whether
interventions can be developed to increase the likelihood of success for
work.[¶](#section-2.4-4){.pilcrow}

The second question focused on decision
making.[¶](#section-2.4-5){.pilcrow}

-   [How does the IETF make design
    decisions?[¶](#section-2.4-6.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.4-6.1}
-   [What are the bottlenecks in effective decision
    making?[¶](#section-2.4-6.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.4-6.2}
-   [When is a decision made? And what is the
    decision?[¶](#section-2.4-6.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.4-6.3}

Difficulties here lie in capturing decisions and the results of
consensus calls early in the process, and understanding the factors that
lead to effective decision making.[¶](#section-2.4-7){.pilcrow}

Finally, there were questions regarding what can be learned about
protocols by studying IETF publications, processes, and decision making.
For example:[¶](#section-2.4-8){.pilcrow}

-   [Are there insights to be gained around how security concerns are
    discussed and considered in the development of
    standards?[¶](#section-2.4-9.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.4-9.1}
-   [Is it possible to verify correctness of protocols and detect
    ambiguities?[¶](#section-2.4-9.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.4-9.2}
-   [What can be learned by extracting insights from implementations and
    activities on implementation
    efforts?[¶](#section-2.4-9.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.4-9.3}

Answers to these questions will come from analysis of IETF emails, RFCs
and Internet-Drafts, meeting minutes, recordings, Github data, and
external data such as surveys, etc.[¶](#section-2.4-10){.pilcrow}

::: {#environmental-sustainability}
::: {#section-2.5 .section}
### [2.5.](#section-2.5){.section-number .selfRef} [Environmental Sustainability](#name-environmental-sustainabilit){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-environmental-sustainabilit}

The final discussion session considered environmental sustainability.
Topics included what the IETF\'s role with respect to climate change,
both in terms of what is the environmental impact of the way the IETF
develops standards and in terms of what is the environmental impact of
the standards the IETF develops.[¶](#section-2.5-1){.pilcrow}

Discussion started by considering how sustainable IETF meetings are,
focusing on the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions IETF meetings
are responsible for and how can we make the IETF more sustainable.
Analysis looked at the home locations of participants, meeting
locations, and carbon footprint of air travel and remote attendance to
estimate the CO2 costs of an IETF meeting. While the analysis is
ongoing, initial results suggest that the costs of holding multiple
in-person IETF meetings per year are likely unsustainable in terms of
CO2 emission.[¶](#section-2.5-2){.pilcrow}

The extent to which climate impacts are considered during the
development and standardization of Internet protocols was discussed.
RFCs and Internet-Drafts of active working groups were reviewed for
relevant keywords to highlight the extent to which climate change,
energy efficiency, and related topics were considered in the design of
Internet protocols. This review revealed the limited extent to which
these topics have been considered. There is ongoing work to get a fuller
picture by reviewing meeting minutes and mail archives as well, but
initial results show only limited consideration of these important
issues.[¶](#section-2.5-3){.pilcrow}

## [3.](#section-3){.section-number .selfRef} [Hackathon Report](#name-hackathon-report){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-hackathon-report}

The middle two days of the workshop were organized as a hackathon. The
aims of the hackathon were to 1) acquaint people with the different data
sources and analysis methods, 2) seek to answer some of the questions
that came up during presentations on the first day of the workshop, and
3) foster collaboration among researchers to grow a community of IETF
data researchers.[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

At the end of Day 1, the plenary presentation day, people were invited
to divide themselves into groups and select their own respective
facilitators. All groups had their own work space and could use their
own communication methods and channels. Furthermore, daily check-ins
were organized during the two hackathon days. On the final day, the
hackathon groups presented their work in a plenary
session.[¶](#section-3-2){.pilcrow}

According to the co-chairs, the objectives of the hackathon have been
met, and the output significantly exceeded expectations. It allowed more
interaction than academic conferences and produced some actual research
results by people who had not collaborated before the
workshop.[¶](#section-3-3){.pilcrow}

Future workshops that choose to integrate a hackathon could consider
asking participants to submit issues and questions beforehand
(potentially as part of the position papers or the sign-up process) to
facilitate the formation of groups.[¶](#section-3-4){.pilcrow}
