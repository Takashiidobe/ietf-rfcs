# RFC 9316 {#rfcnum}

# Intent Classification {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

Intent is an abstract, high-level policy used to operate a network. An
intent-based management system includes an interface for users to input
requests and an engine to translate the intents into the network
configuration and manage their life
cycle.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

This document mostly discusses the concept of network intents, but other
types of intents are also considered. Specifically, this document
highlights stakeholder perspectives of intent, methods to classify and
encode intent, and the associated intent taxonomy; it also defines
relevant intent terms where necessary, provides a foundation for
intent-related research, and facilitates solution
development.[¶](#section-abstract-2){.pilcrow}

The vision of intent-based networks has attracted a lot of attention
because it promises to simplify the management of networks by human
operators. This is done by simply specifying what should happen on the
network without giving any instructions on how to do it. This promise
caused many researcher-led activities and telecom companies to start
researching this new vision and many Standards Development Organizations
(SDOs) to propose different intent
frameworks.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

This document proposes an intent classification methodology and an
intent taxonomy. The scope of these proposals is to ensure a common
understanding in the research community in terms of what the intent
users, intent types, or intent solutions, etc., are for specific
scenarios that are being considered.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

The document represents the consensus of the Network Management Research
Group (NMRG). It has been reviewed extensively by the Research Group
(RG) members who are actively involved in the research and development
of the technology covered by this document. It is not an IETF product
and is not a standard.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

Intent-based networking is an active research topic spanning across
different areas that could benefit from an intent classification and
taxonomy.[¶](#section-1.1-1){.pilcrow}

Some examples include:[¶](#section-1.1-2){.pilcrow}

-   [intent expression and recognition (\[[Bezahaf21](#Bezahaf21){.cite
    .xref}\], \[[Bezahaf19](#Bezahaf19){.cite .xref}\],
    \[[Jacobs18](#Jacobs18){.cite .xref}\]). The use of a common
    classification could provide consistency in the understanding of the
    various forms of intent expressions being proposed and
    investigated.[¶](#section-1.1-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-1.1-3.1}
-   [the orchestration of cognitive autonomous radio access networks
    (RANs) \[[Banerjee21](#Banerjee21){.cite .xref}\] where intents are
    classified based on their
    content.[¶](#section-1.1-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-1.1-3.2}
-   [intent network verification \[[Tian19](#Tian19){.cite .xref}\],
    where the authors are working to propose new intent
    language.[¶](#section-1.1-3.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-1.1-3.3}

Furthermore, this document is already proving to be extremely relevant
to the research community as it has been used as the basis for proposing
self-generated Intent-based systems \[[Bezahaf19](#Bezahaf19){.cite
.xref}\], for advancing Virtual Network Function (VNF) placement
solutions based on Internet-Based Networks (IBNs) that rely on defining
user intent profiles corresponding to abstract network services
\[[Leivadeas21](#Leivadeas21){.cite .xref}\], for improving existing
solutions in provisioning intent-based networks, for proposing new
approaches to service management \[[Davoli21](#Davoli21){.cite .xref}\],
and even for defining grammars for users to specify the high-level
requirements for blockchain selection in the form of intent
\[[Padovan20](#Padovan20){.cite .xref}\]. As well, the document has been
mentioned in surveys addressing the topic of intelligent intent-based
autonomous networks \[[Mehmood21](#Mehmood21){.cite .xref}\]
\[[Szilagyi21](#Szilagyi21){.cite .xref}\].[¶](#section-1.1-4){.pilcrow}

This document also describes an example on how this proposal has been
successfully applied in an academic environment
\[[POC-IBN](#POC-IBN){.cite .xref}\] by researchers in the area of
Software-Defined Networking / Network Function Virtualization (SDN/NFV)
for defining the scope of their project. The specific problem addressed
by researchers is how to apply intent concepts at different levels that
correspond to different stakeholders.[¶](#section-1.1-5){.pilcrow}

The IEEE Communications Society Technical Committee on Network Operation
and Management (IEEE-CNOM), IRTF Network Management Research Group, and
IFIP WG6.6 have developed a taxonomy for network and service management
\[[IFIP-NSM](#IFIP-NSM){.cite .xref}\] that is used by the research
community in network management and operations to structure the research
area through a well-defined set of keywords and to improve quality of
reviews in submissions to journals, conferences, and workshops. The
proposed intent taxonomy may be contributed as an extension to this
taxonomy for intent-driven management.[¶](#section-1.1-6){.pilcrow}

### [1.2.](#section-1.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Standards and Open-Source Activities](#name-standards-and-open-source-a){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-standards-and-open-source-a}

Several SDOs and open-source projects, such as the IRTF NMRG, Open
Networking Foundation (ONF) \[[ONF](#ONF){.cite .xref}\] / Open Network
Operating System (ONOS) \[[ONOS](#ONOS){.cite .xref}\], European
Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) / Experiential Networked
Intelligence (ENI), and TMF with its autonomous networks, have proposed
intents for defining a set of network operations to execute in a
declarative manner.[¶](#section-1.2-1){.pilcrow}

More recently, the IRTF NMRG is working on \"Intent-Based Networking -
Concepts and Definitions\" \[[RFC9315](#RFC9315){.cite .xref}\]. This
document clarifies the concept of \"Intent\" and provides an overview of
the functionality that is associated with it. The goal is to contribute
towards a common and shared understanding of terms, concepts, and
functionality that can be used as the foundation to guide further
definition of associated research and engineering problems and their
solutions.[¶](#section-1.2-2){.pilcrow}

The present document, together with \[[RFC9315](#RFC9315){.cite
.xref}\], aims to become the foundation for future intent-related topic
discussions regarding the NMRG.[¶](#section-1.2-3){.pilcrow}

The SDOs usually come up with their own way of specifying an intent and
their own understanding of what an intent is. Additionally, each SDO
defines a set of terms and level of abstraction, its intent users, and
the applications and usage scenarios.[¶](#section-1.2-4){.pilcrow}

However, most intent approaches proposed by SDOs share the same
features:[¶](#section-1.2-5){.pilcrow}

-   [It must be declarative in nature, meaning that an intent user
    specifies the goal on the network without specifying how to achieve
    that goal.[¶](#section-1.2-6.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-1.2-6.1}
-   [It must be vendor agnostic in the sense that it abstracts the
    network capabilities or the network infrastructure from the intent
    user, and it can be ported across different
    platforms.[¶](#section-1.2-6.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-1.2-6.2}
-   [It must provide an easy-to-use interface, which simplifies the
    interaction of the intent users with the intent system through the
    usage of familiar terminology or
    concepts.[¶](#section-1.2-6.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-1.2-6.3}
-   [It should be able to detect and resolve intent conflicts, which
    include, for example, static (compile-time) conflicts and dynamic
    (run-time)
    conflicts.[¶](#section-1.2-6.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-1.2-6.4}

### [1.3.](#section-1.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Scope](#name-scope){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-scope}

The focus of this document is on the definition of criteria enabling the
categorization of intents from viewpoint of the stakeholders. Concepts
and definitions related to IBN are provided in
\[[RFC9315](#RFC9315){.cite .xref}\].[¶](#section-1.3-1){.pilcrow}

This document mostly addresses intents in the context of network
intents; however, other types of intents are not excluded, as presented
in Sections [4.4](#sect-4.4){.auto .internal .xref} and
[6.2](#sect-6.2){.auto .internal .xref}.[¶](#section-1.3-2){.pilcrow}

It is impossible to fully differentiate intents only by the common
characteristics followed by concepts, terms, and intentions. This
document clarifies what an intent represents for different stakeholders
through a classification on various dimensions, such as solutions,
intent users, and intent types. This classification ensures common
understanding among all participants and is used to determine the scope
and priority of individual projects, proof of concepts (PoCs), research
initiatives, or open-source projects.[¶](#section-1.3-3){.pilcrow}

The scope of intent classification in this document includes solutions,
intent users, and intent types; the initial classification table is made
according to this scope. The methodology presented can be used to update
the classification tables by adding or removing different solutions,
intent users, or intent types to cater to future scenarios,
applications, or domains.[¶](#section-1.3-4){.pilcrow}

### [4.1.](#section-4.1){.section-number .selfRef} [What is intent?](#name-what-is-intent){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-what-is-intent}

The term \"Intent\" has become very widely used in the industry for
different purposes; sometimes its use is not even in agreement with
SDO-shared principles mentioned in [Section 1](#sect-1){.auto .internal
.xref}. \[[RFC9315](#RFC9315){.cite .xref}\] brings clarification with
relation to what an intent is and how it differentiates from policies
and services.[¶](#section-4.1-1){.pilcrow}

Different stakeholders have different perspectives of the network;
therefore, they have different intent requirements. Their intent is
sometimes technical, non-technical, abstract, or technology specific.
Therefore, it is important to start a discussion in the industry and
academic communities about what intent is for different solutions and
intent users. It is also imperative to try to propose some intent
categories/classifications that could be understood by a wider audience.
This would help us define intent interfaces, domain-specific languages,
and models.[¶](#section-4.1-2){.pilcrow}

### [4.2.](#section-4.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Intent Solutions and Intent Users](#name-intent-solutions-and-intent){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-intent-solutions-and-intent}

Intent types are defined by all aspects that are required to profile
different requirements to easily distinguish between them. However, in
order to facilitate a clustered classification, we can focus on two
aspects: the solution and intent user. They can be considered to be the
main keys to classify intents, as we can easily group requirements by
solution and intent user.[¶](#section-4.2-1){.pilcrow}

On the one hand, different solutions and intent users have different
requirements, expectations, and priorities for intent-based networking.
Therefore, intent users require different intent types, depending on
their context, since they participate in different use cases. For
instance, some intent users are more technical and require intents that
expose more technical information. Other intent users do not have
knowledge of the network infrastructure and require intents that shield
them from different networking concepts and
technologies.[¶](#section-4.2-2){.pilcrow}

The following are the solutions and intent users that intent-based
networking needs to support:[¶](#section-4.2-3){.pilcrow}

These intent solutions and intent users represent a starting point for
the classification and are expendable through the methodology presented
in [Section 6.1](#sect-6.1){.auto .internal

-   [For DC network scenarios, administrators have their own clear
    network intent such as load balancing. For all traffic flows that

Current network APIs and CLIs are too complex because they are highly
integrated with the low-level concepts exposed by networks. Customers,
application developers, and end users must not be required to set IP
addresses, VLANs, subnets, or ports, whereas operators may still want to
have both more technical and network visibility. All stakeholders would
benefit from simpler interfaces, such as:[¶](#section-4.3-1){.pilcrow}

Intent can be used to operate immediately on a target (much like issuing
a command) or whenever it is appropriate (e.g., in response to an
event). In either case, intent has a number of behaviors that serve to
further organize its purpose, as described by the following
subsections.[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

The modeling of intents can be abstracted using the following
three-tuple:[¶](#section-5.1-1){.pilcrow}

{Context, Capabilities, Constraints}[¶](#section-5.1-2){.pilcrow}

-   [Context grounds the intent and determines if it is relevant or not
    for the current situation. Thus, context selects intents based on
    applicability.[¶](#section-5.1-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.1-3.1}
-   [Capabilities describe the functionality that the intent can
    perform. Capabilities take different forms depending on the
    expressivity of the intent as well as the programming paradigm(s)
    used.[¶](#section-5.1-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.1-3.2}
-   [Constraints define any restrictions on the capabilities to be used
    for that particular
    context.[¶](#section-5.1-3.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.1-3.3}

Metadata can be attached via strategy templates to each of the elements
of the three-tuple and may be used to describe how the intent should be
used and how it operates as well as prescribe any operational
dependencies that must be taken into
account.[¶](#section-5.1-4){.pilcrow}

model, each category will have its own specific context, capabilities,

Expanding on the introduction in [Section 4.2](#sect-4.2){.auto
.internal .xref}, intent user types represent the intent users that
define and issue the intent request. Depending on the intent solutions,
there are specific intent users. Examples of intent users are customers,
network operators, service operators, enterprise administrators, cloud
administrators, underlay network administrators, or application
developers.[¶](#section-5.2-1){.pilcrow}

-   [Customers and end users do not necessarily know the functional and
    operational details of the network that they are using. Furthermore,
    they lack skills to understand such details; in fact, such knowledge
    is typically not relevant to their job. In addition, the network may
    not expose these details to its intent users. This class of intent
    users focuses on the applications that they run and uses services
    offered by the network. Hence, they want to specify policies that
    provide consistent behavior according to their business needs. They
    do not have to worry about how the intents are deployed onto the
    underlying network and especially whether the intents need to be
    translated to different forms to enable network elements to
    understand them.[¶](#section-5.2-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.2-2.1}
-   [Application developers work in a set of abstractions defined by
    their application and programming environment(s). For example, many
    application developers think in terms of objects (e.g., a VPN).
    While this makes sense to the application developer, most network
    devices do not have a VPN object per se; rather, the VPN is formed
    through a set of configuration statements for that device in concert
    with configuration statements for the other devices that together
    make up the VPN. Hence, the view of application developers matches
    the services provided by the network but may not directly correspond
    to other views of other intent
    users.[¶](#section-5.2-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.2-2.2}

Intents are used to manage the behavior of the networks they are applied
to and all intents are applied within a specific scope, such
as:[¶](#section-5.3-1){.pilcrow}

-   [connectivity scope, if the intent creates or modifies a
    connection[¶](#section-5.3-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.3-2.1}

    characteristics of the network, customers, or end
    users[¶](#section-5.3-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.3-2.2}

Intent can be classified by whether it is necessary to feed back
technical network information or non-technical information to the intent
user after the intent is executed. As well, intent abstraction covers
the level of technical details in the intent
itself.[¶](#section-5.5-1){.pilcrow}

-   [Non-technical intent users do not care how the intent is executed
    nor do they care about the details of the network. As a result, they
    do not need to know the configuration information of the underlying
    network. They only focus on whether the intent execution result
    achieves the goal and the execution effect such as the quality of
    completion and the length of execution. In this scenario, we refer
    to an abstraction without technical
    feedback.[¶](#section-5.5-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.5-2.1}
-   [Administrators, such as network administrators, perform intents,
    such as allocating network resources, selecting transmission paths,
    handling network failures, etc. They require multiple feedback
    indicators for network resource conditions, congestion conditions,
    fault conditions, etc., after execution. In this case, we refer to
    an abstraction with technical
    feedback.[¶](#section-5.5-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.5-2.2}

As per the definition of \"intent\" provided in
\[[RFC9315](#RFC9315){.cite .xref}\], lower-level intents are not

## [6.](#section-6){.section-number .selfRef} [Intent Classification](#name-intent-classification){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-intent-classification}

This section proposes an approach to intent classification that may help
to classify mainstream intent-related
demos/tools.[¶](#section-6-1){.pilcrow}

The three classifications in this document have been proposed from
scratch (following the methodology presented) through three iterations:
one for a carrier network intent solution, one for a DC intent solution,
and one for an enterprise intent solution. For each intent solution, we
identified the specific intent users and intent types. Then, we further
identified intent scope, network scope, abstractions, and life-cycle
requirements.[¶](#section-6-2){.pilcrow}

These classifications and the generated tables can be easily extended.
For example, for the DC intent solution, a new category \"resource
scope\" is identified, and the classification table has been extended
accordingly.[¶](#section-6-3){.pilcrow}

In the future, as new scenarios, applications, and domains emerge, new
classifications and taxonomies can be identified, following the proposed
methodology.[¶](#section-6-4){.pilcrow}

The intent classifications have been documented to the best of our
knowledge at the time of writing. Additional classifications will most
likely come to light in the future.[¶](#section-6-5){.pilcrow}

The output of the intent classification is the intent taxonomy
introduced in the subsections of this
section.[¶](#section-6-6){.pilcrow}

Thus, the subsections of [Section 6](#sect-6){.auto .internal .xref}
introduce the proposed intent classification methodology, the
consolidated intent taxonomy for three intent solutions, and the
concrete examples of intent classifications for three different intent
solutions (e.g., carrier network, data center, and enterprise) that were
derived using the proposed methodology and can be filled in for PoCs,
demos, research projects, or future
documents.[¶](#section-6-7){.pilcrow}

### [6.1.](#section-6.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Intent Classification Methodology](#name-intent-classification-metho){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-intent-classification-metho}

This section describes the methodology used to derive the initial
classification proposed in the document. The proposed methodology can be
used to create new intent classifications from scratch by analyzing the
solution knowledge. As well, the methodology can be used to update
existing classification tables by adding or removing different
solutions, intent users, or intent types in order to cater to future
scenarios, applications, or domains.[¶](#section-6.1-1){.pilcrow}

Methodology](#name-intent-classification-method){.selfRef}
:::

The intent classification workflow starts from the solution knowledge,
which can provide information on requirements, use cases, technologies
used, network properties, intent users that define and issue the intent
request, and requirements. The following defines the steps to classify
an intent:[¶](#section-6.1-3){.pilcrow}

1.  [Receive the information provided in the solution knowledge as input
    for identifying the intent solution (e.g., carrier, enterprise, and
    data center). Intent solutions are reviewed against the existing
    classification and can either be used if present or added if not
    there; if not needed, they can be removed from the classification
    (R1-U1).[¶](#section-6.1-4.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.1-4.1}
2.  [Identify the intent user types (e.g., customer, network operators,
    service operators, etc.). Review the existing intent classification.
    Then use the intent user type if present; add it if it is not there
    or remove it if not needed
    (R2-U2).[¶](#section-6.1-4.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.1-4.2}
3.  [Identify the types of intent (e.g., network intent, customer
    service intent). Review the existing classification and then use,
    add, or remove the intent type
    (R3-U3).[¶](#section-6.1-4.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.1-4.3}
4.  [Identify the intent scopes (e.g., connectivity, application) based
    on the solution knowledge. Then, review the existing classification.
    Use, add, or remove the identified intent scope
    (R4-U4).[¶](#section-6.1-4.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.1-4.4}
5.  [Identify the network scopes (e.g., campus, radio access). Then,
    review the existing classification. Either use, add, or remove the
    identified network scope
    (R5-U5).[¶](#section-6.1-4.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.1-4.5}
6.  [Identify the abstractions (e.g., technical, non-technical). Then,
    review the existing classification and either use, add, or remove
    the abstractions
    (R6-U6).[¶](#section-6.1-4.6){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.1-4.6}
7.  [Identify the life-cycle requirements (e.g., persistent, transient).
    Then, review the existing classification. Either use, add, or remove
    the life-cycle requirements
    (R7-U7).[¶](#section-6.1-4.7){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.1-4.7}
8.  [Identify any new categories. Use and add the newly identified
    categories. New categories can be identified as new domains or
    applications emerge or as new areas of concern (e.g., privacy,
    compliance) arise that are not listed in the current
    methodology.[¶](#section-6.1-4.8){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.1-4.8}

#### [6.3.3.](#section-6.3.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Intent Classification Example](#name-intent-classification-examp){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-intent-classification-examp}

This section contains an example of how the methodology described in
[Section 6.1](#sect-6.1){.auto .internal .xref} can be used in order to
classify intents introduced in the \"A Multi-Level Approach to IBN\" PoC
demonstration \[[POC-IBN](#POC-IBN){.cite .xref}\]. This PoC is led by
academics carrying out research in the area of SDN/NFV, and the specific
problem they are addressing is the application of the intent concept at
different levels that correspond to different stakeholders. For this
research work, they considered two types of intents: slice intents and
service chain intents.[¶](#section-6.3.3-1){.pilcrow}

In this PoC \[[POC-IBN](#POC-IBN){.cite .xref}\], a slice intent
expresses a request for a network slice with two types of components: a
set of top-layer virtual functions and a set of virtual switches and/or
routers of L2/L3 VNFs. A service chain intent expresses a request for a
service operated through a chain of service components running in L4-L7
virtual functions.[¶](#section-6.3.3-2){.pilcrow}

Following the intent classification methodology described step by step
in [Section 6.1](#sect-6.1){.auto .internal .xref}, the following can be
derived:[¶](#section-6.3.3-3){.pilcrow}

1.  [The intent solution for both intents is carrier
    network.[¶](#section-6.3.3-4.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.3.3-4.1}
2.  [The intent user type is network operator for the slice intent and
    service operator for the service chain
    intent.[¶](#section-6.3.3-4.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.3.3-4.2}
3.  [The type of intent is a network service intent for the slice intent
    and a customer service intent for the service chain
    intent.[¶](#section-6.3.3-4.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.3.3-4.3}
4.  [The intent scopes are connectivity and
    application.[¶](#section-6.3.3-4.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.3.3-4.4}
5.  [The network scope is VNF, cloud edge, and cloud
    core.[¶](#section-6.3.3-4.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.3.3-4.5}
6.  [The abstractions are with technical feedback for the slice intent
    and without technical feedback for the service chain
    intent.[¶](#section-6.3.3-4.6){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.3.3-4.6}
7.  [The life cycle is
    persistent.[¶](#section-6.3.3-4.7){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.3.3-4.7}

The following table shows how to represent this information in a tabular
form. The \"X\" in the table refers to the slice intent; the \"Y\" in
the table refers to the service chain
intent.[¶](#section-6.3.3-5){.pilcrow}

This section depicts an example on how the methodology described in
[Section 6.1](#sect-6.1){.auto .internal .xref} can be used by the
research community to classify intents. As mentioned in [Section
6.3.3](#sect-6.3.3){.auto .internal .xref}, a successful use of the
classification proposed in this document is introduced in the PoC
demonstration titled \"A Multi-Level Approach to IBN\"
\[[POC-IBN](#POC-IBN){.cite .xref}\]. The PoC is led by academics
carrying out research in the area of SDN/NFV; the specific problem they
are addressing is the application of the intent concept at different
levels that correspond to different
stakeholders.[¶](#section-6.4.3-1){.pilcrow}

For their research work, they considered two types of intents: slice
intents and service chain intents. For the data center solution, only
the slice intent is relevant.[¶](#section-6.4.3-2){.pilcrow}

As already mentioned in [Section 6.3.3](#sect-6.3.3){.auto .internal
.xref}, a slice intent expresses a request for a network slice with two
types of components: a set of top-layer virtual functions and a set of
virtual switches and/or routers of L2/L3
VNFs.[¶](#section-6.4.3-3){.pilcrow}

Following the intent classification methodology described step by step
in [Section 6.1](#sect-6.1){.auto .internal .xref}, we identify the
following:[¶](#section-6.4.3-4){.pilcrow}

1.  [The intent solution is data
    center.[¶](#section-6.4.3-5.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.4.3-5.1}
2.  [The intent user type is the cloud administrator for the slice
    intent and service chain
    intent.[¶](#section-6.4.3-5.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.4.3-5.2}
3.  [The type of intent is a cloud management intent for the slice
    intent.[¶](#section-6.4.3-5.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.4.3-5.3}
4.  [The intent scopes are connectivity and
    application.[¶](#section-6.4.3-5.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.4.3-5.4}
5.  [The network scope is logical; the resource scope is
    virtual.[¶](#section-6.4.3-5.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.4.3-5.5}
6.  [The abstractions are with technical feedback for the slice
    intent.[¶](#section-6.4.3-5.6){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.4.3-5.6}
7.  [The life cycle is
    persistent.[¶](#section-6.4.3-5.7){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.4.3-5.7}

The following table shows how to represent this information in a tabular
form; the \"X\" in the table refers to the slice
intent.[¶](#section-6.4.3-6){.pilcrow}

This document is aligned with the RG objectives and supports
investigations into intent-based networking by proposing an intent
categorization methodology and taxonomy. It brings clarification to what
an intent represents for different stakeholders through the proposal of
an intent classification approach, ensuring that a common understanding
among all the participants exists. This, together with the proposed
intent taxonomy provides a solid foundation for future intent-related
discussions within the NMRG.[¶](#section-7-1){.pilcrow}

The benefits of this intent classification document in the research
community have been demonstrated through a PoC implementation
\[[POC-IBN](#POC-IBN){.cite .xref}\] in which the document\'s concepts
have been applied at different levels corresponding to different
stakeholders.[¶](#section-7-2){.pilcrow}

## [8.](#section-8){.section-number .selfRef} [Security Considerations](#name-security-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-security-considerations}

This document identifies security and privacy as categories of the
intent scope. The intents could be solely security intents and privacy
intents, or security can be embedded in the intents that include also
connectivity, application, and QoS scope.[¶](#section-8-1){.pilcrow}

Security and privacy scope is when the intent specifies the security
characteristics of the network, customers, or end users, and privacy for
customers and end users.[¶](#section-8-2){.pilcrow}

More details of these security intents will be described in future
documents that specify architecture, functionality, user intents, and
models. An analysis of the security considerations of the overall
intent-based system is provided in [Section
9](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9315#section-9){.relref} of
