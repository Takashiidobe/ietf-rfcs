# HTTP Random Access and Live Content {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

To accommodate byte-range requests for content that has data appended
over time, this document defines semantics that allow an HTTP client and
a server to perform byte-range GET and HEAD requests that start at an
arbitrary byte offset within the representation and end at an
indeterminate offset.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

Some Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) clients use byte-range requests
(range requests using the \"bytes\" range unit) to transfer select
portions of large representations \[[RFC7233](#RFC7233){.xref}\]. In
some cases, large representations require content to be continuously or
periodically appended, such as representations consisting of live audio
or video sources, blockchain databases, and log files. Clients cannot
access the appended/live content using a range request with the
\"bytes\" range unit using the currently defined byte-range semantics
without accepting performance or behavior sacrifices that are not
acceptable for many applications.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

For instance, HTTP clients have the ability to access appended content
on an indeterminate-length resource by transferring the entire
representation from the beginning and continuing to read the appended
content as it\'s made available. Obviously, this is highly inefficient
for cases where the representation is large and only the most recently
appended content is needed by the client.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

Alternatively, clients can access appended content by sending periodic,
open-ended byte-range requests using the last known end byte position as
the range start. Performing low-frequency periodic byte-range requests
in this fashion (polling) introduces latency since the client will
necessarily be somewhat behind in transferring the aggregated content,
effectively resulting in the same kind of latency issues with the
segmented content transfer mechanisms in \"HTTP Live Streaming\" (HLS)
\[[RFC8216](#RFC8216){.xref}\] and \"Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over
HTTP\" \[[MPEG-DASH](#MPEG-DASH){.xref}\]. While performing these range
requests at higher frequency can reduce this latency, it also incurs
more processing overhead and HTTP exchanges as many of the requests will
return no content, since content is usually aggregated in groups of
bytes (e.g., a video frame, audio sample, block, or log
entry).[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

This document describes a usage model for range requests that enables
efficient retrieval of representations that are appended to over time by
using large values and associated semantics for communicating range end
positions. This model allows representations to be progressively
delivered by servers as new content is added. It also ensures
compatibility with servers and intermediaries that don\'t support this
technique.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

This document cites Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) productions from
\[[RFC7233](#RFC7233){.xref}\], using the notation defined in
\[[RFC5234](#RFC5234){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1.1-1){.pilcrow}

## [2.](#section-2){.section-number .selfRef} [Performing Range Requests on Random-Access Aggregating (Live) Content](#name-performing-range-requests-o){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-performing-range-requests-o}

This document recommends a two-step process for accessing resources that
have indeterminate-length representations.[¶](#section-2-1){.pilcrow}

Two steps are necessary because of limitations with the range request
header fields and the Content-Range response header fields. A server
cannot know from a range request that a client wishes to receive a
response that does not have a definite end. More critically, the header
fields do not allow the server to signal that a resource has
indeterminate length without also providing a fixed portion of the
resource.[¶](#section-2-2){.pilcrow}

A client first learns that the resource has a representation of
indeterminate length by requesting a range of the resource. The server
responds with the range that is available but indicates that the length
of the representation is unknown using the existing Content-Range
syntax. See [Section 2.1](#establishing-range){.xref} for details and
examples.[¶](#section-2-3){.pilcrow}

Once the client knows the resource has indeterminate length, it can
request a range with a very large end position from the resource. The
client chooses an explicit end value larger than can be transferred in
the foreseeable term. A server that supports range requests of
indeterminate length signals its understanding of the client\'s
indeterminate range request by indicating that the range it is providing
has a range end that exactly matches the client\'s requested range end
rather than a range that is bounded by what is currently available. See
[Section 2.2](#live-range-requests){.xref} for
details.[¶](#section-2-4){.pilcrow}

### [2.1.](#section-2.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Establishing the Randomly Accessible Byte Range](#name-establishing-the-randomly-a){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-establishing-the-randomly-a}

Determining if a representation is continuously aggregating (\"live\")
and determining the randomly accessible byte range can both be performed
using the existing definition for an open-ended byte-range request.
Specifically, [Section
2.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7233#section-2.1){.relref} of
\[[RFC7233](#RFC7233){.xref}\] defines a byte-range request of the
form:[¶](#section-2.1-1){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-2.1-2}
``` {.sourcecode .lang-abnf}
   byte-range-spec = first-byte-pos "-" [ last-byte-pos ]
```

[¶](#section-2.1-2){.pilcrow}
:::

which allows a client to send a HEAD request with a first-byte-pos and
leave last-byte-pos absent. A server that receives a satisfiable
byte-range request (with first-byte-pos smaller than the current
representation length) may respond with a 206 status code (Partial
Content) with a Content-Range header field indicating the currently
satisfiable byte range. For example:[¶](#section-2.1-3){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-2.1-4 .artwork .art-text .alignLeft .art-message/http; .msgtype=\"request\"}
    HEAD /resource HTTP/1.1
    Host: example.com
    Range: bytes=0-

[¶](#section-2.1-4){.pilcrow}
:::

returns a response of the form:[¶](#section-2.1-5){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-2.1-6 .artwork .art-text .alignLeft .art-message/http; .msgtype=\"response\"}
    HTTP/1.1 206 Partial Content
    Content-Range: bytes 0-1234567/*

[¶](#section-2.1-6){.pilcrow}
:::

from the server indicating that (1) the complete representation length
is unknown (via the \"\*\" in place of the complete-length field) and
(2) only bytes 0-1234567 were accessible at the time the request was
processed by the server. The client can infer from this response that
bytes 0-1234567 of the representation can be requested and transfer can
be performed immediately.[¶](#section-2.1-7){.pilcrow}
:::
:::

::: {#live-range-requests}
::: {#section-2.2 .section}
### [2.2.](#section-2.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Byte-Range Requests beyond the Randomly Accessible Byte Range](#name-byte-range-requests-beyond-){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-byte-range-requests-beyond-}

Once a client has determined that a representation has an indeterminate
length and established the byte range that can be accessed, it may want
to perform a request with a start position within the randomly
accessible content range and an end position at an indefinite/live point
\-- a point where the byte-range GET request is fulfilled on-demand as
the content is aggregated.[¶](#section-2.2-1){.pilcrow}

For example, for a large video asset, a client may wish to start a
content transfer from the video \"key\" frame immediately before the
point of aggregation and continue the content transfer indefinitely as
content is aggregated, in order to support low-latency startup of a live
video stream.[¶](#section-2.2-2){.pilcrow}

Unlike a byte-range request header field, a byte-content-range response
header field cannot be \"open-ended\", per [Section
4.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7233#section-4.2){.relref} of
\[[RFC7233](#RFC7233){.xref}\]:[¶](#section-2.2-3){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-2.2-4}
``` {.sourcecode .lang-abnf}
   byte-content-range  = bytes-unit SP
                        ( byte-range-resp / unsatisfied-range )

   byte-range-resp     = byte-range "/" ( complete-length / "*" )
   byte-range          = first-byte-pos "-" last-byte-pos
   unsatisfied-range   = "*/" complete-length

   complete-length     = 1*DIGIT
```

[¶](#section-2.2-4){.pilcrow}
:::

Specifically, last-byte-pos is required in byte-range. So, in order to
preserve interoperability with existing HTTP clients, servers, proxies,
and caches, this document proposes a mechanism for a client to indicate
support for handling an indeterminate-length byte-range response and a
mechanism for a server to indicate if/when it\'s providing an
indeterminate-length response.[¶](#section-2.2-5){.pilcrow}

A client can indicate support for handling indeterminate-length
byte-range responses by providing a very large value for the
last-byte-pos in the byte-range request. For example, a client can
perform a byte-range GET request of the
form:[¶](#section-2.2-6){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-2.2-7 .artwork .art-text .alignLeft .art-message/http; .msgtype=\"request\"}
    GET /resource HTTP/1.1
    Host: example.com
    Range: bytes=1230000-999999999999

[¶](#section-2.2-7){.pilcrow}
:::

where the last-byte-pos in the request is much larger than the
last-byte-pos returned in response to an open-ended byte-range HEAD
request, as described above, and much larger than the expected maximum
size of the representation. See [Section 6](#Security){.xref} for range
value considerations.[¶](#section-2.2-8){.pilcrow}

In response, a server may indicate that it is supplying a continuously
aggregating/live response by supplying the client request\'s
last-byte-pos in the Content-Range response header
field.[¶](#section-2.2-9){.pilcrow}

For example:[¶](#section-2.2-10){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-2.2-11 .artwork .art-text .alignLeft .art-message/http; .msgtype=\"request\"}
    GET /resource HTTP/1.1
    Host: example.com
    Range: bytes=1230000-999999999999

[¶](#section-2.2-11){.pilcrow}
:::

returns[¶](#section-2.2-12){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-2.2-13 .artwork .art-text .alignLeft .art-message/http; .msgtype=\"response\"}
    HTTP/1.1 206 Partial Content
    Content-Range: bytes 1230000-999999999999/*

[¶](#section-2.2-13){.pilcrow}
:::

from the server to indicate that the response will start at byte 1230000
and continue indefinitely to include all aggregated content, as it
becomes available.[¶](#section-2.2-14){.pilcrow}

A server that doesn\'t support or supply a continuously aggregating/live
response will supply the currently satisfiable byte range, as it would
with an open-ended byte request.[¶](#section-2.2-15){.pilcrow}

For example:[¶](#section-2.2-16){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-2.2-17 .artwork .art-text .alignLeft .art-message/http; .msgtype=\"request\"}
    GET /resource HTTP/1.1
    Host: example.com
    Range: bytes=1230000-999999999999

[¶](#section-2.2-17){.pilcrow}
:::

returns[¶](#section-2.2-18){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-2.2-19 .artwork .art-text .alignLeft .art-message/http; .msgtype=\"response\"}
    HTTP/1.1 206 Partial Content
    Content-Range: bytes 1230000-1234567/*

[¶](#section-2.2-19){.pilcrow}
:::

from the server to indicate that the response will start at byte
1230000, end at byte 1234567, and not include any aggregated content.
This is the response expected from a typical HTTP server \-- one that
doesn\'t support byte-range requests on aggregating
content.[¶](#section-2.2-20){.pilcrow}

A client that doesn\'t receive a response indicating it is continuously
aggregating must use other means to access aggregated content (e.g.,
periodic byte-range polling).[¶](#section-2.2-21){.pilcrow}

A server that does return a continuously aggregating/live response
should return data using chunked transfer coding and not provide a
Content-Length header field. A 0-length chunk indicates the end of the
transfer, per [Section
4.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7230#section-4.1){.relref} of
\[[RFC7230](#RFC7230){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2.2-22){.pilcrow}

A client that wishes to only receive newly aggregated portions of a
resource (i.e., start at the live point) can use a HEAD request to learn
what range the server has currently available and initiate an
indeterminate-length transfer. For example:[¶](#section-3.1-1){.pilcrow}

    206 Partial Content
    Content-Range: bytes 0-1234567/*

[¶](#section-3.1-4){.pilcrow}
:::

The client can then issue a request for a range starting at the end
value (using a very large value for the end of a range) and receive only
new content.[¶](#section-3.1-5){.pilcrow}

For example:[¶](#section-3.1-6){.pilcrow}

Some representations lend themselves to front-end content removal in
addition to aggregation. While still supporting random access,
representations of this type have a portion at the beginning (the \"0\"
end) of the randomly accessible region that becomes inaccessible over
time. Examples of this kind of representation would be an audio-video
time-shift buffer or a rolling log file.[¶](#section-3.2-1){.pilcrow}

A server that doesn\'t support or supply a continuously aggregating/live
response will supply the currently satisfiable byte range, as it would
with an open-ended byte request. For
example:[¶](#section-3.2-16){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-3.2-17 .artwork .art-text .alignLeft .art-message/http; .msgtype=\"request\"}
    GET /resource HTTP/1.1
    Host: example.com
    Range: bytes=0-999999999999

[¶](#section-3.2-17){.pilcrow}
:::

returns[¶](#section-3.2-18){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-3.2-19 .artwork .art-text .alignLeft .art-message/http; .msgtype=\"response\"}
    HTTP/1.1 206 Partial Content
    Content-Range: bytes 1020000-1254567/*

[¶](#section-3.2-19){.pilcrow}
:::

from the server to indicate that the response will start at byte
1020000, end at byte 1254567, and not include any aggregated content.
This is the response expected from a typical HTTP server \-- one that
doesn\'t support byte-range requests on aggregating
content.[¶](#section-3.2-20){.pilcrow}

Note that responses to GET requests performed on shift-buffer
representations using Range headers can be cached by intermediaries,
since the Content-Range response header indicates which portion of the
representation is being returned in the response body. However, GET
requests without a Range header cannot be cached since the first byte of
the response body can vary from request to request. To ensure GET
requests without Range headers on shift-buffer representations are not
cached, servers hosting a shift-buffer representation should either not
return a 200-level response (e.g., send a 300-level redirect response
with a URI that represents the current start of the shift buffer) or
indicate the response is non-cacheable. See
\[[RFC7234](#RFC7234){.xref}\] for details on HTTP cache
control.[¶](#section-3.2-21){.pilcrow}

## [4.](#section-4){.section-number .selfRef} [Recommendations for Byte-Range Request last-byte-pos Values](#name-recommendations-for-byte-ra){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-recommendations-for-byte-ra}

While it would be ideal to define a single large last-byte-pos value for
byte-range requests, there\'s no single value that would work for all
applications and platforms. For example, JavaScript numbers cannot
represent all integer values above 2\^\^53, so a JavaScript application
may want to use 2\^\^53-1 for last-byte-pos. This value, however, would
not be sufficient for all applications, such as long-duration
high-bitrate streams. So 2\^\^53-1 (9007199254740991) is recommended as
a last-byte-pos unless an application has a good justification to use a
smaller or larger value. For example, if it is always known that the
resource won\'t exceed a value smaller than the recommended
last-byte-pos for an application, a smaller value can be used. If it\'s
likely that an application will utilize resources larger than the
recommended last-byte-pos (such as a continuously aggregating
high-bitrate media stream), a larger value should be
used.[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

Note that, in accordance with the semantics defined above, servers that
support random-access live content will need to return the last-byte-pos
provided in the byte-range request in some cases \-- even if the
last-byte-pos cannot be represented as a numerical value internally by
the server. As is the case with any continuously aggregating/live
resource, the server should terminate the content transfer when the end
of the resource is reached \-- whether the end is due to termination of
the content source or the content length exceeds the server\'s maximum
representation length.[¶](#section-4-2){.pilcrow}

## [6.](#section-6){.section-number .selfRef} [Security Considerations](#name-security-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-security-considerations}

As described above, servers need to be prepared to receive last-byte-pos
values in range requests that are numerically larger than the server
implementation supports and return these values in Content-Range
response header fields. Servers should check the last-byte-pos value
before converting and storing them into numeric form to ensure the value
doesn\'t cause an overflow or index incorrect data. The simplest way to
satisfy the live-range semantics defined in this document without
potential overflow issues is to store the last-byte-pos as a string
value and return it in the byte-range Content-Range response header\'s
last-byte-pos field.[¶](#section-6-1){.pilcrow}
