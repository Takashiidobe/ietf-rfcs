# Intent-Based Networking - Concepts and Definitions {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

Intent and Intent-Based Networking are taking the industry by storm. At
the same time, terms related to Intent-Based Networking are often used
loosely and inconsistently, in many cases overlapping and confused with
other concepts such as \"policy.\" This document clarifies the concept
of \"intent\" and provides an overview of the functionality that is
associated with it. The goal is to contribute towards a common and
shared understanding of terms, concepts, and functionality that can be
used as the foundation to guide further definition of associated
research and engineering problems and their
solutions.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

This document is a product of the IRTF Network Management Research Group
(NMRG). It reflects the consensus of the RG, receiving reviews and
explicit support from many participants. It is published for
informational purposes.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

In the past, interest regarding management and operations in the IETF
has focused on individual network and device features. Standardization
emphasis has generally been put on management instrumentation that
needed to be provided to a networking device. A prime example of this is
SNMP-based management \[[RFC3411](#RFC3411){.cite .xref}\] and the 200+
MIBs that have been defined by the IETF over the years. More recent
examples include YANG data model definitions \[[RFC7950](#RFC7950){.cite
.xref}\] for aspects such as interface configuration, Access Control
List (ACL) configuration, and Syslog
configuration.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

There is a clear sense and reality that managing networks by configuring
myriads of \"nerd knobs\" on a device-by-device basis is no longer an
option in modern network environments. Significant challenges arise with
keeping device configurations not only consistent across a network but
also consistent with the needs of services and service features they are
supposed to enable. Additional challenges arise with regard to being
able to rapidly adapt the network as needed and to be able to do so at
scale. At the same time, operations need to be streamlined and automated
wherever possible to not only lower operational expenses but also allow
for rapid reconfiguration of networks at sub-second time scales and to
ensure that networks are delivering their functionality as expected.
Among other things, this requires the ability to consume operational
data, perform analytics, and dynamically take actions in a way that is
aware of context as well as intended outcomes at near real-time
speeds.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

Accordingly, the IETF has begun to address end-to-end management aspects
that go beyond the realm of individual devices in isolation. Examples
include the definition of YANG models for network topology
\[[RFC8345](#RFC8345){.cite .xref}\] or the introduction of service
models used by service orchestration systems and controllers
\[[RFC8309](#RFC8309){.cite .xref}\]. Much of the interest has been
fueled by the discussion about how to manage autonomic networks as
discussed in the ANIMA Working Group. Autonomic networks are driven by
the desire to lower operational expenses and make the management of the
network as a whole more straightforward, putting it at odds with the
need to manage the network one device and one feature at a time.
However, while autonomic networks are intended to exhibit
\"self-management\" properties, they still require input from an
operator or outside system to provide operational guidance and
information about the goals, purposes, and service instances that the
network is to serve.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

This input and operational guidance are commonly referred to as
\"intent,\" and a network that allows network operators to provide their
input using intent is referred to as an \"Intent-Based Network\" (IBN),
while a system that helps implement intent is referred to as an
\"Intent-Based System\" (IBS). Those systems can manifest themselves in
a number of ways \-- for example, as a controller or management system
that is implemented as an application that runs on a server or set of
servers, or as a set of functions that are distributed across a network
and that collectively perform their intent-based
functionality.[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}

However, intent is about more than just enabling a form of operator
interaction with the network that involves higher-layer abstractions. It
is also about the ability to let operators focus on what they want their
desired outcomes to be while leaving details to the IBN (respectively
IBS) about how those outcomes would be achieved. Focusing on the outcome
enables much greater operational efficiency and flexibility at greater
scale, in shorter time scales, and with less dependency on human
activities (and therefore less possibility for mistakes). This also
makes Intent-Based Networking an ideal candidate for artificial
intelligence techniques that can bring about the next level of network
automation \[[CLEMM20](#CLEMM20){.cite
.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-6){.pilcrow}

This vision has since caught on with the industry, leading to a
significant number of solutions that offer Intent-Based Management that
promise network providers to manage networks holistically at a higher
level of abstraction and as a system that happens to consist of
interconnected components as opposed to a set of independent devices
(that happen to be interconnected). Those offerings include IBNs and
IBSs (offering a full life cycle of intent), Software-Defined Network
(SDN) controllers (offering a single point of control and administration
for a network), and network management and Operations Support Systems
(OSSs).[¶](#section-1-7){.pilcrow}

It has been recognized for a long time that comprehensive management
solutions cannot operate only at the level of individual devices and
low-level configurations. In this sense, the vision of intent is not
entirely new. In the past, ITU-T\'s model of a Telecommunications
Management Network (TMN) introduced a set of management layers that
defined a management hierarchy consisting of network element, network,
service, and business management \[[M3010](#M3010){.cite .xref}\].
High-level operational objectives would propagate in a top-down fashion
from upper to lower layers. The associated abstraction hierarchy was
crucial to decompose management complexity into separate areas of
concern. This abstraction hierarchy was accompanied by an information
hierarchy that concerned itself at the lowest level with device-specific
information, but that would, at higher layers, include, for example,
end-to-end service instances. Similarly, the concept of Policy-Based
Network Management (PBNM) has, for a long time, touted the ability to
allow users to manage networks by specifying high-level management
policies, with policy systems automatically \"rendering\" those
policies, i.e., breaking them down into low-level configurations and
control logic.[¶](#section-1-8){.pilcrow}

As a note, in the context of this document, \"users\" generally refers
to operators and administrators who are responsible for the management
and operation of communication services and networking infrastructures,
not to \"end users\" of communication
services.[¶](#section-1-9.1){.pilcrow}

What has been missing, however, is putting these concepts into a more
current context and updating them to account for current technology
trends. This document clarifies the concepts behind intent. It
differentiates intent from related concepts. It also provides an
overview of first-order principles of Intent-Based Networking as well as
the associated functionality. The goal is to contribute to a common and
shared understanding that can be used as a foundation to articulate
research and engineering problems in the area of Intent-Based
Networking.[¶](#section-1-10){.pilcrow}

It should be noted that the articulation of IBN-related research
problems is beyond the scope of this document. However, it should be
recognized that Intent-Based Networking has become an important topic in
the research community. Per IEEE Xplore
\[[IEEEXPLORE](#IEEEXPLORE){.cite .xref}\], as of December 2021, in the
past decade since 2012, there have been 1138 papers with the index term
\"intent\", of which 411 specifically mention networking. The time
period since 2020 alone accounts for 316 papers on intent and 153 for
intent networking, indicating accelerating interest. In addition,
workshops dedicated to this theme are beginning to appear, such as the
IEEE International Workshop on Intent-Based Networking
\[[WIN21](#WIN21){.cite .xref}\], as well as various special journal
issues \[[IEEE-TITS21](#IEEE-TITS21){.cite .xref}\]. A survey of current
intent-driven networking research has been published in
\[[PANG20](#PANG20){.cite .xref}\], listing among the most pressing
current research challenges aspects such as intent translation and
understanding, intent interfaces, and
security.[¶](#section-1-11){.pilcrow}

The following section provides an overview of the concept of intent and
Intent-Based Management. It also provides an overview of the related
concepts of service models and policies (and Policy-Based Network
Management), and explains how they relate to intent and Intent-Based
Management.[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

### [3.1.](#section-3.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Intent and Intent-Based Management](#name-intent-and-intent-based-man){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-intent-and-intent-based-man}

In this document, intent is defined as a set of operational goals (that
a network is supposed to meet) and outcomes (that a network is supposed
to deliver) defined in a declarative manner without specifying how to
achieve or implement them.[¶](#section-3.1-1){.pilcrow}

The term \"intent\" was first introduced in the context of Autonomic
Networks, where it is defined as \"an abstract, high-level policy used
to operate the network\" \[[RFC7575](#RFC7575){.cite .xref}\]. According
to this definition, an intent is a specific type of policy provided by a
user to provide guidance to the Autonomic Network that would otherwise
operate without human intervention. However, to avoid using intent
simply as a synonym for policy, a distinction that differentiates intent
clearly from other types of policies needs to be
introduced.[¶](#section-3.1-2){.pilcrow}

One note regarding the use of the plural form of \"intent\": in the
English language, the term \"intent\" is generally used only in singular
form. However, the specification of intent as a whole usually involves
the specification of several individual statements of intent, or intent
statements. In some cases, intent statements are colloquially also
referred to as \"intents\", although in general, the use of the term
\"intents\" is discouraged.[¶](#section-3.1-3.1){.pilcrow}

Intent-Based Management aims to lead towards networks that are
fundamentally simpler to manage and operate, requiring only minimal
outside intervention. Networks, even when they are autonomic, are not
clairvoyant and have no way of automatically knowing particular
operational goals nor which instances of networking services to support.
In other words, they do not know what the intent of the network provider
is that gives the network the purpose of its being. This still needs to
be communicated to the network by what informally constitutes intent.
That being said, the concept of intent is not limited just to autonomic
networks, such as networks that feature an Autonomic Control Plane
\[[RFC8994](#RFC8994){.cite .xref}\], but applies to any
network.[¶](#section-3.1-4){.pilcrow}

Intent defines goals and outcomes in a manner that is purely
declarative, specifying what to accomplish, not how to achieve it.
Intent thus applies several important concepts
simultaneously:[¶](#section-3.1-5){.pilcrow}

-   [It provides data abstraction: Users do not need to be concerned
    with low-level device configuration and nerd
    knobs.[¶](#section-3.1-6.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.1-6.1}
-   [It provides functional abstraction from particular management and
    control logic: Users do not need to be concerned even with how to
    achieve a given intent. What is specified is the desired outcome
    with the IBS automatically figuring out a course of action (e.g.,
    using an algorithm or applying a set of rules derived from the
    intent) for how to achieve the
    outcome.[¶](#section-3.1-6.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.1-6.2}

The following are some examples of intent, expressed in natural language
for the sake of clarity (actual interfaces used to convey intent may
differ):[¶](#section-3.1-7){.pilcrow}

-   [\"Steer networking traffic originating from endpoints in one
    geography away from a second geography, unless the destination lies
    in that second geography.\" (states what to achieve, not
    how.)[¶](#section-3.1-8.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.1-8.1}
-   [\"Avoid routing networking traffic originating from a given set of
    endpoints (or associated with a given customer) through a particular
    vendor\'s equipment, even if this occurs at the expense of reduced
    service levels.\" (states what to achieve, not how, providing
    additional guidance for how to trade off between different goals
    when necessary.)[¶](#section-3.1-8.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.1-8.2}
-   [\"Maximize network utilization even if it means trading off service
    levels (such as latency, loss) unless service levels have
    deteriorated 20% or more from their historical mean.\" (a desired
    outcome, with a set of constraints for additional guidance, that
    does not specify how to achieve
    this.)[¶](#section-3.1-8.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.1-8.3}
-   [\"Ensure VPN services have path protection at all times for all
    paths.\" (a desired outcome of which it may not be clear how it can
    be precisely
    accommodated.)[¶](#section-3.1-8.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.1-8.4}
-   [\"Generate in situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance
    (OAM) data and network telemetry for later offline analysis whenever
    significant fluctuations in latency across a path are observed.\"
    (goes beyond event-condition-action by not being specific about what
    constitutes \"significant\" and what specific data to
    collect.)[¶](#section-3.1-8.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.1-8.5}

In contrast, the following are examples of what would not constitute
intent (again, expressed in natural language for the sake of
clarity):[¶](#section-3.1-9){.pilcrow}

-   [\"Configure a given interface with an IP address.\" (This would be
    considered device configuration and fiddling with configuration
    knobs, not
    intent.)[¶](#section-3.1-10.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.1-10.1}
-   [\"When interface utilization exceeds a specific threshold, emit an
    alert.\" (This would be a rule that can help support network

-   [\"Configure a VPN with a tunnel from A to B over path P.\" (This
    would be considered as a configuration of a

-   [\"Deny traffic to prefix P1 unless it is traffic from prefix P2.\"
    (This would be an example of an access policy or a firewall rule,
    not intent.)[¶](#section-3.1-10.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.1-10.4}

In networks, in particular in networks that are deemed autonomic, intent
should ideally be rendered by the network itself, i.e., translated into
device-specific rules and courses of action. Ideally, intent would not
need to be orchestrated or broken down by a higher-level, centralized
system but by the network devices themselves using a combination of
distributed algorithms and local device abstractions. In this idealized
vision, because intent holds for the network as a whole, intent should
ideally be automatically disseminated across all devices in the network,
which can themselves decide whether they need to act on
it.[¶](#section-3.1-11){.pilcrow}

However, such decentralization will not be practical in all cases.
Certain functions will need to be at least conceptually centralized. For
example, users may require a single conceptual point of interaction with
the network. The system providing this point acts as the operational
front end for the network through which users can direct requests at the
network and from which they can receive updates about the network. It
may appear to users as a single system, even if it is implemented in a
distributed manner. In turn, it interacts with and manages other systems
in the network as needed in order to realize (i.e., to fulfill and to
assure) the desired intent. Likewise, the vast majority of network
devices may be intent-agnostic and focus only (for example) on the
actual forwarding of packets. Many devices may also be constrained in
terms of their processing resources. This means that not every device
may be able to act on intent on its own. Again, intent in those cases
can be achieved by a separate system that performs the required
actions.[¶](#section-3.1-12){.pilcrow}

Another reason to provide intent functionality from a conceptually
centralized point is in cases where the realization of a certain type of
intent benefits from global knowledge of a network and its state. In
many cases, such a global view may be impractical to maintain by
individual devices, for example due to the volume of data and time lags
that are involved. It may even be impractical for devices to simply
access such a view from another remote system if such were
available.[¶](#section-3.1-13){.pilcrow}

All of this implies that in many cases, certain intent functionality
needs to be provided by functions that are specialized for that purpose
and that may be provided by dedicated systems (which in some cases could
also co-host other networking functions). For example, the translation
of specific types of intent into corresponding courses of action and
algorithms to achieve the desired outcomes may need to be provided by
such specialized functions. Of course, to avoid single points of
failure, the implementation and hosting of such functions may still be
distributed even if conceptually
centralized.[¶](#section-3.1-14){.pilcrow}

Regardless of its particular implementation in a centralized or
decentralized manner, an IBN is a network that can be managed using
intent. This means that it is able to recognize and ingest intent of an
operator or user and configure and adapt itself according to the user
intent, achieving an intended outcome (i.e., a desired state or
behavior) without requiring the user to specify the detailed technical
steps for how to achieve the outcome. Instead, the IBN will be able to
figure out on its own how to achieve the outcome. Similarly, an IBS is a
system that allows users to manage a network using intent. Such a system
will serve as a point of interaction with users and implement the
functionality that is necessary to achieve the intended outcomes,
interacting for that purpose with the network as
required.[¶](#section-3.1-15){.pilcrow}

Other definitions of intent exist, such as \[[TR523](#TR523){.cite
.xref}\]. Intent there is simply defined as a declarative interface that
is typically provided by a controller. It implies the presence of a
centralized function that renders the intent into lower-level policies
or instructions and orchestrates them across the network. While this is
certainly one way of implementation, the definition that is presented
here is more encompassing and ambitious, as it emphasizes the importance
of managing the network by specifying desired outcomes without the
specific steps to be taken in order to achieve the outcome. A controller
API that simply provides abstraction at the network level is more
limited and would not necessarily qualify as intent. Likewise, ingestion
and recognition of intent may not necessarily occur via an API based on
function invocations and simple request-response interactions but may
involve other types of human-machine interactions such as dialogs to
provide clarifications and refinements to
requests.[¶](#section-3.1-16){.pilcrow}

A service model is a model that represents a service that is provided by
a network to a user. Per \[[RFC8309](#RFC8309){.cite .xref}\], a service
model describes a service and its parameters in a portable and
implementation-agnostic way that can be used independently of the
equipment and operating environment on which the service is realized.
Two subcategories are distinguished: a \"Customer Service Model\"
describes an instance of a service as provided to a customer, possibly
associated with a service order, and a \"Service Delivery Model\"
describes how a service is instantiated over existing networking
infrastructure.[¶](#section-3.2.1-1){.pilcrow}

An example of a service could be a Layer 3 VPN service
\[[RFC8299](#RFC8299){.cite .xref}\], a Network Slice
\[[NETWORK-SLICE](#I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices){.cite .xref}\], or
residential Internet access. Service models represent service instances
as entities in their own right. Services have their own parameters,
actions, and life cycles. Typically, service instances can be bound to
end users of communication services who might be billed for the services
provided.[¶](#section-3.2.1-2){.pilcrow}

Instantiating a service typically involves multiple
aspects:[¶](#section-3.2.1-3){.pilcrow}

-   [A user (or northbound system) needs to define and/or request a
    service to be

    validated and assured to ensure that the network indeed delivers the
    service as
    requested.[¶](#section-3.2.1-4.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.2.1-4.5}

The realization of service models involves a system, such as a
controller, that provides provisioning logic. This includes breaking
down high-level service abstractions into lower-level device
abstractions, identifying and allocating system resources, and
orchestrating individual provisioning steps. Orchestration operations
are generally conducted using a \"push\" model in which the
controller/manager initiates the operations as required, then pushes
down the specific configurations to the device and validates whether the
new changes have been accepted and the new operational/derived states
are achieved and in sync with the intent/desired state. In addition to
instantiating and creating new instances of a service, updating,
modifying, and decommissioning services also need to be supported. The
device itself typically remains agnostic to the service or the fact that
its resources or configurations are part of a service/concept at a
higher layer.[¶](#section-3.2.1-5){.pilcrow}

Instantiated service models map to instantiated lower-layer network and
device models. Examples include instances of paths or instances of
specific port configurations. The service model typically also models
dependencies and layering of services over lower-layer networking
resources that are used to provide services. This facilitates management
by allowing to follow dependencies for troubleshooting activities and to
perform impact analysis in which events in the network are assessed
regarding their impact on services and customers. Services are typically
orchestrated and provisioned top to bottom, which also facilitates
keeping track of the assignment of network resources (composition),
while troubleshooted bottom up (decomposition). Service models might
also be associated with other data that does not concern the network but
provides business context. This includes things such as customer data
(such as billing information), service orders and service catalogs,
tariffs, service contracts, and Service Level Agreements (SLAs),
including contractual agreements regarding remediation
actions.[¶](#section-3.2.1-6){.pilcrow}

\[[SERVICE-MAPPING-YANG](#I-D.ietf-teas-te-service-mapping-yang){.cite
.xref}\] is an example of a data model that provides a mapping for
customer service models (e.g., the L3VPN Service Model) to Traffic
Engineering (TE) models (e.g., the TE Tunnel or the Abstraction and
Control of Traffic Engineered Networks Virtual Network
model).[¶](#section-3.2.1-7){.pilcrow}

Like intent, service models provide higher layers of abstraction.
Service models are often also complemented with mappings that capture
dependencies between service and device or network configurations.
Unlike intent, service models do not allow to define a desired
\"outcome\" that would be automatically maintained by an IBS. Instead,
the management of service models requires the development of
sophisticated algorithms and control logic by network providers or
system integrators.[¶](#section-3.2.1-8){.pilcrow}

#### [3.2.2.](#section-3.2.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Policy and Policy-Based Network Management](#name-policy-and-policy-based-net){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-policy-and-policy-based-net}

Policy-Based Network Management (PBNM) is a management paradigm that
separates the rules that govern the behavior of a system from the
functionality of the system. It promises to reduce maintenance costs of
information and communication systems while improving flexibility and
runtime adaptability. It is present today at the heart of a multitude of
management architectures and paradigms, including SLA-driven,
business-driven, autonomous, adaptive, and self-\* management
\[[BOUTABA07](#BOUTABA07){.cite .xref}\]. The interested reader is asked
to refer to the rich set of existing literature, which includes this and
many other references. In the following, we will only provide a
much-abridged and distilled overview.[¶](#section-3.2.2-1){.pilcrow}

At the heart of policy-based management is the concept of a policy.
Multiple definitions of policy exist: \"Policies are rules governing the
choices in the behavior of a system\" \[[SLOMAN94](#SLOMAN94){.cite
.xref}\]. \"Policy is a set of rules that are used to manage and control
the changing and/or maintaining of the state of one or more managed
objects\" \[[STRASSNER03](#STRASSNER03){.cite .xref}\]. Common to most
definitions is the definition of a policy as a \"rule.\" Typically, the
definition of a rule consists of an event (whose occurrence triggers a
rule), a set of conditions (which get assessed and which must be true
before any actions are actually \"fired\"), and finally, a set of one or
more actions that are carried out when the condition
holds.[¶](#section-3.2.2-2){.pilcrow}

Policy-based management can be considered an imperative management
paradigm: Policies precisely specify what needs to be done when and in
which circumstance. By using policies, management can, in effect, be
defined as a set of simple control loops. This makes policy-based
management a suitable technology to implement autonomic behavior that
can exhibit self-\* management properties, including self-configuration,
self-healing, self-optimization, and self-protection. This is
notwithstanding the fact that policy-based management may make use of
the concept of abstractions (such as, \"Bob gets gold service\") that
hide from the user the specifics of how that abstraction is rendered in
a particular deployment.[¶](#section-3.2.2-3){.pilcrow}

Policies typically involve a certain degree of abstraction in order to
cope with the heterogeneity of networking devices. Rather than having a
device-specific policy that defines events, conditions, and actions in
terms of device-specific commands, parameters, and data models, a policy
is defined at a higher level of abstraction involving a canonical model
of systems and devices to which the policy is to be applied. A policy
agent on a controller or the device subsequently \"renders\" the policy,
i.e., translates the canonical model into a device-specific
representation. This concept allows applying the same policy across a
wide range of devices without needing to define multiple variants. In
other words, policy definition is decoupled from policy instantiation
and policy enforcement. This enables operational scale and allows
network operators and authors of policies to think in higher terms of
abstraction than device specifics and be able to reuse the same,
high-level definition across different networking domains, WAN, data
center (DC), or public cloud.[¶](#section-3.2.2-4){.pilcrow}

PBNM is typically \"push-based\": Policies are pushed onto devices where
they are rendered and enforced. The push operations are conducted by a
manager or controller that is responsible for deploying policies across
the network and monitoring their proper operation. That being said,
other policy architectures are possible. For example, policy-based
management can also include a pull component in which the decision
regarding which action to take is delegated to a so-called Policy
Decision Point (PDP). This PDP can reside outside the managed device
itself and has typically global visibility and context with which to
make policy decisions. Whenever a network device observes an event that
is associated with a policy but lacks the full definition of the policy
or the ability to reach a conclusion regarding the expected action, it
reaches out to the PDP for a decision (reached, for example, by deciding
on an action based on various conditions). Subsequently, the device
carries out the decision as returned by the PDP; the device \"enforces\"
the policy and hence acts as a PEP (Policy Enforcement Point). Either
way, PBNM architectures typically involve a central component from which
policies are deployed across the network and/or policy decisions
served.[¶](#section-3.2.2-5){.pilcrow}

Like intent, policies provide a higher layer of abstraction. Policy
systems are also able to capture dynamic aspects of the system under
management through the specification of rules that allow defining
various triggers for specific courses of action. Unlike intent, the
definition of those rules (and courses of action) still needs to be
articulated by users. Since the intent is unknown, conflict resolution
within or between policies requires interactions with a user or some
kind of logic that resides outside of PBNM. In that sense, policy
constitutes a lower level of abstraction than intent, and it is
conceivable for IBSs to generate policies that are subsequently deployed
by a PBNM system, allowing PBNM to support Intent-Based
Networking.[¶](#section-3.2.2-6){.pilcrow}

What intent, policy, and service models all have in common is the fact
that they involve a higher layer of abstraction of a network that does
not involve device specifics, generally transcends individual devices,
and makes the network easier to manage for applications and human users
compared to having to manage the network one device at a time. Beyond
that, differences emerge.[¶](#section-3.2.3-1){.pilcrow}

Summarized differences:[¶](#section-3.2.3-2){.pilcrow}

-   [A service model is a data model that is used to describe instances
    of services that are provided to customers. A service model has
    dependencies on lower-level models (device and network models) when
    describing how the service is mapped onto the underlying network and
    IT infrastructure. Instantiating a service model requires
    orchestration by a system; the logic for how to
    orchestrate/manage/provide the service model and how to map it onto
    underlying resources is not included as part of the model
    itself.[¶](#section-3.2.3-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.2.3-3.1}
-   [Policy is a set of rules, typically modeled around a variation of
    events/conditions/actions, used to express simple control loops that
    can be rendered by devices without requiring intervention by the
    outside system. Policies let users define what to do under what
    circumstances, but they do not specify the desired
    outcome.[¶](#section-3.2.3-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.2.3-3.2}
-   [Intent is a high-level, declarative goal that operates at the level
    of a network and services it provides, not individual devices. It is
    used to define outcomes and high-level operational goals, without
    specifying how those outcomes should be achieved or how goals should
    specifically be satisfied, and without the need to enumerate
    specific events, conditions, and actions. Which algorithm or rules
    to apply can be automatically \"learned/derived from intent\" by the
    IBS. In the context of autonomic networking, intent is ideally
    rendered by the network itself; also, the dissemination of intent
    across the network and any required coordination between nodes is
    resolved by the network without the need for external
    systems.[¶](#section-3.2.3-3.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.2.3-3.3}

One analogy to capture the difference between policy-based systems and
IBSs is that of Expert Systems and Learning Systems in the field of
Artificial Intelligence. Expert Systems operate on knowledge bases with
rules that are supplied by users, analogous to policy systems whose
policies are supplied by users. They are able to make automatic
inferences based on those rules but are not able to \"learn\" new rules
on their own. Learning Systems (popularized by deep learning and neural
networks), on the other hand, are able to learn without depending on
user programming or articulation of rules. However, they do require a
learning or training phase requiring large data sets; explanations of
actions that the system actually takes provide a different set of
challenges. Analogous to IBSs, users focus on what they would like the
learning system to accomplish but not how to do
it.[¶](#section-3.2.3-4){.pilcrow}

## [4.](#section-4){.section-number .selfRef} [Principles](#name-principles){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-principles}

The following main operating principles allow characterizing the
intent-based/-driven/-defined nature of a
system.[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

1.  ::: {#section-4-2.1}
    Single Source of Truth (SSoT) and Single Version of Truth (SVoT).
    The SSoT is an essential component of an IBS as it enables several
    important operations. The set of validated intent expressions is the
    system\'s SSoT. SSoT and the records of the operational states
    enable comparing the intended/desired state and actual/operational
    states of the system and determining drift between them. SSoT and
    the drift information provide the basis for corrective actions. If
    the IBS is equipped with the means to predict states, it can further
    develop strategies to anticipate, plan, and pro-actively act on any
    diverging trends with the aim to minimize their impact. Beyond
    providing a means for consistent system operation, SSoT also allows
    for better traceability to validate if/how the initial intent and
    associated business goals have been properly met in order to
    evaluate the impacts of changes in the intent parameters and impacts
    and effects of the events occurring in the
    system.[¶](#section-4-2.1.1){.pilcrow}

    Single Version (or View) of Truth derives from the SSoT and can be
    used to perform other operations such as querying, polling, or
    filtering measured and correlated information in order to create
    so-called \"views.\" These views can serve the users of the IBS. In
    order to create intent statements as single sources of truth, the
    IBS must follow well-specified and well-documented processes and
    models. In other contexts, SSoT is also referred to as the
    invariance of the intent \[[LENROW15](#LENROW15){.cite
    .xref}\].[¶](#section-4-2.1.2){.pilcrow}
    :::

2.  ::: {#section-4-2.2}
    One touch but not one shot. In an ideal IBS, the user expresses
    intent in one form or another, and then the system takes over all
    subsequent operations (one touch). A zero-touch approach could also
    be imagined in the case where the IBS has the capabilities or means
    to recognize intentions in any form of data. However, the zero- or
    one-touch approach should not distract from the fact that reaching
    the state of a well-formed and valid intent expression is not a
    one-shot process. On the contrary, the interfacing between the user
    and the IBS could be designed as an interactive and iterative
    process. Depending on the level of abstraction, the intent
    expressions may initially contain more or less implicit parts and
    imprecise or unknown parameters and constraints. The role of the IBS
    is to parse, understand, and refine the intent expression to reach a
    well-formed and valid intent expression that can be further used by
    the system for the fulfillment and assurance operations. An intent
    refinement process could use a combination of iterative steps
    involving the user to validate the proposed refined intent and to
    ask the user for clarifications in case some parameters or variables
    could not be deduced or learned by means of the system itself. In
    addition, the IBS will need to moderate between conflicting intent,
    helping users to properly choose between intent alternatives that
    may have different ramifications.[¶](#section-4-2.2.1){.pilcrow}
    :::

3.  [Autonomy and Supervision. A desirable goal for an IBS is to offer a
    high degree of flexibility and freedom on both the user side and
    system side, e.g., by giving the user the ability to express intent
    using the user\'s own terms, by supporting different forms of
    expression for individual statements of intent and being capable of
    refining the intent expressions to well-formed and exploitable
    expressions. The dual principle of autonomy and supervision allows
    operating a system that will have the necessary levels of autonomy
    to conduct its tasks and operations without requiring the
    intervention of the user and taking its own decisions (within its
    areas of concern and span of control) as how to perform and meet the
    user expectations in terms of performance and quality, while at the
    same time providing the proper level of supervision to satisfy the
    user requirements for reporting and escalation of relevant
    information.[¶](#section-4-2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-4-2.3}

4.  [Learning. An IBS is a learning system. In contrast to an imperative
    type of system, such as Event-Condition-Action policy rules, where
    the user defines beforehand the expected behavior of the system to
    various events and conditions, in an IBS, the user only declares
    what the system is supposed to achieve and not how to achieve these
    goals. There is thus a transfer of reasoning/rationality from the
    human (domain knowledge) to the system. This transfer of cognitive
    capability also implies the availability in the IBS of capabilities
    or means for learning, reasoning, and knowledge representation and
    management. The learning abilities of an IBS can apply to different
    tasks such as optimization of the intent rendering or intent
    refinement processes. The fact that an IBS is a continuously
    evolving system creates the condition for continuous learning and
    optimization. Other cognitive capabilities such as planning can also
    be leveraged in an IBS to anticipate or forecast future system state
    and response to changes in intent or network conditions and thus
    elaboration of plans to accommodate the changes while preserving
    system stability and efficiency in a trade-off with cost and
    robustness of
    operations.[¶](#section-4-2.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-4-2.4}

5.  [Capability exposure. Capability exposure consists in the need for
    expressive network capabilities, requirements, and constraints to be
    able to compose/decompose intent and map the user\'s expectations to
    the system
    capabilities.[¶](#section-4-2.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-4-2.5}

6.  [Abstract and outcome-driven. Users do not need to be concerned with
    how intent is achieved and are empowered to think in terms of
    outcomes. In addition, they can refer to concepts at a higher level
    of abstractions, independent, e.g., of vendor-specific
    renderings.[¶](#section-4-2.6){.pilcrow}]{#section-4-2.6}

The described principles are perhaps the most prominent, but they are
not an exhaustive list. There are additional aspects to consider, such
as:[¶](#section-4-3){.pilcrow}

-   [Intent targets are not individual devices but typically
    aggregations (such as groups of devices adhering to a common
    criteria, such as devices of a particular role) or abstractions
    (such as service types, service instances, or
    topologies).[¶](#section-4-4.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-4-4.1}
-   [Abstraction and inherent virtualization: agnostic to implementation
    details.[¶](#section-4-4.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-4-4.2}
-   [Human-tailored network interaction: IBN should speak the language
    of the user as opposed to requiring the user to speak the language
    of the device/network.[¶](#section-4-4.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-4-4.3}
-   [Explainability as an important IBN function, detection and
    IBN-aided resolution of conflicting intent, and reconciliation of
    what the user wants and what the network can actually

-   [Inherent support, verification, and assurance of
    trust.[¶](#section-4-4.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-4-4.5}

All of these principles and considerations have implications on the
design of IBSs and their supporting architecture. Accordingly, they need
to be considered when deriving functional and operational
requirements.[¶](#section-4-5){.pilcrow}

Intent-Based Networking involves a wide variety of functions that can be
roughly divided into two categories:[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

-   [Intent Fulfillment provides functions and interfaces that allow
    users to communicate intent to the network and that perform the
    necessary actions to ensure that intent is achieved. This includes
    algorithms to determine proper courses of action and functions that
    learn to optimize outcomes over time. In addition, it also includes
    functions such as any required orchestration of coordinated
    configuration operations across the network and rendering of
    higher-level abstractions into lower-level parameters and control
    knobs.[¶](#section-5-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-5-2.1}
-   [Intent Assurance provides functions and interfaces that allow users
    to validate and monitor that the network is indeed adhering to and
    complying with intent. This is necessary to assess the effectiveness
    of actions taken as part of fulfillment, providing important
    feedback that allows those functions to be trained or tuned over
    time to optimize outcomes. In addition, Intent Assurance is
    necessary to address \"intent drift.\" Intent is not meant to be
    transactional, i.e., \"set and forget\", but is expected to remain
    in effect over time (unless explicitly stated otherwise). Intent
    drift occurs when a system originally meets the intent, but over
    time gradually allows its behavior to change or be affected until it
    no longer does or does so in a less effective
    manner.[¶](#section-5-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-5-2.2}

The following sections provide a more comprehensive overview of those
functions.[¶](#section-5-3){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-5.1 .section}
### [5.1.](#section-5.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Intent Fulfillment](#name-intent-fulfillment){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-intent-fulfillment}

Intent fulfillment is concerned with the functions that take intent from
its origination by a user (generally, an administrator of the
responsible organization) to its realization in the
network.[¶](#section-5.1-1){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-5.1.1 .section}
#### [5.1.1.](#section-5.1.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Intent Ingestion and Interaction with Users](#name-intent-ingestion-and-intera){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-intent-ingestion-and-intera}

The first set of functions is concerned with \"ingesting\" intent, i.e.,
obtaining intent through interactions with users. They provide functions
that recognize intent from interaction with the user as well as
functions that allow users to refine their intent and articulate it in
such ways so that it becomes actionable by an IBS. Typically, those
functions go beyond those provided by a non-intent-based API, although
non-intent-based APIs may also still be provided (and needed for
interactions beyond human users, i.e., with other machines). Many cases
would also involve a set of intuitive and easy-to-navigate workflows
that guide users through the intent ingestion phase, making sure that
all inputs that are necessary for intent modeling and consecutive
translation have been gathered. They may support unconventional
human-machine interactions, in which a human will not simply give
commands but instead a human-machine dialog is used to provide
clarifications, to explain ramifications and trade-offs, and to
facilitate refinements.[¶](#section-5.1.1-1){.pilcrow}

The goal is ultimately to make IBSs as easy and natural to use and
interact with as possible, in particular allowing human users to
interact with the IBS in ways that do not involve a steep learning curve
that forces the user to learn the \"language\" of the system. Ideally,
it will be the IBSs that are increasingly able to learn how to
understand the user, as opposed to the other way around. Of course,
further research will be required to make this a
reality.[¶](#section-5.1.1-2){.pilcrow}
:::

::: {#section-5.1.2 .section}
#### [5.1.2.](#section-5.1.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Intent Translation](#name-intent-translation){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-intent-translation}

A second set of functions needs to translate user intent into courses of
action and requests to take against the network, which will be
meaningful to network configuration and provisioning systems. These
functions lie at the core of IBS, bridging the gap between interaction
with users on the one hand and the management and operations side that
will need to orchestrate provisioning and configuration across the
network.[¶](#section-5.1.2-1){.pilcrow}

Beyond merely breaking down a higher layer of abstraction (intent) into
a lower layer of abstraction (policies and device configuration), Intent
Translation functions can be complemented with functions and algorithms
that perform optimizations and that are able to learn and improve over
time in order to result in the best outcomes, specifically in cases
where multiple ways of achieving those outcomes are conceivable. For
example, satisfying an intent may involve computation of paths and other
parameters that will need to be configured across the network.
Heuristics and algorithms to do so may evolve over time to optimize
outcomes that may depend on a myriad of dynamic network conditions and
context.[¶](#section-5.1.2-2){.pilcrow}
:::

::: {#section-5.1.3 .section}
#### [5.1.3.](#section-5.1.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Intent Orchestration](#name-intent-orchestration){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-intent-orchestration}

A third set of functions deals with the actual configuration and
provisioning steps that need to be orchestrated across the network and
that were determined by the previous intent translation
step.[¶](#section-5.1.3-1){.pilcrow}
:::
:::

::: {#section-5.2 .section}
### [5.2.](#section-5.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Intent Assurance](#name-intent-assurance){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-intent-assurance}

Intent Assurance is concerned with the functions that are necessary to
ensure that the network indeed complies with the desired intent once it
has been fulfilled.[¶](#section-5.2-1){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-5.2.1 .section}
#### [5.2.1.](#section-5.2.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Monitoring](#name-monitoring){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-monitoring}

A first set of assurance functions monitors and observes the network and
its exhibited behavior. This includes all the usual assurance functions
such as monitoring the network for events and performance outliers,
performing measurements to assess service levels that are being
delivered, and generating and collecting telemetry data. Monitoring and
observation are required as the basis for the next set of functions that
assess whether the observed behavior is in fact in compliance with the
behavior that is expected based on the
intent.[¶](#section-5.2.1-1){.pilcrow}
:::

::: {#section-5.2.2 .section}
#### [5.2.2.](#section-5.2.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Intent Compliance Assessment](#name-intent-compliance-assessmen){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-intent-compliance-assessmen}

At the core of Intent Assurance are functions that compare the actual
network behavior that is being monitored and observed with the intended
behavior that is expected per the intent and is held by SSoT. These
functions continuously assess and validate whether the observation
indicates compliance with intent. This includes assessing the
effectiveness of intent fulfillment actions, including verifying that
the actions had the desired effect and assessing the magnitude of the
effect as applicable. It can also include functions that perform
analysis and aggregation of raw observation data. The results of the
assessment can be fed back to facilitate learning functions that
optimize outcomes.[¶](#section-5.2.2-1){.pilcrow}

Intent compliance assessment also includes assessing whether intent
drift occurs over time. Intent drift can be caused by a control plane or
lower-level management operations that inadvertently cause behavior
changes that conflict with intent that was orchestrated earlier. IBSs
and Networks need to be able to detect when such drift occurs or is
about to occur as well as assess the severity of the
drift.[¶](#section-5.2.2-2){.pilcrow}
:::

::: {#section-5.2.3 .section}
#### [5.2.3.](#section-5.2.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Intent Compliance Actions](#name-intent-compliance-actions){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-intent-compliance-actions}

When intent drift occurs or network behavior is inconsistent with
desired intent, functions that are able to trigger corrective actions
are needed. This includes actions needed to resolve intent drift and
bring the network back into compliance. Alternatively, and where
necessary, reporting functions need to be triggered that alert operators
and provide them with the necessary information and tools to react
appropriately, e.g., by helping them articulate modifications to the
original intent to moderate between conflicting
concerns.[¶](#section-5.2.3-1){.pilcrow}
:::

::: {#section-5.2.4 .section}
#### [5.2.4.](#section-5.2.4){.section-number .selfRef} [Abstraction, Aggregation, Reporting](#name-abstraction-aggregation-rep){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-abstraction-aggregation-rep}

The outcome of Intent Assurance needs to be reported back to the user in
ways that allow the user to relate the outcomes to their intent. This
requires a set of functions that are able to analyze, aggregate, and
abstract the results of the observations accordingly. In many cases,
lower-level concepts such as detailed performance statistics and
observations related to low-level settings need to be \"up-leveled\" to
concepts the user can relate to and take action
on.[¶](#section-5.2.4-1){.pilcrow}

The required aggregation and analysis functionality needs to be
complemented with functions that report intent compliance status and
provide adequate summarization and visualization to human
users.[¶](#section-5.2.4-2){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-6 .section}
## [6.](#section-6){.section-number .selfRef} [Life Cycle](#name-life-cycle){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-life-cycle}

Intent is subject to a life cycle: it comes into being, may undergo
changes over the course of time, and may at some point be retracted.
This life cycle is closely tied to various interconnection functions
that are associated with the intent concept.[¶](#section-6-1){.pilcrow}

[Figure 1](#Fig_Lifecycle){.auto .internal .xref} depicts an intent life
cycle and its main functions. The functions were introduced in [Section
5](#Functionality){.auto .internal .xref} and are divided into two
functional (horizontal) planes reflecting the distinction between
fulfillment and assurance. In addition, they are divided into three
(vertical) spaces.[¶](#section-6-2){.pilcrow}

The spaces indicate the different perspectives and interactions with
different roles that are involved in addressing the
functions:[¶](#section-6-3){.pilcrow}

-   [The User Space involves the functions that interface the network
    and IBS with the human user. It involves the functions that allow
    users to articulate and the IBS to recognize that intent. It also
    involves the functions that report back the status of the network
    relative to the intent and that allow users to assess outcomes and
    whether their intent has the desired
    effect.[¶](#section-6-4.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-6-4.1}
-   [The Translation, or Intent-Based System (IBS) Space involves the
    functions that bridge the gap between intent users and the network
    operations infrastructure. This includes the functions used to
    translate an intent into a course of action as well as the
    algorithms that are used to plan and optimize those courses of
    action also in consideration of feedback and observations from the
    network. It also includes the functions to analyze and aggregate
    observations from the network in order to validate compliance with
    the intent and to take corrective actions as necessary. In addition,
    it includes functions that abstract observations from the network in
    ways that relate them to the intent as communicated by users. This
    facilitates the reporting functions in the user
    space.[¶](#section-6-4.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-6-4.2}
-   [The Network Operations Space, finally, involves orchestration,
    configuration, monitoring, and measurement functions, which are used
    to effectuate the rendered intent and observe its effects on the
    network.[¶](#section-6-4.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-6-4.3}

When carefully inspecting the diagram, it becomes apparent that the
intent life cycle, in fact, involves two cycles, or
loops:[¶](#section-6-6){.pilcrow}

-   [The \"inner\" intent control loop between IBS and Network
    Operations space is completely autonomic and does not involve any
    human in the loop. It represents closed-loop automation that
    involves automatic analysis and validation of intent based on
    observations from the network operations space. Those observations
    are fed into the function that plans the rendering of networking
    intent in order to make adjustments as needed in the configuration
    of the network. The loop addresses and counteracts any intent drift
    that may be occurring, using observations to assess the degree of
    the network\'s intent compliance and automatically prompting actions
    to address any discrepancies. Likewise, the loop allows to assess
    the effectiveness of any actions that are taken in order to
    continuously learn and improve how intent needs to be rendered in
    order to achieve the desired
    outcomes.[¶](#section-6-7.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-6-7.1}
-   [The \"outer\" intent control loop extends to the user space. It
    includes the user taking action and adjusting their intent based on
    observations and feedback from the IBS. Intent is thus subjected to
    a life cycle: It comes into being, may undergo refinements,
    modifications, and changes of time, and may at some point in time
    even get retracted.[¶](#section-6-7.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-6-7.2}

## [7.](#section-7){.section-number .selfRef} [Additional Considerations](#name-additional-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-additional-considerations}

Given the popularity of the term \"intent,\" it is tempting to broaden
its use to encompass other related concepts, resulting in
\"intent-washing\" that paints those concepts in a new light by simply
applying new intent terminology to them. A common example concerns
referring to the northbound interface of SDN controllers as \"intent
interface.\" However, in some cases, this actually makes sense not just
as a marketing ploy but as a way to better relate previously existing
and new concepts.[¶](#section-7-1){.pilcrow}

In that sense and with regards to intent, it makes sense to distinguish
various subcategories of intent as follows:[¶](#section-7-2){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

Operational Intent:
:   defines intent related to operational goals of an operator; it
    corresponds to the original \"intent\" term and the concepts defined
    in this document.[¶](#section-7-3.2){.pilcrow}

This document describes concepts and definitions of Intent-Based
Networking. As such, the below security considerations remain high
level, i.e., in the form of principles, guidelines, or requirements.
More detailed security considerations will be described in the documents
that specify the architecture and
functionality.[¶](#section-9-1){.pilcrow}

Security in Intent-Based Networking can apply to different
facets:[¶](#section-9-2){.pilcrow}

-   [Securing the IBS
    itself.[¶](#section-9-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-9-3.1}
-   [Mitigating the effects of erroneous, harmful, or compromised intent
    statements.[¶](#section-9-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-9-3.2}
-   [Expressing security policies or security-related parameters with
    intent statements.[¶](#section-9-3.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-9-3.3}

Securing the IBS aims at making the IBS operationally secure by
implementing security mechanisms and applying security best practices.
In the context of Intent-Based Networking, such mechanisms and practices
may consist of intent verification and validation, operations on intent
by authenticated and authorized users only, and protection against or
detection of tampered statements of intent. Such mechanisms may also
include the introduction of multiple levels of intent. For example,
intent related to securing the network should occur at a \"deeper\"
level that overrides other levels of intent if necessary, and that is
not subject to modification through regular operations but through ones
that are specifically secured. Use of additional mechanisms such as
explanation components that describe the security ramifications and
trade-offs should be considered as well.[¶](#section-9-4){.pilcrow}

Mitigating the effects of erroneous or compromised statements of intent
aims at making the IBS operationally safe by providing checkpoint and
safeguard mechanisms and operating principles. In the context of
Intent-Based Networking, such mechanisms and principles may consist of
the ability to automatically detect unintended, detrimental, or abnormal
behavior; the ability to automatically (and gracefully) roll back or
fall back to a previous \"safe\" state; the ability to prevent or
contain error amplification (due to the combination of a higher degree
of automation and the intrinsic higher degree of freedom, ambiguity, and
implicit information conveyed by intent statements); and dynamic levels
of supervision and reporting to make the user aware of the right
information at the right time with the right level of context. Erroneous
or harmful intent statements may inadvertently propagate and compromise
security. In addition, compromised intent statements (for example,
forged by an inside attacker) may sabotage or harm the network resources
and make them vulnerable to further, larger attacks, e.g., by defeating
certain security mechanisms.[¶](#section-9-5){.pilcrow}

Expressing security policies or security-related parameters as intent
consists of using the intent formalism (a high-level, declarative
abstraction) or part(s) of an intent statement to define
security-related aspects such as:[¶](#section-9-6){.pilcrow}

-   [data governance;[¶](#section-9-7.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-9-7.1}
-   [level(s) of confidentiality in data
    exchange;[¶](#section-9-7.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-9-7.2}
-   [level(s) of availability of system resources, of protection in
    forwarding paths, and of isolation in processing
    functions;[¶](#section-9-7.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-9-7.3}
-   [level(s) of encryption;
    and[¶](#section-9-7.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-9-7.4}
-   [authorized entities for given
    operations.[¶](#section-9-7.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-9-7.5}

The development and introduction of Intent-Based Networking in
operational environments will certainly create new security concerns.
Such security concerns have to be anticipated at the design and
specification time. However, Intent-Based Networking may also be used as
an enabler for better security. For instance, security and privacy rules
could be expressed in a more human-friendly and generic way and be less
technology specific and less complex, leading to fewer low-level
configuration mistakes. The detection of threats or attacks could also
be made more simple and comprehensive thanks to conflict detection at
higher level or at coarser granularity.[¶](#section-9-8){.pilcrow}

More thorough security analyses should be conducted as our understanding
of Intent-Based Networking technology
matures.[¶](#section-9-9){.pilcrow}
