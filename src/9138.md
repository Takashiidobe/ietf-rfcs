## [1.](#section-1){.section-number .selfRef} [Introduction](#name-introduction){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-introduction}

The current Internet is based upon a host-centric networking paradigm,
where hosts are identified with IP addresses and communication is
possible between any pair of hosts. Thus, information in the current
Internet is identified by the name of the host (or server) where the
information is stored. In contrast to host-centric networking, the
primary communication objects in Information-Centric Networking (ICN)
are the named data objects (NDOs), and they are uniquely identified by
location-independent names. Thus, ICN aims for the efficient
dissemination and retrieval of NDOs at a global scale and has been
identified and acknowledged as a promising technology for a future
Internet architecture to overcome the limitations of the current
Internet, such as scalability and mobility
\[[Ahlgren](#Ahlgren){.xref}\] \[[Xylomenos](#Xylomenos){.xref}\]. ICN
also has emerged as a candidate architecture in the Internet of Things
(IoT) environment since IoT focuses on data and information
\[[Baccelli](#Baccelli){.xref}\] \[[Amadeo](#Amadeo){.xref}\]
\[[Quevedo](#Quevedo){.xref}\] \[[Amadeo2](#Amadeo2){.xref}\]
\[[ID.Zhang2](#I-D.irtf-icnrg-icniot){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

Since naming data independently from its current location (where it is
stored) is a primary concept of ICN, how to find any NDO using a
location-independent name is one of the most important design challenges
in ICN. Such ICN routing may comprise three steps
\[[RFC7927](#RFC7927){.xref}\]:[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

\(1\)
:   Name resolution: matches/translates a content name to the locator of
    the content producer or source that can provide the
    content.[¶](#section-1-3.1){.pilcrow}
:   

\(2\)
:   Content request routing: routes the content request towards the
    content\'s location based either on its name or
    locator.[¶](#section-1-3.2){.pilcrow}
:   

\(3\)
:   Content delivery: transfers the content to the
    requester.[¶](#section-1-3.3){.pilcrow}
:   

Among the three steps of ICN routing, this document investigates only
the name resolution step, which translates a content name to the content
locator. In addition, this document covers various possible types of
name resolution in ICN such as one name to another name, name to
locator, name to manifest, name to metadata,
etc.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

The focus of this document is a Name Resolution Service (NRS) itself as
a service or a system in ICN, and it provides the functionalities and
the design considerations for an NRS in ICN as well as the overview of
the NRS approaches in ICN. On the other hand, its companion document
\[[NRSarch](#I-D.irtf-icnrg-nrsarch-considerations){.xref}\] describes
considerations from the perspective of the ICN architecture and routing
system when using an NRS in ICN.[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}

This document represents the consensus of the Information-Centric
Networking Research Group (ICNRG). It has been reviewed extensively by
the Research Group (RG) members who are actively involved in the
research and development of the technology covered by this document. It
is not an IETF product and is not a standard.[¶](#section-1-6){.pilcrow}

## [2.](#section-2){.section-number .selfRef} [Name Resolution Service in ICN](#name-name-resolution-service-in-){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-name-resolution-service-in-}

A Name Resolution Service (NRS) in ICN is defined as the service that
provides the name resolution function for translating an object name
into some other information such as a locator, another name, metadata,
next-hop info, etc. that is used for forwarding the object request. In
other words, an NRS is a service that can be provided by the ICN
infrastructure to help a consumer reach a specific piece of information
(or named data object). The consumer provides an NRS with a persistent
name, and the NRS returns a name or locator (or potentially multiple
names and locators) that can reach a current instance of the requested
object.[¶](#section-2-1){.pilcrow}

The name resolution is a necessary process in ICN routing, although the
name resolution either can be separated from the content request routing
as an explicit process or can be integrated with the content request
routing as an implicit process. The former is referred to as an
\"explicit name resolution approach\", and the latter is referred to as
a \"name-based routing approach\" in this
document.[¶](#section-2-2){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-2.1 .section}
### [2.1.](#section-2.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Explicit Name Resolution Approach](#name-explicit-name-resolution-ap){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-explicit-name-resolution-ap}

An NRS could take the explicit name resolution approach to return the
locators of the content to the client, which will be used by the
underlying network as the identifier to route the client\'s request to
one of the producers or to a copy of the content. There are several ICN
projects that use the explicit name resolution approach, such as
Data-Oriented Network Architecture (DONA)
\[[Koponen](#Koponen){.xref}\], PURSUIT \[[PURSUIT](#PURSUIT){.xref}\],
Network of Information (NetInf) \[[SAIL](#SAIL){.xref}\], MobilityFirst
\[[MF](#MF){.xref}\], IDNet \[[Jung](#Jung){.xref}\], etc. In addition,
the explicit name resolution approach has been allowed for 5G control
planes \[[SA2-5GLAN](#SA2-5GLAN){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2.1-1){.pilcrow}
:::

::: {#section-2.2 .section}
### [2.2.](#section-2.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Name-Based Routing Approach](#name-name-based-routing-approach){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-name-based-routing-approach}

An NRS could take the name-based routing approach, which integrates name
resolution with content request message routing as in Named Data
Networking / Content-Centric Networking (NDN/CCNx)
\[[NDN](#NDN){.xref}\]
\[[CCNx](#CCNx){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2.2-1){.pilcrow}

In cases where the content request also specifies the reverse path, as
in NDN/CCNx, the name resolution mechanism also derives the routing path
for the data. This adds a requirement to the name resolution service to
propagate the request in a way that is consistent with the subsequent
data forwarding. Namely, the request must select a path for the data
based upon finding a copy of the content but also properly delivering
the data.[¶](#section-2.2-2){.pilcrow}
:::

::: {#section-2.3 .section}
### [2.3.](#section-2.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Hybrid Approach](#name-hybrid-approach){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-hybrid-approach}

An NRS could also take hybrid approach. For instance, it can attempt the
name-based routing approach first. If this fails at a certain router,
the router can go back to the explicit name resolution approach. The
hybrid NRS approach also works the other way around: first by performing
explicit name resolution to find the locators of routers, then by
routing the client\'s request using the name-based routing
approach.[¶](#section-2.3-1){.pilcrow}

A hybrid approach would combine name resolution over a subset of routers
on the path with some tunneling in between (say, across an
administrative domain) so that only a few of the nodes in the ICN
network perform name resolution in the name-based routing
approach.[¶](#section-2.3-2){.pilcrow}
:::

::: {#section-2.4 .section}
### [2.4.](#section-2.4){.section-number .selfRef} [Comparisons of Name Resolution Approaches](#name-comparisons-of-name-resolut){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-comparisons-of-name-resolut}

The following compares the explicit name resolution and the name-based
routing approaches in several aspects:[¶](#section-2.4-1){.pilcrow}

-   [Overhead due to the maintenance of the content location: The
    content reachability is dynamic and includes new content being
    cached or content being expired from a cache, content producer
    mobility, etc. Maintaining a consistent view of the content location
    across the network requires some overhead that differs for the name
    resolution approaches. The name-based routing approach may require
    flooding parts of the network for update propagation. In the worst
    case, the name-based routing approach may flood the whole network
    (but mitigating techniques may be used to scope the flooding).
    However, the explicit name resolution approach only requires
    updating propagation in part of the name resolution system (which
    could be an overlay with a limited number of
    nodes).[¶](#section-2.4-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.4-2.1}
-   [Resolution capability: The explicit name resolution approach, if
    designed and deployed with sufficient robustness, can offer at least
    weak guarantees that resolution will succeed for any content name in
    the network if it is registered to the name resolution overlay. In
    the name-based routing approach, content resolution depends on the
    flooding scope of the content names (i.e., content publishing
    message and the resulting name-based routing tables). For example,
    when content is cached, the router may only notify its direct
    neighbors of this information. Thus, only those neighboring routers
    can build a name-based entry for this cached content. But if the
    neighboring routers continue to propagate this information, the
    other nodes are able to direct to this cached copy as
    well.[¶](#section-2.4-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.4-2.2}
-   [Node failure impact: Nodes involved in the explicit name resolution
    approach are the name resolution overlay servers (e.g., resolution
    handlers in DONA), while the nodes involved in the name-based
    routing approach are routers that route messages based on the
    name-based routing tables (e.g., NDN routers). Node failures in the
    explicit name resolution approach may cause some content request
    routing to fail even though the content is available. This problem
    does not exist in the name-based routing approach because other
    alternative paths can be discovered to bypass the failed ICN
    routers, given the assumption that the network is still
    connected.[¶](#section-2.4-2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.4-2.3}
-   [Maintained databases: The storage usage for the explicit name
    resolution approach is different from that of the name-based routing
    approach. The explicit name resolution approach typically needs to
    maintain two databases: name-to-locator mapping in the name
    resolution overlay and routing tables in the routers on the data
    forwarding plane. The name-based routing approach needs to maintain
    only the name-based routing
    tables.[¶](#section-2.4-2.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.4-2.4}

Additionally, some other intermediary step may be included in the name
resolution \-- namely, the mapping of one name to other names \-- in
order to facilitate the retrieval of named content by way of a manifest
\[[Westphal](#Westphal){.xref}\] \[[RFC8569](#RFC8569){.xref}\]. The
manifest is resolved using one of the two above approaches, and it may
include further mapping of names to content and location. The steps for
name resolution then become the following: first, translate the manifest
name into a location of a copy of the manifest, which includes further
names of the content components and potentially locations for the
content, then retrieve the content by using these names and/or location,
potentially resulting in additional name
resolutions.[¶](#section-2.4-3){.pilcrow}

Thus, no matter which approach is taken by an NRS in ICN, the name
resolution is the essential function that shall be provided by the ICN
infrastructure.[¶](#section-2.4-4){.pilcrow}

This section presents the functionalities of an NRS in
ICN.[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

### [3.1.](#section-3.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Support Heterogeneous Name Types](#name-support-heterogeneous-name-){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-support-heterogeneous-name-}

In ICN, a name is used to identify the data object and is bound to it
\[[RFC7927](#RFC7927){.xref}\]. ICN requires uniqueness and persistency
of the name of the data object to ensure the reachability of the object
within a certain scope. There are heterogeneous approaches to designing
ICN naming schemes \[[Bari](#Bari){.xref}\]. Ideally, a name can include
any form of identifier, which can be flat or hierarchical, human
readable or non-readable.[¶](#section-3.1-1){.pilcrow}

Although there are diverse types of naming schemes proposed in the
literature, they all need to provide basic functions for identifying a
data object, supporting named data lookup, and routing. An NRS may
combine the better aspects of different schemes. Basically, an NRS
should be able to support a generic naming schema so that it can resolve
any type of content name, irrespective of whether it is flat,
hierarchical, attribute based, or anything
else.[¶](#section-3.1-2){.pilcrow}

In PURSUIT \[[PURSUIT](#PURSUIT){.xref}\], names are flat, and the
rendezvous functions are defined for an NRS, which is implemented by a
set of rendezvous nodes (RNs), known as the rendezvous network (RENE).
Thus, a name consists of a sequence of scope IDs, and a single
rendezvous ID is routed by the RNs in RENE. Thus, PURSUIT decouples name
resolution and data routing, where the NRS is performed by the
RENE.[¶](#section-3.1-3){.pilcrow}

In MobilityFirst \[[MF](#MF){.xref}\], a name known as a \"Global Unique
Identifier (GUID)\", derived from a human-readable name via a global
naming service, is a flat typed 160-bit string with self-certifying
properties. Thus, MobilityFirst defines a Global Name Resolution Service
(GNRS), which resolves GUIDs to network addresses and decouples name
resolution and data routing similarly to
PURSUIT.[¶](#section-3.1-4){.pilcrow}

In NetInf \[[Dannewitz](#Dannewitz){.xref}\], information objects are
named using Named Information (NI) names \[[RFC6920](#RFC6920){.xref}\],
which consist of an authority part and digest part (content hash). The
NI names can be flat as the authority part is optional. Thus, the NetInf
architecture also includes a Name Resolution System (NRS), which can be
used to resolve NI names to addresses in an underlying routable network
layer.[¶](#section-3.1-5){.pilcrow}

In NDN \[[NDN](#NDN){.xref}\] and CCNx \[[CCNx](#CCNx){.xref}\], names
are hierarchical and may be similar to URLs. Each name component can be
anything, including a human-readable string or a hash value. NDN/CCNx
adopts the name-based routing approach. The NDN router forwards the

### [3.2.](#section-3.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Support Producer Mobility](#name-support-producer-mobility){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-support-producer-mobility}

ICN inherently supports mobility by consumers. Namely, consumer or
client mobility is handled by re-requesting the content in case the
mobility event (say, handover) occurred before receiving the
corresponding content from the network. Since ICN can ensure that
content reception continues without any disruption in ICN applications,
seamless mobility from the consumer\'s point of view can be easily
supported.[¶](#section-3.2-1){.pilcrow}

However, producer mobility does not emerge naturally from the ICN
forwarding model as does consumer mobility. If a producer moves into a
different network location or a different name domain, which is assigned
by another authoritative publisher, it would be difficult for the
mobility management to update Routing Information Base (RIB) and FIB
entries in ICN routers with the new forwarding path in a very short
time. Therefore, various ICN architectures in the literature have
proposed adopting an NRS to achieve the producer or publisher mobility,
where the NRS can be implemented in different ways such as rendezvous
points and/or overlay mapping systems.[¶](#section-3.2-2){.pilcrow}

In NDN \[[Zhang2](#Zhang2){.xref}\], for producer mobility support,
rendezvous mechanisms have been proposed to build interest rendezvous
(RV) with data generated by a mobile producer (MP). This can be
classified into two approaches: chase mobile producer and rendezvous
data. Regarding MP chasing, rendezvous acts as a mapping service that
provides the mapping from the name of the data produced by the MP to the
name of the MP\'s current point of attachment (PoA). Alternatively, the
RV serves as a home agent as in IP mobility support, so the RV enables
the consumer\'s Interest message to tunnel towards the MP at the PoA.
Regarding rendezvous data, the solution involves moving the data
produced by the MP to a data depot instead of forwarding Interest
messages. Thus, a consumer\'s Interest message can be forwarded to
stationary place called a \"data rendezvous\", so it would either return
the data or fetch it using another mapping solution. Therefore, RV or
other mapping functions are in the role of an NRS in
NDN.[¶](#section-3.2-3){.pilcrow}

In \[[Ravindran](#I-D.ravi-icnrg-ccn-forwarding-label){.xref}\], the
forwarding label (FL) object is used to enable identifier (ID) and
locator (LID) namespaces to be split in ICN. Generally, IDs are managed
by applications, while locators are managed by a network administrator
so that IDs are mapped to heterogeneous name schemes and LIDs are mapped
to the network domains or to specific network elements. Thus, the
proposed FL object acts as a locator (LID) and provides the flexibility
to forward Interest messages through a mapping service between IDs and
LIDs. Therefore, the mapping service in control plane infrastructure can
be considered as an NRS in this draft.[¶](#section-3.2-4){.pilcrow}

In MobilityFirst \[[MF](#MF){.xref}\], both consumer and publisher
mobility can be primarily handled by the global name resolution service
(GNRS), which resolves GUIDs to network addresses. Thus, the GNRS must
be updated for mobility support when a network-attached object changes
its point of attachment, which differs from
NDN/CCNx.[¶](#section-3.2-5){.pilcrow}

In NetInf \[[Dannewitz](#Dannewitz){.xref}\], mobility is handled by an
NRS in a very similar way to MobilityFirst.[¶](#section-3.2-6){.pilcrow}

Besides the consumer and producer mobility, ICN also faces challenges to
support the other dynamic features such as multi-homing, migration, and
replication of named resources such as content, devices, and services.
Therefore, an NRS can help to support these dynamic
features.[¶](#section-3.2-7){.pilcrow}

### [3.3.](#section-3.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Support Scalable Routing System](#name-support-scalable-routing-sy){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-support-scalable-routing-sy}

In ICN, the name of data objects is used for routing by either a name
resolution step or a routing table lookup. Thus, routing information for
each data object should be maintained in the routing base, such as RIB
and FIB. Since the number of data objects would be very large, the size
of information bases would be significantly larger as well
\[[RFC7927](#RFC7927){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3.3-1){.pilcrow}

The hierarchical namespace used in CCNx \[[CCNx](#CCNx){.xref}\] and NDN
\[[NDN](#NDN){.xref}\] architectures reduces the size of these tables
through name aggregation and improves the scalability of the routing
system. A flat naming scheme, on the other hand, would aggravate the
scalability problem of the routing system. The non-aggregated name
prefixes injected into the Default Route Free Zone (DFZ) of ICN would
create a more serious scalability problem when compared to the
scalability issues of the IP routing system. Thus, an NRS may play an
important role in the reduction of the routing scalability problem
regardless of the types of namespaces.[¶](#section-3.3-2){.pilcrow}

In \[[Afanasyev](#Afanasyev){.xref}\], in order to address the routing
scalability problem in NDN\'s DFZ, a well-known concept called
\"map-and-encap\" is applied to provide a simple and secure namespace
mapping solution. In the proposed map-and-encap design, data whose name
prefixes do not exist in the DFZ forwarding table can be retrieved by a
distributed mapping system called NDNS, which maintains and looks up the
mapping information from a name to its globally routed prefixes, where
NDNS is a kind of an NRS.[¶](#section-3.3-3){.pilcrow}

### [3.4.](#section-3.4){.section-number .selfRef} [Support Off-Path Caching](#name-support-off-path-caching){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-support-off-path-caching}

Caching in-network is considered to be a basic architectural component
of an ICN architecture. It may be used to provide a level of
quality-of-service (QoS) experience to users to reduce the overall
network traffic, to prevent network congestion and denial-of-service
(DoS) attacks, and to increase availability. Caching approaches can be
categorized into off-path caching and on-path caching based on the
location of caches in relation to the forwarding path from the original
server to the consumer. Off-path caching, also referred to as \"content
replication\" or \"content storing\", aims to replicate content within a
network in order to increase availability, regardless of the
relationship of the location to the forwarding path. Thus, finding
off-path cached objects is not trivial in name-based routing of ICN. In
order to support off-path caches, replicas are usually advertised into a
name-based routing system or into an NRS.[¶](#section-3.4-1){.pilcrow}

In \[[Bayhan](#Bayhan){.xref}\], an NRS is used to find off-path copies
in the network, which may not be accessible via name-based routing
mechanisms. Such a capability can be helpful for an Autonomous System
(AS) to avoid the costly inter-AS traffic for external content more, to
yield higher bandwidth efficiency for intra-AS traffic, and to decrease
the data access latency for a pleasant user
experience.[¶](#section-3.4-2){.pilcrow}

In CCNx 1.0 \[[Mosko2](#Mosko2){.xref}\], the concept of a \"Nameless
Object\", which is a Content Object without a name, is introduced to
provide a means to move content between storage replicas without having
to rename or re-sign the Content Objects for the new name. Nameless
Objects can be addressed by the ContentObjectHash, which is to restrict
Content Object matching by using a SHA-256
hash.[¶](#section-3.5-1){.pilcrow}

An Interest message would still carry a name and a ContentObjectHash,
where a name is used for routing, while a ContentObjectHash is used for
matching. However, on the reverse path, if the Content Object\'s name is
missing, it is a \"Nameless Object\" and only matches against the
ContentObjectHash. Therefore, a consumer needs to resolve the proper
name and hashes through an outside system, which can be considered as an
NRS.[¶](#section-3.5-2){.pilcrow}

file-like contents \[[FLIC](#I-D.irtf-icnrg-flic){.xref}\], manifests
are used as data structures to transport this information. Thus,
manifests may contain hash digests of signed Content Objects or other
manifests so that large Content Objects that represent a large piece of
application data can be collected by using such a
manifest.[¶](#section-3.6-1){.pilcrow}

In order to request Content Objects, a consumer needs to know a manifest
root name to acquire the manifest. In the case of File-Like ICN
Collections (FLIC), a manifest name can be represented by a nameless
root manifest so that an outside system such as an NRS may be involved
to give this information to the consumer.[¶](#section-3.6-2){.pilcrow}

of object transfer protocol, security mechanism, egress interface, etc.

### [4.1.](#section-4.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Resolution Response Time](#name-resolution-response-time){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-resolution-response-time}

The name resolution process should provide a response within a
reasonable amount of time. The response should be either a proper
mapping of the name to a copy of the content or an error message stating
that no such object exists. If the name resolution does not map to a
location, the system may not issue any response, and the client should
set a timer when sending a request so as to consider the resolution
incomplete when the timer expires.[¶](#section-4.1-1){.pilcrow}

The acceptable response delay could be of the order of a round-trip time
between the client issuing the request and the NRS servers that provide
the response. While this RTT may vary greatly depending on the proximity
between the two end points, some upper bound needs to be used.
Especially in some delay-sensitive scenarios such as industrial Internet
and telemedicine, the upper bound of the response delay must be
guaranteed.[¶](#section-4.1-2){.pilcrow}

The response time includes all the steps of the resolution, including
potentially a hop-by-hop resolution or a hierarchical forwarding of the

the requested name (or prefix) with a location. The response can be
either a (prefix, location) pair or the actual forwarding of a request
to a node holding the content, which is then transmitted in
return.[¶](#section-4.2-1){.pilcrow}

An NRS must provide an up-to-date response \-- namely, an NRS should be
updated within a reasonable time when new copies of the content are
being stored in the network. While every transient cache
addition/eviction should not trigger an NRS update, some origin servers
may move and require the NRS to be updated.[¶](#section-4.2-2){.pilcrow}

An NRS must provide mechanisms to update the mapping of the content with
its location. Namely, an NRS must provide a mechanism for a content
provider to add new content, revoke old/dated/obsolete content, and
modify existing content. Any content update should then be propagated
through the NRS system within reasonable
delay.[¶](#section-4.2-3){.pilcrow}

probability if the name-matching content exists in the network,
regardless of its popularity and the number of cached copies existing in
the network. Per [Section 4.1](#res-response){.xref}, some resolutions
may not occur in a timely manner. However, the probability of such an
event should be minimized. The NRS system may provide a probability
(five 9s or five sigmas, for instance) that a resolution will be
satisfied.[¶](#section-4.3-1){.pilcrow}

independently of the specific content properties (content producer,
content popularity, availability of copies, content format, etc.).
Fairness may be defined as a per-request delay to complete the NRS steps
that is agnostic to the properties of the content itself. Fairness may
be defined as well as the number of requests answered per unit of
time.[¶](#section-4.4-1){.pilcrow}

However, it is notable that content (or their associated producer) may
request a different level of QoS from the network (see
\[[RFC9064](#RFC9064){.xref}\], for instance), and this may include the
NRS as well, in which case considerations of fairness may be restricted
to content within the same class of

### [4.5.](#section-4.5){.section-number .selfRef} [Scalability](#name-scalability){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-scalability}

The NRS system must scale up to support a very large user population
(including human users as well as machine-to-machine communications). As
an idea of the scale, it is expected that 50 billion devices will be
connected in 2025 (per ITU projections). The system must be able to
respond to a very large number of requests per unit of time. Message
forwarding and processing, routing table buildup, and name record
propagation must be efficient and scalable.[¶](#section-4.5-1){.pilcrow}

The NRS system must scale up with the number of pieces of content
(content names) and should be able to support a content catalog that is
extremely large. Internet traffic is of the order of zettabytes per year
(10^21^ bytes). Since NRS is associated with actual traffic, the number
of pieces of content should scale with the amount of traffic. Content
size may vary from a few bytes to several GB, so the NRS should be
expected scale up to a catalog of the size of 10^21^ in the near future,
and larger beyond.[¶](#section-4.5-2){.pilcrow}

The NRS system must be able to scale up \-- namely, to add NRS servers
to the NRS system in a way that is transparent to the users. The
addition of a new server should have a limited negative impact on the
other NRS servers (or should have a negative impact on only a small
subset of the NRS servers). The impact of adding new servers may induce
some overhead at the other servers to rebuild a hierarchy or to exchange
messages to include the new server within the service. Further, data may
be shared among the new servers for load balancing or tolerance to
failure. These steps should not disrupt the service provided by the NRS
and should improve the quality of the service in the long
run.[¶](#section-4.5-3){.pilcrow}

The NRS system may support access from a heterogeneity of connection
methods and devices. In particular, the NRS system may support access
from constrained devices, and interactions with the NRS system would not
be too costly. An IoT node, for instance, should be able to access the
NRS system as well as a more powerful node.[¶](#section-4.5-4){.pilcrow}

ICN routing may comprise three steps: name resolution, content request
routing, and content delivery. This document investigates the name
resolution step, which is the first and most important to be achieved
for ICN routing to be successful. A Name Resolution Service (NRS) in ICN
is defined as the service that provides such a function of name
resolution for translating an object name into some other information
such as a locator, another name, metadata, next-hop info, etc. that is
used for forwarding the object request.[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

This document classifies and analyzes the NRS approaches according to
whether the name resolution step is separated from the content request
routing as an explicit process or not. This document also explains the
NRS functions used to support heterogeneous name types, producer
mobility, scalable routing system, off-path caching, nameless object,
