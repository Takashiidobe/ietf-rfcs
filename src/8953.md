::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

The Coordinating Attack Response at Internet Scale (CARIS) 2 workshop,
sponsored by the Internet Society, took place on 28 February and 1 March
2019 in Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA. Participants spanned regional,
national, international, and enterprise Computer Security Incident
Response Teams (CSIRTs), operators, service providers, network and
security operators, transport operators and researchers, incident
response researchers, vendors, and participants from standards
communities. This workshop continued the work started at the first CARIS
workshop, with a focus on scaling incident prevention and detection as
the Internet industry moves to a stronger and a more ubiquitous
deployment of session encryption.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

The Coordinating Attack Response at Internet Scale (CARIS) 2 workshop
\[[CARISEvent](#CARISEvent){.xref}\], sponsored by the Internet Society,
took place on 28 February and 1 March 2019 in Cambridge, Massachusetts,
USA. Participants spanned regional, national, international, and
enterprise Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs),
operators, service providers, network and security operators, transport
operators and researchers, incident response researchers, vendors, and
participants from standards communities. This workshop continued the
work started at the first CARIS workshop \[[RFC8073](#RFC8073){.xref}\],
with a focus on scaling incident prevention and detection as the
Internet industry moves to a stronger and a more ubiquitous deployment
of session encryption. Considering the related initiative to form a
research group (Stopping Malware and Researching Threats
\[[SMART](#SMART){.xref}\]) in the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF),
the focus on prevention included consideration of research opportunities
to improve protocols and determine if there are ways to improve attack
detection during the protocol design phase that could later influence
protocol development in the IETF. This is one way to think about scaling
response, through prevention and allowing for new methods to evolve for
detection in a post-encrypted world. Although the proposed SMART
Research Group has not yet progressed, the work to better scale incident
response continues through the projects proposed at CARIS2 as well as in
future CARIS workshops.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

The goal of each CARIS workshop has been to focus on the challenge of
improving the overall security posture. The approach has been to
identify intrinsic or built-in protection capabilities for improved
defense, automation, and scaling attack response through collaboration
and improved architectural patterns. It has been assumed that additional
training will likely not address the lack of information security
professionals to fill the job gap. Currently, there is approximately a
[three-million-person deficit](#deficit){.xref}
\[[deficit](#deficit){.xref}\] for security professionals worldwide, and
that is only expected to grow. In preparing for the workshop, the chair
and program committee considered that this gap cannot be filled through
training but requires measures to reduce the number of information
security professionals needed through new architectures and research
toward attack prevention. CARIS2 was specifically focused on the
industry shift toward the increased use of stronger session encryption
([TLS 1.3](#RFC8446){.xref} \[[RFC8446](#RFC8446){.xref}\],
[QUIC](#I-D.ietf-quic-transport){.xref}
\[[QUIC](#I-D.ietf-quic-transport){.xref}\], [tcpcrypt](#RFC8548){.xref}
\[[RFC8548](#RFC8548){.xref}\], etc.) and how prevention and detection
can advance in this new paradigm. As such, the goals for this workshop
included:[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

Both CARIS workshops brought together a set of individuals who had not
previously collaborated toward the goals of scaling attack response.
This is important as the participants span various areas of Internet
technology work, conduct research, provide a global perspective, have
access to varying data sets and infrastructure, and are influential in
their area of expertise. The specific goals, contributions, and
participants of the CARIS2 workshop were all considered in the design of
the breakout sessions to both identify and advance research through
collaboration. The breakout sessions varied in format to keep attendees
engaged and collaborating; some involved the full set of attendees while
others utilized groups.[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

The workshop focused on identifying potential areas for collaboration
and advancing research.[¶](#section-4-2){.pilcrow}

This breakout session considered points raised in the preceding talks on
hurdles for automating security controls, detection, and response; the
teams presenting noted several challenges they still face today. The
breakout session worked toward identifying standard protocols and data
formats that succeeded in achieving adoption as well as several that
failed or only achieved limited adoption. The results from the
evaluation were interesting and could aid in achieving greater adoption
when new work areas are developed. The following subsections detail the
results.[¶](#section-4.1-1){.pilcrow}

#### [4.1.1.](#section-4.1.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Wide Adoption](#name-wide-adoption){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-wide-adoption}

The Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol has replaced the Secure
Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol.[¶](#section-4.1.1-1){.pilcrow}

Observations: There was a clear need for session encryption at the
transport layer to protect application data. E-commerce was a driving
force at the time with a downside to those who did not adopt. Other
positive attributes that aided adoption were modular design, clean
interfaces, and being first to market.[¶](#section-4.1.1-2){.pilcrow}

The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) enables configuration
management of devices with extension points for private configuration
and management settings. SNMP is widely adopted and is only now, after
decades, being replaced by a newer alternative, YANG (a data modeling
language) that facilitates configuration management via the Network
Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) or RESTCONF. SNMP facilitated an answer
to a needed problem set: configuration, telemetry, and network
management. Its development considered the connection between the user,
vendor, and developers. Challenges did surface for adoption from
SNMPv1.1 to 1.2, as there was no compelling reason for adoption. SNMPv3
gained adoption due to its resilience to attacks by providing protection
through improved authentication and
encryption.[¶](#section-4.1.1-3){.pilcrow}

IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) was identified as achieving wide
adoption for several reasons. The low cost of entry, wide vendor
support, diverse user base, and wide set of use cases spanning multiple
technology areas were some of the key drivers
cited.[¶](#section-4.1.1-4){.pilcrow}

X.509 was explored for its success in gaining adoption. The solution
being abstract from crypto, open, customizable, and extensible were some
of the reasons cited for its successful adoption. The team deemed it a
good solution to a good problem and observed that government adoption
aided its success.[¶](#section-4.1.1-5){.pilcrow}

#### [4.1.2.](#section-4.1.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Limited Adoption](#name-limited-adoption){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-limited-adoption}

Next, each team evaluated solutions that have not enjoyed wide
adoption.[¶](#section-4.1.2-1){.pilcrow}

Although Structured Threat Information eXpression (STIX) and the
Incident Object Description Exchange Format (IODEF) are somewhat similar
in their goals, the standards were selected for evaluation by two
separate groups with some common
findings.[¶](#section-4.1.2-2){.pilcrow}

STIX has had limited adoption by the financial sector but no single,
definitive end user. The standard is still in development with the US
government as the primary developer in partnership with OASIS. There is
interest in using STIX to manage content, but users don\'t really care
about what technology is used for the exchange. The initial goals may
not wind up matching the end result for STIX, as managing content may be
the primary use case.[¶](#section-4.1.2-3){.pilcrow}

IODEF was specified by National Research and Education Networks (NRENs)
and Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) and formalized in
the IETF \[[RFC7970](#RFC7970){.xref}\]. The user is the security
operations center (SOC). While there are several implementations, it is
not widely adopted. In terms of exchange, users are more interested in
indicators than full event information, and this applies to STIX as
well. Sharing and trust are additional hurdles as many are not willing
to disclose information.[¶](#section-4.1.2-4){.pilcrow}

DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) has DNSSEC as a
dependency, which is a hurdle toward adoption (too many dependencies).
It has a roll-your-own adoption model, which is risky. While there are
some large pockets of adoption, there is still much work to do to gain
widespread adoption. A regulatory requirement gave rise to partial
adoption in Germany, which naturally resulted in production of
documentation written in German \-- possibly giving rise to further
adoption in German-speaking countries. There has also been progress made
in the Netherlands through the creation of a website:
\<[internet.nl](internet.nl)\>. The website allows you to test your
website for a number of standards (IPv6, DNSSEC, DANE, etc.).
\<[internet.nl](internet.nl)\> is a collaboration of industry
organizations, companies, and the government in the Netherlands and is
available for worldwide use.[¶](#section-4.1.2-5){.pilcrow}

IP version 6 (IPv6) has struggled, and the expense of running a dual
stack was one of the highest concerns on the list discussed in the
workshop breakout. The end user for IPv6 is everyone, and the breakout
team considered it too ambiguous. Too many new requirements have been
added over its 20-year life. The scope of necessary adoption is large
with many peripheral devices. Government requirements for support have
helped somewhat with improved interoperability and adoption, but
features like NAT being added to IPv4 slowed adoption. With no new
features being added to IPv4 and lessons learned, there\'s still a
possibility for success.[¶](#section-4.1.2-6){.pilcrow}

This breakout session followed the sessions on MUD, Protocol for
Automated Vulnerability Assessment (PAVA), and Protocol for Automatic
Security Configuration (PASC), which have themes of automation at scale.
MUD was designed for Internet of Things (IoT), and as such, scaling was
a major consideration. The PAVA and PASC work builds off of MUD and
maintains some of the same themes. This breakout session was focused on
groups brainstorming preventative measures and enabling vendors to
deploy mitigations.[¶](#section-4.2-1){.pilcrow}

One group dove a bit deeper into MUD and layer 2 (L2) discovery. MUD
changes sets of filtering control management to the vendor or
intermediary MUD vendors for a predictable platform that scales well.
While the overall value of MUD is clear, the use of MUD and what traffic
is expected for a particular device should be considered sensitive
information, as it could be used to exploit a device. MUD has an option
of using L2 discovery to share MUD files. L2 discovery, like the Dynamic
Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), is not encrypted from the local
client to the DHCP server at this point in time (there is some interest
to correct this, but it hasn\'t received enough support yet). As a
result, it is possible to leak information and reveal data about the
devices for which the MUD files would be applied. This could multicast
out information such as network characteristics, firmware versions,
manufacturers, etc. There was some discussion on the use of 802.11 to
improve connections \[[IEEE802.11](#IEEE802.11){.xref}\]. Several
participants from this group plan to research this further and identify
options to prevent information leakage while achieving the stated goals
of MUD.[¶](#section-4.2-2){.pilcrow}

The next group discussed a proposal one of the participants had already
begun developing, namely privacy for rendezvous service. The basic idea
was to encrypt Server Name Indication (SNI) using DNS to obtain public
keys. The suffix on server IPv6 would be unique to a TLS session
(information missing). The discussion on this proposal was fruitful, as
the full set of attendees engaged, with special interest from the
incident responders to be involved in early review cycles. Incident
responders are very interested to understand how protocols will change
and to assess the overall impact of changes on privacy and security
operations. Even if there are no changes to the protocol proposals
stemming from this review, the group discussion landed on this being a
valuable exchange to understand early the impacts of changes for
incident detection and mitigation, to devise new strategies, and to
provide assessments on the impact of protocol changes on security in the
round.[¶](#section-4.2-3){.pilcrow}

The third group reported back on trust exchanges relying heavily on
relationships between individuals. They were concerned with scaling the
trust model and finding ways to do that better. The group dove deeper
into this topic.[¶](#section-4.2-4){.pilcrow}

The fourth group discussed useful data for incident responders. This
built on the first breakout session ([Section 4.1](#breakout_1){.xref}).
The group determined that indicators of compromise (IoCs) are what most
organizations and groups are able to successfully exchange. Ideally,
these would be fixed and programmable. They discussed developing a
richer format for sharing event threats. When reporting back to the
group, a successful solution used in the EU was mentioned: the [Malware
Information Sharing Platform (MISP)](#MISP){.xref}
\[[MISP](#MISP){.xref}\]. This will be considered in the review of
existing efforts to determine if anything new is
needed.[¶](#section-4.2-5){.pilcrow}

The fourth breakout session followed [Dave Plonka]{.contact-name}\'s
talk on IPv6 aggregation to provide privacy for IPv6 sessions.
Essentially, IPv6 provides additional capabilities for monitoring
sessions end to end. Dave and his coauthor, [Arthur
Berger]{.contact-name}, primarily focus on measurement research but
found a way to aggregate sessions to assist with maintaining user
privacy. If you can devise methods to perform management and
measurement, or even perform security functions, while accommodating
methods to protect privacy, a stronger result is likely. This also
precludes the need for additional privacy improvement work to defeat
measurement objectives.[¶](#section-4.4-1){.pilcrow}

This breakout session was focused on devising methods to perform
monitoring and measurement, coupled with advancing privacy
considerations. The full group listed out options for protocols to
explore and ranked them, with the four highest then explored by the
breakout groups. Groups agreed to work further on the proposed
ideas.[¶](#section-4.4-2){.pilcrow}

#### [4.4.1.](#section-4.4.1){.section-number .selfRef} [IP Address Reputation](#name-ip-address-reputation){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-ip-address-reputation}

There is a need to understand address assignment and configuration for
hosts and services, especially with IPv6
\[[PlonkaBergerCARIS2](#PlonkaBergerCARIS2){.xref}\] in (1) sharing
IP-address-related information to inform attack response efforts while
still protecting the privacy of victims and possible attackers and (2)
mitigating abuse by altering the treatment, e.g., dropping or
rate-limiting, of packets. Currently, there is no database that analysts
and researchers can consult to, for instance, determine the lifetimes of
IPv6 addresses or the prefix length at which the address is expected to
be stable over time. The researchers propose either introducing a new
database (compare PeeringDB) or extending existing databases (e.g., the
regional Internet registries (RIRs)) to contain such information and
allowing arbitrary queries. The prefix information would either be
provided by networks that are willing or based on measurement algorithms
that reverse-engineer reasonable values based on Internet measurements
\[[PlonkaBergerKIP](#PlonkaBergerKIP){.xref}\]. In the former case, the
incentive of networks to provide such information is to ensure that
privacy of their users is respected and to limit collateral damage
caused by access control lists affecting more of that network\'s
addresses than necessary, e.g., in the face of abuse. This is an early
idea; [Dave Plonka]{.contact-name} is the lead contact for those

SNARC is a mechanism to assign value to trust indicators, used to make
decisions about good or bad actors. The mechanism would be able to
distinguish between client and server connections and would be human
readable. In addition, it builds on zero trust networking and avoids
consolidation, thus supporting legitimate new players. SNARC has a
similar theme to the IP reputation/BGP ranking idea mentioned above.
SNARC is not currently defined by an RFC; however, such an RFC would
help customers and design teams on existing solutions. The group plans
to research visual aspects and underlying principles as they begin work
on this idea. They plan to begin work in several stages, researching
\"trust\" indicators, \"trust\" value calculations, and research actions
to apply to \"trust\". The overarching goal is to address blind trust,
one of the challenges identified with information/incident exchanges.

logs, covering an agreed set of conditions. Using a log-injecting
compiler would increase logging for those applications and improve the
uniformity of logged activity. Increasing logging capabilities at the

Fingerprinting has been used for numerous applications on the Web,
including security, and will become of increasing importance with the
deployment of stronger encryption. Fingerprinting provides a method to
identify traffic without using decryption. The group discussed privacy
considerations and balancing how you achieve the security benefits
(identifying malicious traffic, information leakage, threat indicators,
etc.). They are interested in deriving methods to validate the
authenticity without identifying the source of traffic. They are also
concerned with scaling issues. [William Weinstein]{.contact-name} is the

### [4.5.](#section-4.5){.section-number .selfRef} [Taxonomy and Gaps Session](#name-taxonomy-and-gaps-session){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-taxonomy-and-gaps-session}

At the start of the second day of the workshop, [Kirsty
Paine]{.contact-name} and [Mirjam Kühne]{.contact-name} prepared (and
Kirsty led) a workshop-style session to discuss taxonomies used in
incident response, attacks, and threat detection, comparing solutions
and identifying gaps. The primary objective was to determine a path
forward by selecting the language to be used in the proposed SMART
Research Group. Several taxonomies were presented for review and
discussion. The topic remains open, but the following key points were
highlighted by participants:[¶](#section-4.5-1){.pilcrow}

-   [A single taxonomy might not be the way to go, because which
    taxonomy you use depends on what problem you are trying to solve,
    e.g., attribution of the attack, mitigation steps, technical
    features, or organizational impact
    measurements.[¶](#section-4.5-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.5-2.1}
-   [A tool to map between taxonomies should be automated, as there are
    requirements within groups or nations to use specific
    taxonomies.[¶](#section-4.5-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.5-2.2}
-   [The level of detail needed for reporting to management and for the
    analyst investigating the incident can be very different. At the
    workshop, one attendee mentioned that, for management reporting,
    they only use 8 categories to lighten the load on analysts, whereas
    some of the taxonomies contain 52
    categories.[¶](#section-4.5-2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.5-2.3}
-   [How you plan to use the taxonomy matters and may vary between use
    cases. Take, for instance, sharing data with external entities
    versus internal only. The taxonomy selected depends on what you plan
    to do with it. Some stated a need for attribute-based dynamic
    anthologies as opposed to rigid taxonomies used by others. A rigid
    taxonomy did not work for many from feedback in the
    session.[¶](#section-4.5-2.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.5-2.4}
-   [\[[RFC4949](#RFC4949){.xref}\] was briefly discussed as a
    possibility; however, there is a clear need to update terminology in
    this publication around this space in particular. This is likely to
    be raised in the Security Area Advisory Group (SAAG) during the open
    mic session, hopefully with proposed new definitions to demonstrate
    the issue and evolution of terms over
    time.[¶](#section-4.5-2.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.5-2.5}
-   [Within a taxonomy, prioritization matters to understand the impact
    of threats or an attack. How do you map that between differing
    taxonomies? What is the problem to be solved, and what tooling is
    required?[¶](#section-4.5-2.6){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.5-2.6}
-   [Attack attribution had varying degrees of interest. Some felt the
    public sector cared more about attribution, not about individuals.
    They were interested in possible motivations behind an attack and
    determining if there were other likely victims based on these
    motivations. Understanding if the source was an individual actor,
    organized crime, or a nation state
    mattered.[¶](#section-4.5-2.7){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.5-2.7}

The result of this discussion was not to narrow down to one taxonomy but
to think about mappings between taxonomies and the use cases for
exchanging or sharing information, eventually giving rise to a common
method to discuss threats and attacks. Researchers need a common
vocabulary, not necessarily a common
taxonomy.[¶](#section-4.5-3){.pilcrow}
