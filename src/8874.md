## [1.](#section-1){.section-number .selfRef} [Introduction](#name-introduction){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-introduction}

The IETF has an open and transparent process for developing standards.
The use of [GitHub](https://github.com/) or similar tools, when used as
part of this process, can have several objectives. GitHub provides tools
that can be helpful in editing documents. Use of this service has been
found to reduce the time that a working group needs to produce documents
and to improve the quality of the final
result.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

The use of version control improves the traceability and visibility of
changes. Issue tracking can be used to manage open issues and provide a
record of their resolution. Pull requests allow for better engagement on
technical and editorial changes, and encourage contributions from a
larger set of contributors. Using GitHub can also broaden the community
of contributors for a specification.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

The main purpose of this document is to provide guidelines for how a
working group might integrate the capabilities provided by GitHub into
their processes for developing Internet-Drafts. Whether to use GitHub
and whether to adopt these practices is left to the discretion of the
working group.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

This document is meant as a supplement to existing working group
practices. It provides guidance to working group chairs and participants
on how they can best use GitHub within the framework established by RFC
2418 \[[RFC2418](#RFC2418){.xref}\]. This document aims to establish
norms that reduce the variation in usage patterns between different
working groups and to help avoid issues that have been encountered in
the past.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

A companion document, \[[RFC8875](#RFC8875){.xref}\], describes
administrative processes that support the practices described in this
document.[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}

Although the operation of IRTF research groups can be similar in
function to working groups, this document only directly addresses the
needs of working groups. However, other groups may draw inspiration for
GitHub use from the contents herein.[¶](#section-1-6){.pilcrow}

### [1.1.](#section-1.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Distributed Version Control Systems](#name-distributed-version-control){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-distributed-version-control}

Version control systems are a critical component of software engineering
and are also quite useful for document
editing.[¶](#section-1.1-1){.pilcrow}

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a distributed version control system that
can operate without a central service. Each instance of a repository
contains a number of revisions. Each revision stores the complete state
of a set of files. Users are able to create new revisions in their copy
of a repository and share revisions between copies of
repositories.[¶](#section-1.1-2){.pilcrow}

::: {#github}
::: {#section-1.2 .section}
### [1.2.](#section-1.2){.section-number .selfRef} [GitHub](#name-github){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-github}

GitHub is a service operated at \<<https://github.com/>\>. GitHub
provides centralized storage for Git repositories. GitHub is freely
accessible on the open Internet.[¶](#section-1.2-1){.pilcrow}

GitHub provides a simplified and integrated interface to Git and also
provides basic user management, an issue tracker, associated wikis,
project hosting, and other features.[¶](#section-1.2-2){.pilcrow}

There are a large number of projects at GitHub and a very large
community of contributors. One way in which some IETF working groups
have benefited from use of the service is through increased numbers of
reviews of the document and associated issues, along with other
improvements that come from facilitating participation by a broader
community.[¶](#section-1.2-3){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-1.3 .section}
### [1.3.](#section-1.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Other Services](#name-other-services){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-other-services}

Git is not the only version control system available, nor is GitHub the
only possible choice for hosting. There are other services that host
revision control repositories and provide similar additional features as
GitHub. For instance, [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/) and
[GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) provide similar feature sets. In
addition to a hosted service, software for custom installations
exists.[¶](#section-1.3-1){.pilcrow}

This document concentrates primarily on GitHub as it has a large and
active community of contributors. As a result, some content might not be
applicable to other similar services. A working group that decides to
adopt an alternative tool or service can still benefit from the general
guidance in this document.[¶](#section-1.3-2){.pilcrow}

### [1.4.](#section-1.4){.section-number .selfRef} [Document Goals](#name-document-goals){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-document-goals}

This document aims to describe how a working group might best apply
GitHub to their work. The intent is to allow each working group
considerable flexibility in how they use
GitHub.[¶](#section-1.4-1){.pilcrow}

This document requires that policies for use of GitHub are agreed upon
and clearly communicated within the working group (see [Section
2](#policy){.xref}). The remainder of the document contains guidelines
and advice on how to construct a workable
policy.[¶](#section-1.4-2){.pilcrow}

The requirements here apply to the case where a working group decides to
use GitHub as a primary means of interaction. Individuals can set their
own policies when using GitHub for managing their own drafts or for
managing drafts that they edit on behalf of a working group that has not
explicitly adopted GitHub.[¶](#section-1.4-3){.pilcrow}

For both sets of users, this document aims to provide some amount of
advice on practices that have been
effective.[¶](#section-1.4-4){.pilcrow}

This document only aims to address use of GitHub in developing
documents. A working group could choose to use the tool to aid in
managing their charter or session materials such as agendas, minutes,
and presentations. Though the advice here might apply more broadly,
using GitHub to manage other material is out of scope for this
document.[¶](#section-1.4-5){.pilcrow}

### [2.1.](#section-2.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Organizations](#name-organizations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-organizations}

Organizations are a way of forming groups of contributors on GitHub. The
working group [SHOULD]{.bcp14} create a new organization for its work. A
working group organization [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be named consistently so
that it can be found. For instance, the name could be ietf-wg-\<wgname>,
as recommended in
\[[RFC8875](#RFC8875){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2.1-1){.pilcrow}

A single organization [SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} be used for all IETF activity
or all activity within an area. Large organizations create too much
overhead for general management tasks.[¶](#section-2.1-2){.pilcrow}

GitHub requires that each organization have at least one owner. The
owners for a working group repository [MUST]{.bcp14} include responsible
area directors and the IETF Secretariat. Working group chairs
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} also be included as owners. Area directors
[MAY]{.bcp14} also designate a delegate that becomes an owner, such as
another area director from the same area. An organization [MUST]{.bcp14}
have at least two owners.[¶](#section-2.1-3){.pilcrow}

Within an organization, members can be grouped into teams. A team with
\"Admin\" access to repositories [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be created for the
working group chairs and any working group
secretary.[¶](#section-2.1-4){.pilcrow}

Details about creating organizations adhering to these guidelines can be
found in \[[RFC8875](#RFC8875){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2.1-5){.pilcrow}

### [2.2.](#section-2.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Communicating Policies](#name-communicating-policies){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-communicating-policies}

Each working group [MAY]{.bcp14} set its own policy as to whether and
how it uses GitHub. It is important that occasional participants in the
working group and others accustomed to IETF tools be able to determine
this and easily find the policy and GitHub
organization.[¶](#section-2.2-1){.pilcrow}

A simple example of how to do this is to include a link to the GitHub
organization on the working group charter page in the datatracker.
Similarly, if there are additional resources, such as mailing lists,
links to those resources could also be
added.[¶](#section-2.2-2){.pilcrow}

Repositories [MUST]{.bcp14} include a copy of or reference to the policy
that applies to managing any documents they contain. Updating the README
or CONTRIBUTING file in the repository with details of the process
ensures that the process is recorded in a stable location other than the
mailing list archive. This also makes working group policies available
to casual contributors who might only interact with the GitHub
repository.[¶](#section-2.2-3){.pilcrow}

GitHub prominently links to the CONTRIBUTING file on certain pages. This
file [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be used in preference to the README for
information that new contributors need. The README [SHOULD]{.bcp14}
contain a link to the CONTRIBUTING file.[¶](#section-2.2-4){.pilcrow}

In addition to working group policies, notices on repositories
[MUST]{.bcp14} include citations for the [IETF Note
Well](https://www.ietf.org/about/note-well/).[¶](#section-2.2-5){.pilcrow}

Working group chairs are responsible for determining how to best
accomplish the charter objectives in an open and transparent fashion.
The working group chairs are responsible for determining if there is
interest in using GitHub and for making a consensus call about whether
the proposed policy and use is acceptable.[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

Chairs [SHOULD]{.bcp14} involve area directors in any decision to use
GitHub, especially where substantive discussion of issues is permitted
as described in [Section
5.3](#mode-discuss){.xref}.[¶](#section-3-2){.pilcrow}

### [3.1.](#section-3.1){.section-number .selfRef} [What to Use GitHub For](#name-what-to-use-github-for){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-what-to-use-github-for}

Working group chairs decide what GitHub features the working group will
rely upon. [Section 4](#features){.xref} contains a more thorough
discussion on the different features that can be
used.[¶](#section-3.1-1){.pilcrow}

Working group chairs who decide to use GitHub [MUST]{.bcp14} inform the
working group of their decision on the working group mailing list. An
email detailing how the working group intends to use GitHub is
sufficient, though it might be helpful to occasionally remind new
contributors of these guidelines.[¶](#section-3.1-2){.pilcrow}

Working group chairs are responsible for ensuring that any policy they
adopt is enforced and maintained.[¶](#section-3.1-3){.pilcrow}

The set of GitHub features ([Section 4](#features){.xref}) that the
working group relies upon need to be clearly documented in policies.
This document provides some guidance on potential policies and how those
might be applied.[¶](#section-3.1-4){.pilcrow}

Features that the working group does not rely upon can be made available
to document editors. Editors are then able to use these features for
their own purposes. For example, though the working group might not
formally use issues to track items that require further discussion in
order to reach consensus, keeping the issue tracker available to editors
can be valuable.[¶](#section-3.1-5){.pilcrow}

Working group policies need to be set with the goal of improving
transparency, participation, and ultimately the quality of documents. At
times, it might be appropriate to impose some limitations on what
document editors are able to do in order to serve these goals. Chairs
are encouraged to periodically consult with document editors to ensure
that policies are effective.[¶](#section-3.1-6){.pilcrow}

A document editor can still use GitHub independently for documents that
they edit, even if the working group does not expressly choose to use
GitHub. Any such public repository [MUST]{.bcp14} follow the IETF Note
Well and bear notices; see [Section 2.2](#notices){.xref}. This
recognizes that editors have traditionally chosen their own methods for
managing the documents they edit but preserves the need for contributors
to understand their obligations with respect to IETF
processes.[¶](#section-3.1-7){.pilcrow}

Work done in GitHub has no special status. The output of any activity
using GitHub needs to be taken to the working group and is subject to
approval, rejection, or modification by the working group as with any
other input.[¶](#section-3.1-8){.pilcrow}

::: {#repositories}
::: {#section-3.2 .section}
### [3.2.](#section-3.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Repositories](#name-repositories){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-repositories}

New repositories can be created within the working group organization at
the discretion of the chairs. Chairs could decide to only create new
repositories for adopted working group items, or they might create
repositories for individual documents on
request.[¶](#section-3.2-1){.pilcrow}

Maintaining private repositories for working group products is not
recommended without specific cause. For instance, a document that
details a security vulnerability might be kept private prior to its
initial publication as an Internet-Draft. Once an Internet-Draft is
published, repositories for working group documents [MUST]{.bcp14} be
made public.[¶](#section-3.2-2){.pilcrow}

The adoption status of any document [MUST]{.bcp14} be clear from the
contents of the repository. This can be achieved by having the name of
the document reflect status (that is, draft-ietf-\<wgname>-\...
indicates that the document was adopted) or through a prominent notice
(such as in the README).[¶](#section-3.2-3){.pilcrow}

Experience has shown that maintaining separate repositories for
independent documents is most manageable. This allows the work in that
repository to be focused on a single item.[¶](#section-3.2-4){.pilcrow}

Closely related documents, such as those that together address a single
milestone, might be placed in a single repository. This allows editors
to more easily manage changes and issues that affect multiple
documents.[¶](#section-3.2-5){.pilcrow}

Maintaining multiple documents in the same repository can add overhead
that negatively affects individual documents. For instance, issues might
require additional markings to identify the document that they affect.
Also, because editors all have write access to the repository, managing
the set of people with write access to a larger repository is more
difficult ([Section 3.3](#editors){.xref}).[¶](#section-3.2-6){.pilcrow}

### [3.3.](#section-3.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Editors and Contributors](#name-editors-and-contributors){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-editors-and-contributors}

Working group chairs [MUST]{.bcp14} give document editors write access
to document repositories. This can be done by creating teams with write
access and allocating editors to those teams or by making editors
collaborators on the repository.[¶](#section-3.3-1){.pilcrow}

Working group chairs [MAY]{.bcp14} also grant other individuals write
access for other reasons such as maintaining supporting code or build
configurations. Working group chairs, as administrators or owners of the
organization, might also have write access to repositories. Users other
than document editors, including chairs, [SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} make
changes to working group documents without prior coordination with
document editors.[¶](#section-3.3-2){.pilcrow}

A working group [MAY]{.bcp14} create a team for regular contributors
that is only given read access to a repository. This does not confer
additional privileges on these contributors; it instead allows for
issues and pull requests to be assigned to those people. This can be
used to manage the assignment of editorial or review tasks to
individuals outside of the editor team.[¶](#section-3.3-3){.pilcrow}

In addition to the canonical XML format \[[RFC7991](#RFC7991){.xref}\],
document editors might choose to use a different input form for editing
documents, such as Markdown. Markdown-based formats are more accessible
for new contributors, though ultimately, decisions about format are left
to document editors.[¶](#section-3.4-1){.pilcrow}

Formats that are not text-based [SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} be used, as these
are ill-disposed to the sorts of interaction that revision control
enables.[¶](#section-3.4-2){.pilcrow}

Contributions to documents come in many forms. GitHub provides a range
of options in addition to email. Input on GitHub can take the form of
new issues and pull requests, comments on issues and pull requests, and
comments on commits.[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-4.1 .section}
### [4.1.](#section-4.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Issue Tracker](#name-issue-tracker){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-issue-tracker}

The GitHub issue tracker can be an effective way of managing the set of
open issues on a document. Issues, both open and closed, can be a useful
way of recording decisions made by a working
group.[¶](#section-4.1-1){.pilcrow}

Issues can be given arbitrary labels, assigned to contributors, and
assembled into milestones. The issue tracker is integrated into the
repository; an issue can be closed using a special marker in a commit
message.[¶](#section-4.1-2){.pilcrow}

When deciding to use GitHub, working group chairs [MUST]{.bcp14} decide
how the GitHub issue tracker is used. Use of the issue tracker could be
limited to recording the existence of issues, or it might be used as the
venue for substantial technical discussion between
contributors.[¶](#section-4.1-3){.pilcrow}

A working group policy [MAY]{.bcp14} require that all substantive
changes be tracked using issues. Suggested policies for the use of the
GitHub issue tracker are the primary subject of [Section
5](#modes){.xref}.[¶](#section-4.1-4){.pilcrow}

::: {#issue-labels}
::: {#section-4.1.1 .section}
#### [4.1.1.](#section-4.1.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Issue Labels](#name-issue-labels){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-issue-labels}

A system of labeling issues can be effective in managing issues. For
instance, marking substantive issues separately from editorial can be
helpful at guiding discussion. Using labels can also be helpful in
identifying issues for which consensus has been achieved but that
require editors to integrate the changes into a
document.[¶](#section-4.1.1-1){.pilcrow}

Labels can be used to identify particular categories of issues or to
mark specific issues for discussion at an upcoming
session.[¶](#section-4.1.1-2){.pilcrow}

Chairs communicate any process that specifically relates to the use of
labels to the working group. This includes the semantics of labels, and
who can apply and remove these labels. [Section 5.4](#labels){.xref}
describes some basic strategies that might be adopted to manage
decision-making processes.[¶](#section-4.1.1-3){.pilcrow}

Editors have write access to repositories, which also allows them to
close issues. The user that opens an issue is also able to close the
issue. Chairs [MUST]{.bcp14} provide guidance on who is permitted to
close an issue and under what conditions.[¶](#section-4.1.2-1){.pilcrow}

Restrictions on who can close an issue and under what circumstances are
generally not advisable until a document has reached a certain degree of
maturity.[¶](#section-4.1.2-2){.pilcrow}

Issues that have reached a resolution that has working group consensus
[MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be reopened unless new information is
presented.[¶](#section-4.1.3-1){.pilcrow}

For long-running work items, new contributors often raise issues that
have already been resolved. Moreover, there could be temptation to
reopen contentious issues resolved with rough consensus. Determining
whether arguments presented in favor of reopening an issue represents
new information might require some discussion in the working
group.[¶](#section-4.1.3-2){.pilcrow}

Chairs are empowered to exercise discretion in determining whether or
not to reopen issues. For more difficult matters, the chairs
[MAY]{.bcp14} insist that the working group reach consensus on whether
an issue should be reopened. Note, however, that any product of this
process still needs to have the support of rough consensus in the
working group, which could justify reopening
issues.[¶](#section-4.1.3-3){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-4.2 .section}
### [4.2.](#section-4.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Pull Requests](#name-pull-requests){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-pull-requests}

A pull request is a GitHub feature that allows a user to request a
change to a repository. A user does not need to have write access to a
repository to create a pull request. A user can create a \"fork\", or
copy, of any public repository. The user has write access to their own
fork, allowing them to make local changes. A pull request asks the owner
of a repository to merge a specific set of changes from a fork (or any
branch) into their copy.[¶](#section-4.2-1){.pilcrow}

Editors are encouraged to make pull requests for all substantial changes
rather than committing directly to the \"primary\" branch of the
repository. See [Section 5.3.2](#mature-documents){.xref} for discussion
on what constitutes a substantial change. A pull request creates an
artifact that records the reasons for changes and provides other
contributors with an opportunity to review the change. Ideally, pull
requests that address substantive issues mention the issue they address
in the opening comment. A working group policy could require that pull
requests be used in this fashion.[¶](#section-4.2-2){.pilcrow}

Note: This document assumes that there is a unified effort on a
document, all concentrated on a single Git branch. More advanced usage
of Git is not in the scope of this
document.[¶](#section-4.2-3.1){.pilcrow}

Pull requests have many of the same properties as issues, including the
ability to host discussion and bear labels. Critically, using pull
requests creates a record of actions taken.[¶](#section-4.2-4){.pilcrow}

For significant changes, leaving a pull request open until discussion of
the issue within the working group concludes allows the pull request to
track the discussion and properly capture the outcome of discussions.
Pull requests can be updated as discussions continue, or in response to
feedback.[¶](#section-4.2-5){.pilcrow}

Groups of editors could adopt a practice of having one editor create a
pull request and another merge it. This ensures that changes are
reviewed by editors. Editors are given discretion in how they manage
changes amongst themselves.[¶](#section-4.2-6){.pilcrow}

::: {#discussion-on-pull-requests}

#### [4.2.1.](#section-4.2.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Discussion on Pull Requests](#name-discussion-on-pull-requests){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-discussion-on-pull-requests}

In addition to the features that pull requests share with issues, users
can also review the changes in a pull request. This is a valuable
feature, but it presents some challenges.[¶](#section-4.2.1-1){.pilcrow}

Comments in a review other than a summary are attached to specific lines
of the proposed change. Such comments can be hard or impossible to find
if changes are subsequently made to the pull request. This is
problematic for contributors who do not track discussions
closely.[¶](#section-4.2.1-2){.pilcrow}

For this reason, working group chairs [SHOULD]{.bcp14} discourage the
use of inline comments for substantial technical discussion of
issues.[¶](#section-4.2.1-3){.pilcrow}

#### [4.2.2.](#section-4.2.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Merging Pull Requests](#name-merging-pull-requests){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-merging-pull-requests}

A working group [MUST]{.bcp14} determine who is permitted to merge pull
requests. Document editors [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be permitted to merge pull
requests at their discretion. This requires that editors exercise some
judgment. Working group chairs [MAY]{.bcp14} occasionally identify a
pull request and request that editors withhold merging until working
group consensus has been assessed.[¶](#section-4.2.2-1){.pilcrow}

Note that the copy of a document that is maintained on GitHub does not
need to be a perfect reflection of working group consensus at every
point in time. Document editors need some flexibility in how they manage
a document.[¶](#section-4.2.2-2){.pilcrow}

### [4.3.](#section-4.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Monitoring Activity](#name-monitoring-activity){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-monitoring-activity}

GitHub produces individualized email notifications of activity that each
user can adjust to their preferences. In addition to these, some working
groups have created read-only mailing lists that receive notifications
about activity on working group repositories. The volume of information
on these lists can be too high to monitor actively, but access to an
archive of actions can be useful.[¶](#section-4.3-1){.pilcrow}

An alternative is to rely on periodic email summaries of activity, such
as those produced by a notification tool like
[github-notify-ml](https://github.com/dontcallmedom/github-notify-ml).
This tool has been used effectively in several working groups, though it
requires server infrastructure.[¶](#section-4.3-2){.pilcrow}

Additionally, clear reporting about the changes that were included in
each revision of an Internet-Draft helps ensure that contributors can
follow activity. This might be achieved by requesting that editors
provide a change log that captures substantive changes to the document
in each revision.[¶](#section-4.3-3){.pilcrow}

## [5.](#section-5){.section-number .selfRef} [Typical Working Group Policies](#name-typical-working-group-polic){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-typical-working-group-polic}

Current experience with use of GitHub suggests a few different
approaches to greater use of the tool in working
groups.[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

This section describes some basic modes for interacting with GitHub,
each progressively more involved. This starts with a very lightweight
interaction where document management is the only feature that is
formally used; then, progressively more intensive use of the GitHub
issue tracking capabilities is described. These approaches differ
primarily in how discussion of substantive matters is managed. Most of
the advice in this document applies equally to all
models.[¶](#section-5-2){.pilcrow}

Working groups can adjust these policies to suit their needs but are
advised to avoid gratuitous changes for the sake of consistency across
the IETF as a whole. It is possible to use different processes for
different documents in the working group.[¶](#section-5-3){.pilcrow}

Working group chairs are responsible for confirming that the working
group has consensus to adopt any process. In particular, the
introduction of a more tightly controlled process can have the effect of
privileging positions already captured in documents, which might
disadvantage alternative viewpoints.[¶](#section-5-4){.pilcrow}

::: {#mode-doc}
::: {#section-5.1 .section}
### [5.1.](#section-5.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Document Management Mode](#name-document-management-mode){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-document-management-mode}

In this mode of interaction, GitHub repositories are used to manage
changes to documents, but the bulk of the work is conducted using email,
face-to-face meetings, and other more traditional interactions. The
intent of this policy is to enable document and issue management using
GitHub while minimizing the complexity of the
process.[¶](#section-5.1-1){.pilcrow}

In the version of this mode with the least interaction with GitHub, a
repository is created for the purposes of document management by
editors. Editors might maintain issues and pull requests for their own
benefit, but these have no formal standing in the working group
process.[¶](#section-5.1-2){.pilcrow}
:::

::: {#section-5.2 .section}
### [5.2.](#section-5.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Issue Tracking Mode](#name-issue-tracking-mode){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-issue-tracking-mode}

In addition to managing documents, the working group might choose to use
GitHub for tracking outstanding issues. In this mode of interaction, a
record of the existence of substantive technical discussions is tracked
using issues in the issue tracker. However, discussion of any
substantial matters is always conducted on mailing
lists.[¶](#section-5.2-1){.pilcrow}

Under this mode, issues and pull requests can be opened by anyone, but
anything deemed substantive [MUST]{.bcp14} be resolved exclusively on
the mailing list. Discussion on GitHub is limited to recording the state
of issues. Only editorial matters can be resolved using the issue
tracker.[¶](#section-5.2-2){.pilcrow}

Chairs and editors are given discretion in determining what issues are
substantive. As documents mature, it is generally prudent to prefer
consulting the mailing list where there is doubt. As with other working
group decisions, chairs are the arbiters in case of
dispute.[¶](#section-5.2-3){.pilcrow}

A recurrent problem with this mode of interaction is the tendency for
discussions to spontaneously develop in the issue tracker. This requires
a degree of discipline from chairs and editors to ensure that any
substantive matters are taken to the mailing
list.[¶](#section-5.2-4){.pilcrow}

Retaining mailing lists as the primary venue for discussion of
substantive matters ensures that this mode, along with the document
management mode, is most compatible with existing work practices for
working groups. Participants in a working group that operates under
either model can reasonably be expected to receive all relevant
communication about the work of the group from the working group mailing
list.[¶](#section-5.2-5){.pilcrow}

Though the mailing list is used for making decisions, the issue tracker
can still be a useful record of the state of issues. It is often useful
if chairs or editors record details of decisions in issue comments when
closing issues as resolved.[¶](#section-5.2-6){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-5.3 .section}
### [5.3.](#section-5.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Issue Discussion Mode](#name-issue-discussion-mode){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-issue-discussion-mode}

This GitHub interaction mode differs from the other modes in that
discussion relating to substantive technical matters is allowed to occur
on GitHub issues. Though decisions are always subject to confirmation on
the mailing list, participants are permitted to conduct substantive
discussions on the issue tracker. In some cases, this can include making
some decisions without involving the working group mailing
list.[¶](#section-5.3-1){.pilcrow}

A working group mailing list remains a critical venue for decision
making, even where issue discussion occurs elsewhere. Working group
mailing lists generally include a wider audience than those who follow
issue discussion, so difficult issues always benefit from list
discussion.[¶](#section-5.3-2){.pilcrow}

Decisions about working group consensus [MUST]{.bcp14} always be
confirmed using the working group mailing list. However, depending on
the maturity of documents, this might be a more lightweight interaction
such as sending an email confirmation for an initial set of resolutions
arising from discussions on the issue
tracker.[¶](#section-5.3-3){.pilcrow}

Using the mailing list to resolve difficult or controversial issues is
strongly encouraged. In those cases, the issue tracker might be used to
more fully develop an understanding of problems before initiating a
discussion on the mailing list, along lines similar to the design team
process (see [Section
6.5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2418#section-6.5){.relref} of
\[[RFC2418](#RFC2418){.xref}\]).[¶](#section-5.3-4){.pilcrow}

As a more involved process, adopting this mode can require changes in
policies as documents become more mature.[¶](#section-5.3-5){.pilcrow}

::: {#early-design-phases}
::: {#section-5.3.1 .section}
#### [5.3.1.](#section-5.3.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Early Design Phases](#name-early-design-phases){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-early-design-phases}

During early phases of the design of a protocol, chairs [MAY]{.bcp14}
allow editors to manage all aspects of issues. Editors are permitted to
make decisions about how to both identify and resolve technical issues,
including making any changes that editors feel
necessary.[¶](#section-5.3.1-1){.pilcrow}

The primary reason to grant editors more discretionary power is to
improve the speed with which changes can be made. In many cases,
documents that are adopted by a working group are already sufficiently
mature, and a looser process is not beneficial. A looser process
increases the risk of missing issues that need working group consensus
and integrating substantive changes based on decisions that don\'t
reflect the consensus of the working
group.[¶](#section-5.3.1-2){.pilcrow}

Changes made by editors under this process do not lack options for
identifying and correcting problems. GitHub and Git provide tools for
ensuring that changes are tracked and can be audited. Within the usual
working group process, it is expected that Internet-Drafts will receive
regular review. Also, process checkpoints like Working Group Last Call
(WGLC; [Section
7.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2418#section-7.4){.relref} of
\[[RFC2418](#RFC2418){.xref}\]) provide additional safeguards against
abuse.[¶](#section-5.3.1-3){.pilcrow}

Working groups are advised against allowing editors this degree of
flexibility for the entirety of a document life cycle. Once a document
is more stable and mature, it could be useful to move to a more tightly
controlled process.[¶](#section-5.3.1-4){.pilcrow}

#### [5.3.2.](#section-5.3.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Managing Mature Documents](#name-managing-mature-documents){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-managing-mature-documents}

As a document matures, it becomes more important to understand not just
that the document as a whole retains the support of the working group,
but that changes are not made without wider
consultation.[¶](#section-5.3.2-1){.pilcrow}

Chairs [MAY]{.bcp14} choose to manage the process of deciding which
issues are substantive. For instance, chairs might reserve the ability
to use the `design` label for new issues (see [Section
5.4.1](#label-design){.xref}) and to close issues marked as `design`.
Chairs [SHOULD]{.bcp14} always allow document editors to identify and
address editorial issues as they see fit.[¶](#section-5.3.2-2){.pilcrow}

As documents mature further, explicit confirmation of technical
decisions with the working group mailing list becomes more
important.[¶](#section-5.3.2-3){.pilcrow}

Chairs can declare working group consensus regarding the resolution of
issues in the abstract, allowing editors discretion on how to capture
the decisions in documents.[¶](#section-5.3.2-4){.pilcrow}

More mature documents require not only consensus, but consensus about
specific text. Ideally, substantive changes to documents that have
passed WGLC are proposed as pull requests and [MUST]{.bcp14} be
discussed on the mailing list. Having chairs explicitly confirm
consensus on changes ensures that previous consensus decisions are not
overturned without cause. Chairs [MAY]{.bcp14} institute this stricter
process prior to WGLC.[¶](#section-5.3.2-5){.pilcrow}

Note: It is generally sufficient to trust editors to manage adherence
with these policies, aided by the transparency provided by the version
control system. There are tools that can be used to more tightly control
access to repositories, but they can be overly
constraining.[¶](#section-5.3.2-6.1){.pilcrow}

might be applied.[¶](#section-5.4-1){.pilcrow}

A design/editorial split (see [Section 5.4.1](#label-design){.xref}) is

distinction sufficient for their needs.[¶](#section-5.4-2){.pilcrow}

Working groups or editors might use additional labels as they choose.
Any label that is used as part of a process requires that the process be
documented and announced by working group chairs. Editors
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} be permitted to use labels to manage issues without any
formal process significance being attached to those
issues.[¶](#section-5.4-3){.pilcrow}

The most important distinction about an issue is whether it is
substantive. The labels of `editorial` and `design` are used to
represent this distinction.[¶](#section-5.4.1-1){.pilcrow}

An issue labeled as `editorial` has no substantive effect on a document
except to the extent that addressing the issue might make understanding
the specification easier. Resolution of `editorial` issues can be left
to the discretion of editors.[¶](#section-5.4.1-2){.pilcrow}

An issue labeled as `design` has or might have a substantive effect on a
document. For protocol specifications, a `design` issue is one that
might affect implementations or interoperability requirements.
Addressing a `design` issue ultimately requires working group consensus,
even if the resolution is to make no
change.[¶](#section-5.4.1-3){.pilcrow}

This distinction can be applied to all types of documents. For instance,
a `design` issue for an Informational document might be raised to
discuss possible changes to important concepts in the
document.[¶](#section-5.4.1-4){.pilcrow}

Labels can be used to manage processes. As documents mature and issues
become more numerous, labels can be used to clearly mark the status of
issues. In particular, the labeling of issues can be used to help manage
working group decisions.[¶](#section-5.4.2-1){.pilcrow}

For documents that are less mature, issues with resolutions but no
specific proposals for changes to text might be marked `editor-ready` as
a way of signaling that there is consensus on an approach, but no
specific proposal. Chairs might use this to signal that discussion is
complete and that editors are to be given discretion in the construction
of text.[¶](#section-5.4.2-2){.pilcrow}

In contrast, if specific text is a prerequisite for resolving issues, as
might be the case for more mature documents, a `proposal-ready` label
might be used by editors to mark issues that they believe to have
acceptable resolutions.[¶](#section-5.4.2-3){.pilcrow}

For resolved issues, a `has-consensus` label might be used by chairs to
mark issues for which formal working group decisions have been made
([Section
6.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2418#section-6.1){.relref} of
\[[RFC2418](#RFC2418){.xref}\]).[¶](#section-5.4.2-4){.pilcrow}

A `future` or `next-version` label might be used to mark and thereby
save issues for a future version of, or extension to, a protocol,
particularly where a resolution is made to take no
action.[¶](#section-5.4.2-5){.pilcrow}

Repositories with multiple interrelated documents or a complex document
with multiple logical components might benefit from labels that identify
different aspects of the work. The choice of appropriate labels for
components will depend on the structure of specific
documents.[¶](#section-5.4.3-1){.pilcrow}

Other labels can be used depending on the needs of editors and working
group processes. For example,[¶](#section-5.4.4-1){.pilcrow}

-   [An `invalid` label might be used for issues that were raised in
    error.[¶](#section-5.4.4-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.4.4-2.1}

    an external process or related
    issue.[¶](#section-5.4.4-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.4.4-2.2}
-   [A `parked` label might be used to indicate issues that do not

## [6.](#section-6){.section-number .selfRef} [Internet-Draft Publication](#name-internet-draft-publication){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-internet-draft-publication}

During the development of a document, individual revisions of the
document can be built and formally submitted as an Internet-Draft. This
creates a stable snapshot and makes the content of the in-progress
document available to a wider audience. Documents submitted as
Internet-Drafts are not expected to address all open issues or merge
outstanding pull requests.[¶](#section-6-1){.pilcrow}

[Section
7.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2418#section-7.1){.relref} of
\[[RFC2418](#RFC2418){.xref}\] recommends that editors create a new
Internet-Draft submission two weeks prior to every session, which
includes IETF meetings, other in-person meetings, and telephone or video
conferences. Though discussion could use the current version of a
document from version control, participants in a session cannot be
expected to monitor changes to documents in real time; a published
Internet-Draft ensures that there is a common, stable state that is
known to all participants.[¶](#section-6-2){.pilcrow}

Internet-Drafts that use a GitHub repository [SHOULD]{.bcp14} include a
notice that includes a reference to the repository. This notice might
also include information about where to discuss the
draft.[¶](#section-6-3){.pilcrow}

Revisions used to generate documents that are submitted as
Internet-Drafts [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be tagged in repositories to provide a
record of submissions.[¶](#section-6-4){.pilcrow}

Working group chairs [MAY]{.bcp14} request a revision of an
Internet-Draft being managed on GitHub at any time, in consultation with
document editors.[¶](#section-6-5){.pilcrow}

::: {#assessing-consensus}
::: {#section-7 .section}
## [7.](#section-7){.section-number .selfRef} [Assessing Consensus](#name-assessing-consensus){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-assessing-consensus}

The work that occurs on GitHub could be part of the consensus process,
but the ultimate decision on consensus regarding a document is made by
the chairs \[[RFC2026](#RFC2026){.xref}\].[¶](#section-7-1){.pilcrow}

GitHub facilitates more involved interactions, which can result in a
much higher level of activity than a typical working group mailing list.
Participants who wish to limit their time commitment might follow GitHub
activity selectively, either by following only specific issues or by
occasionally reviewing the state of the document. Other participants
might not use GitHub at all. Chairs are reminded that assessing
consensus based on GitHub content alone cannot be assumed to reach all
interested participants.[¶](#section-7-2){.pilcrow}

As described in \[[RFC2418](#RFC2418){.xref}\], chairs consider input
from all discussion venues when assessing consensus. These include
mailing lists, IETF meetings, and interim meetings in addition to
discussion on GitHub. Each venue has different selection biases that
might need to be considered.[¶](#section-7-3){.pilcrow}

A working group chair [MUST]{.bcp14} consult the working group mailing
list for any issue that is potentially contentious. Relying on input
provided through GitHub alone might result in gaining input from a
narrower set of participants. This includes important milestones like
Working Group Last Call, where review from the widest possible audience
ensures a higher quality document.[¶](#section-7-4){.pilcrow}

If permitted, GitHub will be used for technical discussion and
decisions, especially during early stages of development of a document.
Any decisions are confirmed through review within the working group and,
ultimately, through Working Group Last Call; see [Section
7.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2418#section-7.4){.relref} of
\[[RFC2418](#RFC2418){.xref}\].[¶](#section-7-5){.pilcrow}

The use of issues and labels has been effective in managing contentious
issues. Explicitly labeling closed issues to identify those with formal
consensus means that there is no confusion about the status of
issues.[¶](#section-7-6){.pilcrow}

::: {#continuous-integration}
::: {#section-8 .section}
## [8.](#section-8){.section-number .selfRef} [Continuous Integration](#name-continuous-integration){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-continuous-integration}

Various third-party services offer the ability to run tests and other
work when changes are made to a repository.[¶](#section-8-1){.pilcrow}

One common practice is to use these continuous integration services to
build a text or HTML version of a document. This is then published to
GitHub Pages, which allows users to view a version of the most recent
revision of a document. Including a prominent link to this version of
the document (such as in the README) makes it easier for new
contributors to find a readable copy of the most recent version of a
draft. In addition, including links to differences between this
generated version and any published document helps contributors identify
recent changes.[¶](#section-8-2){.pilcrow}

Continuous integration can also validate pull requests and other changes
for errors. The most basic check is whether the source file can be
transformed successfully into a valid Internet-Draft. For example, this
might include checking that the XML source is syntactically
correct.[¶](#section-8-3){.pilcrow}

For a document that uses formal languages as part of the specification,
such as schema or source code, a continuous integration system might
also be used to validate any formal language that the document contains.
Tests for any source code that the document contains might be run, or
examples might be checked for correctness.[¶](#section-8-4){.pilcrow}

## [9.](#section-9){.section-number .selfRef} [Advice to Editors](#name-advice-to-editors){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-advice-to-editors}

Document editors are primarily responsible for maintaining documents.
Taking on a few additional tasks can greatly improve the process for the
working group.[¶](#section-9-1){.pilcrow}

Using GitHub means that it is more likely that a contribution is made by
users who are not very familiar with the work. Pull requests from new
contributors can contain errors or omissions. Duplicate issues are
commonplace. Proposed changes might have grammatical errors or they
might diverge from existing style. If a change is generally sound,
rather than rejecting the pull request or requesting changes, editors
could instead accept the change and then make any necessary
corrections.[¶](#section-9-2){.pilcrow}

Editors [SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} close a pull request or issue without first
understanding why the item was created. Editors and chairs
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} try to explain every action clearly and concisely. Even
if a contributor seems rude, being courteous in response is always
best.[¶](#section-9-3){.pilcrow}

If a contributor makes a comment that raises a new issue, editors can
create an issue or, if there is an obvious solution, a pull request. It
does not matter what venue the issue was raised in (e.g., email, issue
discussion, a pull request review); capturing issues quickly ensures
that problems become visible and can be
tracked.[¶](#section-9-4){.pilcrow}

This takes a little more effort, but these simple steps can help
encourage contributions, which will ultimately improve the quality of
documents.[¶](#section-9-5){.pilcrow}

Continuity of operations is always a consideration when taking a
dependency on an external service. If GitHub were to fail in some way,
anyone relying upon its services would be seriously
affected.[¶](#section-10-1){.pilcrow}

Widespread use of Git reduces the exposure to a system failure because
the primary repository is replicated in multiple locations. This
includes hosted web pages; the content of web pages is maintained as a
branch in the main repository.[¶](#section-10-2){.pilcrow}

However, other information maintained on GitHub is more vulnerable to
loss. This includes issues and discussion on those issues, discussion
and reviews of commits and pull requests, and any content hosted on the
wiki. Tools exist for extracting this information for
backup.[¶](#section-10-3){.pilcrow}

As specified in \[[RFC8875](#RFC8875){.xref}\], backup copies of
repositories and other important data [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be
maintained.[¶](#section-10-4){.pilcrow}

The potential for malicious actions by compromised or malcontent
editors, chairs, and area directors is relevant in maintaining the
integrity of the content that GitHub hosts. Backups allow for recovery
of content, and regular submissions as Internet-Drafts ensure that work
is not lost completely.[¶](#section-10-5){.pilcrow}

A compromise of GitHub does not pose a significant threat to working
group operations as it is expected that most data, aside from individual
credentials, is made public.[¶](#section-10-6){.pilcrow}

A compromise of credentials could mean loss of control for repositories
an organizations. All contributors, especially those with commit or
admin privileges [SHOULD]{.bcp14} use current best practices for
protection of credentials, such as multi-factor
authentication.[¶](#section-10-7){.pilcrow}
