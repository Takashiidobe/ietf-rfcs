# The \'I\' in RPKI Does Not Stand for Identity {#title}

## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

There is a false notion that Internet Number Resources (INRs) in the
RPKI can be associated with the real-world identity of the \'holder\' of
an INR. This document specifies that RPKI does not associate to the INR
holder.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

The Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI), see
\[[RFC6480](#RFC6480){.xref}\], \"represents the allocation hierarchy of
IP address space and Autonomous System (AS) numbers,\" which are
collectively known as Internet Number Resources (INRs). Since initial
deployment, the RPKI has grown to include other similar resource and
routing data, e.g., Router Keying for BGPsec
\[[RFC8635](#RFC8635){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

In security terms, the phrase \"Public Key\" implies there is also a
corresponding private key \[[RFC5280](#RFC5280){.xref}\]. The RPKI
provides strong authority to the current holder of INRs; however, some
people have a desire to use RPKI private keys to sign arbitrary
documents as the INR \'holder\' of those resources with the
inappropriate expectation that the signature will be considered an
attestation to the authenticity of the document content. But, in
reality, the RPKI certificate is only an authorization to speak for the
explicitly identified INRs; it is explicitly not intended for
authentication of the \'holders\' of the INRs. This situation is
emphasized in [Section
2.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6480#section-2.1){.relref} of
\[[RFC6480](#RFC6480){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

It has been suggested that one could authenticate real-world business
transactions with the signatures of INR holders. For example, Bill\'s
Bait and Sushi (BB&S) could use the private key attesting to that they
are the holder of their AS in the RPKI to sign a Letter of Authorization
(LOA) for some other party to rack and stack hardware owned by BB&S.
Unfortunately, while this may be technically possible, it is neither
appropriate nor meaningful.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

The \'I\' in RPKI actually stands for \"Infrastructure,\" as in Resource
Public Key Infrastructure, not for \"Identity\". In fact, the RPKI does
not provide any association between INRs and the real-world holder(s) of
those INRs. The RPKI provides authorization to make assertions only
regarding Internet Number Resources, such as IP prefixes or AS numbers,
and data such as [Autonomous System Provider Authorization (ASPA)
records](#I-D.ietf-sidrops-aspa-profile){.xref}
\[[ASPA-PROFILE](#I-D.ietf-sidrops-aspa-profile){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

In short, avoid the desire to use RPKI certificates for any purpose
other than the verification of authorizations associated with the
delegation of INRs or attestations related to INRs. Instead, recognize
that these authorizations and attestations take place irrespective of
the identity of an RPKI private key holder.[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}

The RPKI was designed and specified to sign certificates for use within
the RPKI itself and to generate Route Origin Authorizations (ROAs)
\[[RFC6480](#RFC6480){.xref}\] for use in routing. Its design
intentionally precluded use for attesting to real-world identity as,
among other issues, it would expose the Certification Authority (CA) to
liability.[¶](#section-2-1){.pilcrow}

That the RPKI does not authenticate real-world identity is by design. If
it tried to do so, aside from the liability, it would end in a world of
complexity with no proof of termination.[¶](#section-2-2){.pilcrow}

Registries such as the Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) provide INR
to real-world identity mapping through WHOIS
\[[RFC3912](#RFC3912){.xref}\] and similar services. They claim to be
authoritative, at least for the INRs that they
allocate.[¶](#section-2-3){.pilcrow}

That is, RPKI-based credentials of INRs [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be used to
authenticate real-world documents or transactions. That might be done
with some formal external authentication of authority allowing an
otherwise anonymous INR holder to authenticate the particular document
or transaction. Given such external, i.e. non-RPKI, verification of
authority, the use of RPKI-based credentials adds no
authenticity.[¶](#section-2-4){.pilcrow}

[Section
2.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6480#section-2.1){.relref} of the
RPKI base document \[[RFC6480](#RFC6480){.xref}\] says explicitly \"An
important property of this PKI is that certificates do not attest to the
identity of the subject.\"[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

[Section
3.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7382#section-3.1){.relref} of
\"Template for a Certification Practice Statement (CPS) for the Resource
PKI (RPKI)\" \[[RFC7382](#RFC7382){.xref}\] states that the Subject name
in each certificate SHOULD NOT be meaningful and goes on to explain this
at some length.[¶](#section-3-2){.pilcrow}

Normally, the INR holder does not hold the private key attesting to
their resources; the CA does. The INR holder has a real-world business
relationship with the CA for which they have likely signed real-world
documents.[¶](#section-3-3){.pilcrow}

As the INR holder does not have the keying material, they rely on the
CA, to which they presumably present credentials, to manipulate their
INRs. These credentials may be user ID and password (with two-factor
authentication one hopes), a hardware token, client browser
certificates, etc.[¶](#section-3-4){.pilcrow}

Hence schemes such as Resource Tagged Attestations
\[[RPKI-RTA](#I-D.ietf-sidrops-rpki-rta){.xref}\] and Signed Checklists
\[[RPKI-RSC](#I-D.ietf-sidrops-rpki-rsc){.xref}\] must go to great
lengths to extract the supposedly relevant keys from the
CA.[¶](#section-3-5){.pilcrow}

For some particular INR, say, Bill\'s Bait and Sushi\'s Autonomous
System (AS) number, someone out on the net probably has the credentials
to the CA account in which BB&S\'s INRs are registered. That could be
the owner of BB&S, Randy\'s Taco Stand, an IT vendor, or the Government
of Elbonia. One simply can not know.[¶](#section-3-6){.pilcrow}

In large organizations, INR management is often compartmentalized with
no authority over anything beyond dealing with INR registration. The INR
manager for Bill\'s Bait and Sushi is unlikely to be authorized to
conduct bank transactions for BB&S, or even to authorize access to
BB&S\'s servers in some colocation facility.[¶](#section-3-7){.pilcrow}

Then there is the temporal issue. The holder of that AS may be BB&S
today when some document was signed, and could be the Government of
Elbonia tomorrow. Or the resource could have been administratively moved
from one CA to another, likely requiring a change of keys. If so, how
does one determine if the signature on the real-world document is still
valid?[¶](#section-3-8){.pilcrow}

While Ghostbuster Records \[[RFC6493](#RFC6493){.xref}\] may seem to
identify real-world entities, their semantic content is completely
arbitrary and does not attest to holding of any INRs. They are merely
clues for operational support contact in case of technical RPKI
problems.[¶](#section-3-9){.pilcrow}

Usually, before registering INRs, CAs require proof of an INR holding
via external documentation and authorities. It is somewhat droll that
the CPS Template \[[RFC7382](#RFC7382){.xref}\] does not mention any
diligence the CA must, or even might, conduct to assure the INRs are in
fact owned by a registrant.[¶](#section-3-10){.pilcrow}

That someone can provide \'proof of possession\' of the private key
signing over a particular INR should not be taken to imply that they are
a valid legal representative of the organization in possession of that
INR. They could be in an INR administrative role, and not be a formal
representative of the organization.[¶](#section-3-11){.pilcrow}

Autonomous System Numbers do not identify real-world entities. They are
identifiers some network operators \'own\' and are only used for loop
detection in routing. They have no inherent semantics other than
uniqueness.[¶](#section-3-12){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-4 .section}
## [4.](#section-4){.section-number .selfRef} [Security Considerations](#name-security-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-security-considerations}

Attempts to use RPKI data to authenticate real-world documents or other
artifacts requiring identity, while possibly cryptographically valid
within the RPKI, are misleading as to any
authenticity.[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

When a document is signed with the private key associated with an RPKI
certificate, the signer is speaking for the INRs (the IP address space
and AS numbers) in the certificate. This is not an identity; this is an
authorization. In schemes such as Resource Tagged Attestations
\[[RPKI-RTA](#I-D.ietf-sidrops-rpki-rta){.xref}\] and Signed Checklists
\[[RPKI-RSC](#I-D.ietf-sidrops-rpki-rsc){.xref}\], the signed message
further narrows this scope of INRs. The INRs in the message are a subset
of the INRs in the certificate. If the signature is valid, the message
content comes from a party that is authorized to speak for that subset
of INRs.[¶](#section-4-2){.pilcrow}

Control of INRs for an entity could be used to falsely authorize
transactions or documents for which the INR manager has no
authority.[¶](#section-4-3){.pilcrow}
