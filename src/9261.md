# RFC 9261 {#rfcnum}

# Exported Authenticators in TLS {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

This document describes a mechanism that builds on Transport Layer
Security (TLS) or Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) and enables
peers to provide proof of ownership of an identity, such as an X.509
certificate. This proof can be exported by one peer, transmitted out of
band to the other peer, and verified by the receiving
peer.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

This document provides a way to authenticate one party of a Transport
Layer Security (TLS) or Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)
connection to its peer using authentication messages created after the
session has been established. This allows both the client and server to
prove ownership of additional identities at any time after the handshake
has completed. This proof of authentication can be exported and
transmitted out of band from one party to be validated by its
peer.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

This mechanism provides two advantages over the authentication that TLS
and DTLS natively provide:[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

multiple identities:
:   Endpoints that are authoritative for multiple identities, but that
    do not have a single certificate that includes all of the
    identities, can authenticate additional identities over a single
    connection.[¶](#section-1-3.2){.pilcrow}
:   

spontaneous authentication:
:   After a connection is established, endpoints can authenticate in
    response to events in a higher-layer protocol; they can also
    integrate more context (such as context from the
    application).[¶](#section-1-3.4){.pilcrow}
:   

Versions of TLS prior to TLS 1.3 used renegotiation as a way to enable
post-handshake client authentication given an existing TLS connection.
The mechanism described in this document may be used to replace the
post-handshake authentication functionality provided by renegotiation.
Unlike renegotiation, Exported Authenticator-based post-handshake
authentication does not require any changes at the TLS
layer.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

Post-handshake authentication is defined in TLS 1.3 [Section
4.6.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8446#section-4.6.2){.relref} of
\[[RFC8446](#RFC8446){.xref}\], but it has the disadvantage of requiring
additional state to be stored as part of the TLS state machine.
Furthermore, the authentication boundaries of TLS 1.3 post-handshake
authentication align with TLS record boundaries, which are often not
aligned with the authentication boundaries of the higher-layer protocol.
For example, multiplexed connection protocols like HTTP/2
\[[RFC9113](#RFC9113){.xref}\] do not have a notion of which TLS record
a given message is a part of.[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}

Exported Authenticators are meant to be used as a building block for
application protocols. Mechanisms such as those required to advertise
support and handle authentication errors are not handled by TLS (or
DTLS).[¶](#section-1-6){.pilcrow}

The minimum version of TLS and DTLS required to implement the mechanisms
described in this document are TLS 1.2 \[[RFC5246](#RFC5246){.xref}\]
and DTLS 1.2 \[[RFC6347](#RFC6347){.xref}\]. (These were obsoleted by
TLS 1.3 \[[RFC8446](#RFC8446){.xref}\] and DTLS 1.3
\[[RFC9147](#RFC9147){.xref}\].)[¶](#section-1-7){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-4 .section}
## [4.](#section-4){.section-number .selfRef} [Authenticator Request](#name-authenticator-request){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-authenticator-request}

The authenticator request is a structured message that can be created by
either party of a (D)TLS connection using data exported from that
connection. It can be transmitted to the other party of the (D)TLS
connection at the application layer. The application-layer protocol used
to send the authenticator request [SHOULD]{.bcp14} use a secure
transport channel with equivalent security to TLS, such as QUIC
\[[RFC9001](#RFC9001){.xref}\], as its underlying transport to keep the
request confidential. The application [MAY]{.bcp14} use the existing
(D)TLS connection to transport the
authenticator.[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

An authenticator request message can be constructed by either the client
or the server. Server-generated authenticator requests use the
CertificateRequest message from [Section
4.3.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8446#section-4.3.2){.relref} of
\[[RFC8446](#RFC8446){.xref}\]. Client-generated authenticator requests
use a new message, called the \"ClientCertificateRequest\", that uses
the same structure as CertificateRequest. (Note that the latter is not a
request for a client certificate, but rather a certificate request
generated by the client.) These message structures are used even if the
connection protocol is TLS 1.2 or DTLS 1.2.[¶](#section-4-2){.pilcrow}

The CertificateRequest and ClientCertificateRequest messages are used to
define the parameters in a request for an authenticator. These are
encoded as TLS handshake messages, including length and type fields.
They do not include any TLS record-layer framing and are not encrypted
with a handshake or application-data key.[¶](#section-4-3){.pilcrow}

The structures are defined to be:[¶](#section-4-4){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-4-5}
``` {.lang-tls-presentation .sourcecode}
   struct {
      opaque certificate_request_context<0..2^8-1>;
      Extension extensions<2..2^16-1>;
   } ClientCertificateRequest;

   struct {
      opaque certificate_request_context<0..2^8-1>;
      Extension extensions<2..2^16-1>;
   } CertificateRequest;
```

[¶](#section-4-5){.pilcrow}
:::

[]{.break}

certificate_request_context:
:   An opaque string that identifies the authenticator request and that
    will be echoed in the authenticator message. A
    certificate_request_context value [MUST]{.bcp14} be unique for each
    authenticator request within the scope of a connection (preventing
    replay and context confusion). The certificate_request_context
    [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be chosen to be unpredictable to the peer (e.g., by
    randomly generating it) in order to prevent an attacker who has
    temporary access to the peer\'s private key from precomputing valid
    authenticators. For example, the application may choose this value
    to correspond to a value used in an existing data structure in the
    software to simplify implementation.[¶](#section-4-6.2){.pilcrow}
:   

extensions:
:   The set of extensions allowed in the structures of
    CertificateRequest and ClientCertificateRequest is comprised of
    those defined in the \"TLS ExtensionType Values\" IANA registry
    containing CR in the \"TLS 1.3\" column (see
    \[[IANA-TLS](#IANA-TLS){.xref}\] and
    \[[RFC8447](#RFC8447){.xref}\]). In addition, the set of extensions
    in the ClientCertificateRequest structure [MAY]{.bcp14} include the
    server_name extension
    \[[RFC6066](#RFC6066){.xref}\].[¶](#section-4-6.4){.pilcrow}
:   

The uniqueness requirements of the certificate_request_context apply
across CertificateRequest and ClientCertificateRequest messages that are
used as part of authenticator requests. A certificate_request_context
value used in a ClientCertificateRequest cannot be used in an
authenticator CertificateRequest on the same connection, and vice versa.
There is no impact if the value of a certificate_request_context used in
an authenticator request matches the value of a
certificate_request_context in the handshake or in a post-handshake
message.[¶](#section-4-7){.pilcrow}
:::
:::

::: {#authenticator}
::: {#section-5 .section}
## [5.](#section-5){.section-number .selfRef} [Authenticator](#name-authenticator){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-authenticator}

The authenticator is a structured message that can be exported from
either party of a (D)TLS connection. It can be transmitted to the other
party of the (D)TLS connection at the application layer. The
application-layer protocol used to send the authenticator
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} use a secure transport channel with equivalent security
to TLS, such as QUIC \[[RFC9001](#RFC9001){.xref}\], as its underlying
transport to keep the authenticator confidential. The application
[MAY]{.bcp14} use the existing (D)TLS connection to transport the
authenticator.[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

An authenticator message can be constructed by either the client or the
server given an established (D)TLS connection; an identity, such as an
X.509 certificate; and a corresponding private key. Clients [MUST
NOT]{.bcp14} send an authenticator without a preceding authenticator
request; for servers, an authenticator request is optional. For
authenticators that do not correspond to authenticator requests, the
certificate_request_context is chosen by the
server.[¶](#section-5-2){.pilcrow}

::: {#authenticator-keys}
::: {#section-5.1 .section}
### [5.1.](#section-5.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Authenticator Keys](#name-authenticator-keys){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-authenticator-keys}

Each authenticator is computed using a Handshake Context and Finished
MAC (Message Authentication Code) Key derived from the (D)TLS
connection. These values are derived using an exporter as described in
[Section 4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5705#section-4){.relref}
of \[[RFC5705](#RFC5705){.xref}\] (for (D)TLS 1.2) or [Section
7.5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8446#section-7.5){.relref} of
\[[RFC8446](#RFC8446){.xref}\] (for (D)TLS 1.3). For (D)TLS 1.3, the
exporter_master_secret [MUST]{.bcp14} be used, not the
early_exporter_master_secret. These values use different labels
depending on the role of the sender:[¶](#section-5.1-1){.pilcrow}

-   [The Handshake Context is an exporter value that is derived using
    the label \"EXPORTER-client authenticator handshake context\" or
    \"EXPORTER-server authenticator handshake context\" for
    authenticators sent by the client or server,
    respectively.[¶](#section-5.1-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.1-2.1}
-   [The Finished MAC Key is an exporter value derived using the label
    \"EXPORTER-client authenticator finished key\" or \"EXPORTER-server
    authenticator finished key\" for authenticators sent by the client
    or server,
    respectively.[¶](#section-5.1-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.1-2.2}

The context_value used for the exporter is empty (zero length) for all
four values. There is no need to include additional context information
at this stage because the application-supplied context is included in
the authenticator itself. The length of the exported value is equal to
the length of the output of the hash function associated with the
selected ciphersuite (for TLS 1.3) or the hash function used for the
pseudorandom function (PRF) (for (D)TLS 1.2). Exported Authenticators
cannot be used with (D)TLS 1.2 ciphersuites that do not use the TLS PRF
and with TLS 1.3 ciphersuites that do not have an associated hash
function. This hash is referred to as the \"authenticator
hash\".[¶](#section-5.1-3){.pilcrow}

To avoid key synchronization attacks, Exported Authenticators [MUST
NOT]{.bcp14} be generated or accepted on (D)TLS 1.2 connections that did
not negotiate the extended master secret extension
\[[RFC7627](#RFC7627){.xref}\].[¶](#section-5.1-4){.pilcrow}
:::

::: {#authenticator-construction}
::: {#section-5.2 .section}
### [5.2.](#section-5.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Authenticator Construction](#name-authenticator-construction){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-authenticator-construction}

An authenticator is formed from the concatenation of TLS 1.3
Certificate, CertificateVerify, and Finished messages
\[[RFC8446](#RFC8446){.xref}\]. These messages are encoded as TLS
handshake messages, including length and type fields. They do not
include any TLS record-layer framing and are not encrypted with a
handshake or application-data key.[¶](#section-5.2-1){.pilcrow}

If the peer populating the certificate_request_context field in an
authenticator\'s Certificate message has already created or correctly
validated an authenticator with the same value, then no authenticator
should be constructed. If there is no authenticator request, the
extensions are chosen from those presented in the (D)TLS handshake\'s
ClientHello. Only servers can provide an authenticator without a
corresponding request.[¶](#section-5.2-2){.pilcrow}

ClientHello extensions are used to determine permissible extensions in
the server\'s unsolicited Certificate message in order to follow the
general model for extensions in (D)TLS in which extensions can only be
included as part of a Certificate message if they were previously sent
as part of a CertificateRequest message or ClientHello message. This
ensures that the recipient will be able to process such
extensions.[¶](#section-5.2-3){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-5.2.1 .section}
#### [5.2.1.](#section-5.2.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Certificate](#name-certificate){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-certificate}

The Certificate message contains the identity to be used for
authentication, such as the end-entity certificate and any supporting
certificates in the chain. This structure is defined in [Section
4.4.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8446#section-4.4.2){.relref} of
\[[RFC8446](#RFC8446){.xref}\].[¶](#section-5.2.1-1){.pilcrow}

The Certificate message contains an opaque string called
\"certificate_request_context\", which is extracted from the
authenticator request, if present. If no authenticator request is
provided, the certificate_request_context can be chosen arbitrarily;
however, it [MUST]{.bcp14} be unique within the scope of the connection
and be unpredictable to the peer.[¶](#section-5.2.1-2){.pilcrow}

Certificates chosen in the Certificate message [MUST]{.bcp14} conform to
the requirements of a Certificate message in the negotiated version of
(D)TLS. In particular, the entries of certificate_list [MUST]{.bcp14} be
valid for the signature algorithms indicated by the peer in the
\"signature_algorithms\" and \"signature_algorithms_cert\" extensions,
as described in [Section
4.2.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8446#section-4.2.3){.relref} of
\[[RFC8446](#RFC8446){.xref}\] for (D)TLS 1.3 or in Sections
[7.4.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5246#section-7.4.2){.relref}
and
[7.4.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5246#section-7.4.6){.relref}
of \[[RFC5246](#RFC5246){.xref}\] for (D)TLS
1.2.[¶](#section-5.2.1-3){.pilcrow}

In addition to \"signature_algorithms\" and

This message is used to provide explicit proof that an endpoint

The algorithm field specifies the signature algorithm used (see [Section
4.2.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8446#section-4.2.3){.relref} of
\[[RFC8446](#RFC8446){.xref}\] for the definition of this field). The
signature is a digital signature using that
algorithm.[¶](#section-5.2.2-3){.pilcrow}

The signature scheme [MUST]{.bcp14} be a valid signature scheme for TLS
1.3. This excludes all RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 algorithms and combinations of
Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) and hash algorithms
that are not supported in TLS 1.3.[¶](#section-5.2.2-4){.pilcrow}

If an authenticator request is present, the signature algorithm
[MUST]{.bcp14} be chosen from one of the signature schemes present in
the \"signature_algorithms\" extension of the authenticator request.
Otherwise, with spontaneous server authentication, the signature
algorithm used [MUST]{.bcp14} be chosen from the
\"signature_algorithms\" sent by the peer in the ClientHello of the
(D)TLS handshake. If there are no available signature algorithms, then
no authenticator should be constructed.[¶](#section-5.2.2-5){.pilcrow}

The signature is computed using the chosen signature scheme over the
concatenation of:[¶](#section-5.2.2-6){.pilcrow}

-   [a string that consists of octet 32 (0x20) repeated 64
    times,[¶](#section-5.2.2-7.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.2.2-7.1}

-   [the hashed authenticator
    transcript.[¶](#section-5.2.2-7.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.2.2-7.4}

present, it is omitted from this construction, i.e., it is
zero-length.[¶](#section-5.2.2-10){.pilcrow}

If the party that generates the authenticator does so with a different
connection than the party that is validating it, then the Handshake
Context will not match, resulting in a CertificateVerify message that
does not validate. This includes situations in which the application
data is sent via TLS-terminating proxy. Given a failed CertificateVerify
validation, it may be helpful for the application to confirm that both
peers share the same connection using a value derived from the
connection secrets (such as the Handshake Context) before taking a
user-visible action.[¶](#section-5.2.2-11){.pilcrow}

CertificateVerify message omitted. The HMAC is computed using the
authenticator hash, using the Finished MAC Key as a key. This message is

The Certificate/Verify/Finished pattern intentionally looks like the TLS
1.3 pattern that now has been analyzed several times. For example,
\[[SIGMAC](#SIGMAC){.xref}\] presents a relevant framework for analysis,
and [Appendix
E.1.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8446#appendix-E.1.6){.relref}
of \[[RFC8446](#RFC8446){.xref}\] contains a comprehensive set of
references.[¶](#section-9-1){.pilcrow}

Authenticators are independent and unidirectional. There is no explicit
state change inside TLS when an authenticator is either created or
validated. The application in possession of a validated authenticator
can rely on any semantics associated with data in the
certificate_request_context.[¶](#section-9-2){.pilcrow}

-   [This property makes it difficult to formally prove that a server is
    jointly authoritative over multiple identities, rather than
    individually authoritative over
    each.[¶](#section-9-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-9-3.1}
-   [There is no indication in (D)TLS about which point in time an
    authenticator was computed. Any feedback about the time of creation
    or validation of the authenticator should be tracked as part of the
    application-layer semantics if
    required.[¶](#section-9-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-9-3.2}

The signatures generated with this API cover the context string
\"Exported Authenticator\"; therefore, they cannot be transplanted into
other protocols.[¶](#section-9-4){.pilcrow}

In TLS 1.3, the client cannot explicitly learn from the TLS layer
whether its Finished message was accepted. Because the application
traffic keys are not dependent on the client\'s final flight, receiving
messages from the server does not prove that the server received the
client\'s Finished message. To avoid disagreement between the client and
server on the authentication status of Exported Authenticators, servers
[MUST]{.bcp14} verify the client Finished message before sending an EA
or processing a received Exported
Authenticator.[¶](#section-9-5){.pilcrow}
