# RFC 8816 {#rfcnum}

# Secure Telephone Identity Revisited (STIR) Out-of-Band Architecture and Use Cases {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

The Personal Assertion Token (PASSporT) format defines a token that can
be carried by signaling protocols, including SIP, to cryptographically
attest the identity of callers. However, not all telephone calls use
Internet signaling protocols, and some calls use them for only part of
their signaling path, while some cannot reliably deliver SIP header
fields end-to-end. This document describes use cases that require the
delivery of PASSporT objects outside of the signaling path, and defines
architectures and semantics to provide this
functionality.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

## [1.](#section-1){.section-number .selfRef} [Introduction](#name-introduction){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-introduction}

The STIR problem statement \[[RFC7340](#RFC7340){.xref}\] describes
widespread problems enabled by impersonation in the telephone network,
including illegal robocalling, voicemail hacking, and swatting. As
telephone services are increasingly migrating onto the Internet, and
using Voice over IP (VoIP) protocols such as [SIP](#RFC3261){.xref}
\[[RFC3261](#RFC3261){.xref}\], it is necessary for these protocols to
support stronger identity mechanisms to prevent impersonation. For
example, \[[RFC8224](#RFC8224){.xref}\] defines a SIP Identity header
field capable of carrying [PASSporT objects](#RFC8225){.xref}
\[[RFC8225](#RFC8225){.xref}\] in SIP as a means to cryptographically
attest that the originator of a telephone call is authorized to use the
calling party number (or, for native SIP cases, SIP URI) associated with
the originator of the call.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

Not all telephone calls use SIP today, however, and even those that do
use SIP do not always carry SIP signaling end-to-end. Calls from
telephone numbers still routinely traverse the Public Switched Telephone
Network (PSTN) at some point. Broadly, calls fall into one of three
categories:[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

1.  [One or both of the endpoints is actually a PSTN
    endpoint.[¶](#section-1-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-3.1}
2.  [Both of the endpoints are non-PSTN (SIP, Jingle, etc.) but the call
    transits the PSTN at some
    point.[¶](#section-1-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-3.2}
3.  [Non-PSTN calls that do not transit the PSTN at all (such as native
    SIP end-to-end calls).[¶](#section-1-3.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-3.3}

The first two categories represent the majority of telephone calls
associated with problems like illegal robocalling: many robocalls today
originate on the Internet but terminate at PSTN endpoints. However, the
core network elements that operate the PSTN are legacy devices that are
unlikely to be upgradable at this point to support an in-band
authentication system. As such, those devices largely cannot be modified
to pass signatures originating on the Internet \-- or indeed any in-band
signaling data \-- intact. Even if fields for tunneling arbitrary data
can be found in traditional PSTN signaling, in some cases legacy
elements would strip the signatures from those fields; in others, they
might damage them to the point where they cannot be verified. For those
first two categories above, any in-band authentication scheme does not
seem practical in the current environment.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

While the core network of the PSTN remains fixed, the endpoints of the
telephone network are becoming increasingly programmable and
sophisticated. Landline \"plain old telephone service\" deployments,
especially in the developed world, are shrinking, and increasingly being
replaced by three classes of intelligent devices: smart phones, IP
Private Branch Exchanges (PBXs), and terminal adapters. All three are
general purpose computers, and typically all three have Internet access
as well as access to the PSTN; they may be used for residential, mobile,
or enterprise telephone services. Additionally, various kinds of
gateways increasingly front for deployments of legacy PBX and PSTN
switches. All of this provides a potential avenue for building an
authentication system that implements stronger identity while leaving
PSTN systems intact.[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}

This capability also provides an ideal transitional technology while
in-band STIR adoption is ramping up. It permits early adopters to use
the technology even when intervening network elements are not yet
STIR-aware, and through various kinds of gateways, it may allow
providers with a significant PSTN investment to still secure their calls
with STIR.[¶](#section-1-6){.pilcrow}

The techniques described in this document therefore build on the
[PASSporT](#RFC8225){.xref} \[[RFC8225](#RFC8225){.xref}\] mechanism and
the work of \[[RFC8224](#RFC8224){.xref}\] to describe a way that a
PASSporT object created in the originating network of a call can reach
the terminating network even when it cannot be carried end-to-end
in-band in the call signaling. This relies on a new service defined in
this document called a Call Placement Service (CPS) that permits the
PASSporT object to be stored during call processing and retrieved for
verification purposes.[¶](#section-1-7){.pilcrow}

Potential implementors should note that this document merely defines the
operating environments in which this out-of-band STIR mechanism is
intended to operate. It provides use cases, gives a broad description of
the components, and a potential solution architecture. Various
environments may have their own security requirements: a public
deployment of out-of-band STIR faces far greater challenges than a
constrained intra-network deployment. To flesh out the storage and
retrieval of PASSporTs in the CPS within this context, this document
includes a strawman protocol suitable for that purpose. Deploying this
framework in any given environment would require additional
specification outside the scope of this
document.[¶](#section-1-8){.pilcrow}

This section describes the environments in which the proposed
out-of-band STIR mechanism is intended to operate. In the simplest
setting, Alice calls Bob, and her call is routed through some set of
gateways and/or the PSTN that do not support end-to-end delivery of
STIR. Both Alice and Bob have smart devices that can access the Internet
(perhaps enterprise devices, or even end-user ones), but they do not
have a clear telephone signaling connection between them: Alice cannot
inject any data into signaling that Bob can read, with the exception of
the asserted destination and origination E.164 numbers. The calling
party number might originate from her own device or from the network.
These numbers are effectively the only data that can be used for
coordination between the endpoints.[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

In a more complicated setting, Alice and/or Bob may not have a smart or
programmable device, but instead just a traditional telephone. However,
one or both of them are behind a STIR-aware gateway that can participate

In such a case, Alice might have an analog (e.g., PSTN) connection to
her gateway or switch that is responsible for her identity. Similarly,
the gateway would verify Alice\'s identity, generate the right calling
party number information, and provide that number to Bob using ordinary
Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS)
mechanisms.[¶](#section-3-5){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-4 .section}
## [4.](#section-4){.section-number .selfRef} [Dataflows](#name-dataflows){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-dataflows}

Because in these operating environments, endpoints cannot pass
cryptographic information to one another directly through signaling, any
solution must involve some rendezvous mechanism to allow endpoints to
communicate. We call this rendezvous service a Call Placement Service
(CPS), a service where a record of call placement, in this case a
PASSporT, can be stored for future retrieval. In principle, this service
could communicate any information, but minimally we expect it to include
a full-form PASSporT that attests the caller, callee, and the time of
the call. The callee can use the existence of a PASSporT for a given
incoming call as rough validation of the asserted origin of that call.
(See [Section 11](#lookup){.xref} for limitations of this
design.)[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

This architecture does not mandate that any particular sort of entity
operate a CPS or mandate any means to discover a CPS. A CPS could be run
internally within a network or made publicly available. One or more
CPSes could be run by a carrier, as repositories for PASSporTs for calls
sent to its customers, or a CPS could be built into an enterprise PBX or
even a smartphone. To the degree possible, it is specified here
generically as an idea that may have applicability to a variety of STIR
deployments.[¶](#section-4-2){.pilcrow}

There are roughly two plausible dataflow architectures for the
CPS:[¶](#section-4-3){.pilcrow}

1.  [The callee registers with the CPS. When the caller wishes to place
    a call to the callee, it sends the PASSporT to the CPS, which
    immediately forwards it to the
    callee.[¶](#section-4-4.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-4-4.1}
2.  [The caller stores the PASSporT with the CPS at the time of call
    placement. When the callee receives the call, it contacts the CPS
    and retrieves the
    PASSporT.[¶](#section-4-4.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-4-4.2}

While the first architecture is roughly isomorphic to current VoIP
protocols, it shares their drawbacks. Specifically, the callee must
maintain a full-time connection to the CPS to serve as a notification
channel. This comes with the usual networking costs to the callee and is
especially problematic for mobile endpoints. Indeed, if the endpoints
had the capabilities to implement such an architecture, they could
surely just use SIP or some other protocol to set up a secure session;
even if the media were going through the traditional PSTN, a \"shadow\"
SIP session could convey the PASSporT. Thus, we focus on the second
architecture in which the PSTN incoming call serves as the notification
channel, and the callee can then contact the CPS to retrieve the
PASSporT. In specialized environments, for example, a call center that
receives a large volume of incoming calls that originated in the PSTN,
the notification channel approach might be
viable.[¶](#section-4-5){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-5 .section}
## [5.](#section-5){.section-number .selfRef} [Use Cases](#name-use-cases){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-use-cases}

The following are the motivating use cases for this mechanism. Bear in
mind that, just as in \[[RFC8224](#RFC8224){.xref}\], there may be
multiple Identity header fields in a single SIP INVITE, so there may be
multiple PASSporTs in this out-of-band mechanism associated with a
single call. For example, a SIP user agent might create a PASSporT for a
call with an end-user credential, and as the call exits the originating

A call originates in a SIP environment in a STIR-aware administrative
domain. The local authentication service for that administrative domain
creates a PASSporT that is carried in band in the call per
\[[RFC8224](#RFC8224){.xref}\]. The call is routed out of the
originating administrative domain and reaches a gateway to the PSTN.
Eventually, the call will terminate on a mobile smartphone that supports
this out-of-band mechanism.[¶](#section-5.1-1){.pilcrow}

In this use case, the originating authentication service can store the
PASSporT with the appropriate CPS (per the practices of [Section
10](#cps){.xref}) for the target telephone number as a fallback in case
SIP signaling will not reach end-to-end. When the destination mobile
smartphone receives the call over the PSTN, it consults the CPS and
discovers a PASSporT from the originating telephone number waiting for
it. It uses this PASSporT to verify the calling party
number.[¶](#section-5.1-2){.pilcrow}

A call originates with an enterprise PBX that has both Internet access
and a built-in gateway to the PSTN, which communicates through
traditional telephone signaling protocols. The PBX immediately routes
the call to the PSTN, but before it does, it provisions a PASSporT on
the CPS associated with the target telephone
number.[¶](#section-5.2-1){.pilcrow}

After normal PSTN routing, the call lands on a smart mobile handset that
supports the STIR out-of-band mechanism. It queries the appropriate CPS
over the Internet to determine if a call has been placed to it by a
STIR-aware device. It finds the PASSporT provisioned by the enterprise
PBX and uses it to verify the calling party
number.[¶](#section-5.2-2){.pilcrow}

A call originates with an enterprise PBX that has both Internet access
and a built-in gateway to the PSTN. It will immediately route the call
to the PSTN, but before it does, it provisions a PASSporT with the CPS
associated with the target telephone number. However, it turns out that
the call will eventually route through the PSTN to an Internet gateway,
which will translate this into a SIP call and deliver it to an
administrative domain with a STIR verification
service.[¶](#section-5.3-1){.pilcrow}

In this case, there are two subcases for how the PASSporT might be
retrieved. In subcase 1, the Internet gateway that receives the call
from the PSTN could query the appropriate CPS to determine if the
original caller created and provisioned a PASSporT for this call. If so,
it can retrieve the PASSporT and, when it creates a SIP INVITE for this
call, add a corresponding Identity header field per
\[[RFC8224](#RFC8224){.xref}\]. When the SIP INVITE reaches the
destination administrative domain, it will be able to verify the
PASSporT normally. Note that to avoid discrepancies with the Date header
field value, only a full-form PASSporT should be used for this purpose.
In subcase 2, the gateway does not retrieve the PASSporT itself, but
instead the verification service at the destination administrative
domain does so. Subcase 1 would perhaps be valuable for deployments
where the destination administrative domain supports in-band STIR but
not out-of-band STIR.[¶](#section-5.3-2){.pilcrow}

A call originates in the SIP world in a STIR-aware administrative
domain. The local authentication service for that administrative domain
creates a PASSporT that is carried in band in the call per
\[[RFC8224](#RFC8224){.xref}\]. The call is routed out of the
originating administrative domain and eventually reaches a gateway to
the PSTN.[¶](#section-5.4-1){.pilcrow}

In this case, the originating authentication service does not support
the out-of-band mechanism, so instead the gateway to the PSTN extracts
the PASSporT from the SIP request and provisions it to the CPS. (When
the call reaches the gateway to the PSTN, the gateway might first check
the CPS to see if a PASSporT object had already been provisioned for
this call, and only provision a PASSporT if none is
present).[¶](#section-5.4-2){.pilcrow}

Ultimately, the call may terminate on the PSTN or be routed back to a
SIP environment. In the former case, perhaps the destination endpoint
queries the CPS to retrieve the PASSporT provisioned by the first
gateway. If the call ultimately returns to a SIP environment, it might
be the gateway from the PSTN back to the Internet that retrieves the
PASSporT from the CPS and attaches it to the new SIP INVITE it creates,
or it might be the terminating administrative domain\'s verification
service that checks the CPS when an INVITE arrives with no Identity
header field. Either way, the PASSporT can survive the gap in SIP
coverage caused by the PSTN leg of the
call.[¶](#section-5.4-3){.pilcrow}

A call originates from a mobile user, and a STIR authentication service
operated by their carrier creates a PASSporT for the call. As the
carrier forwards the call via SIP, it attaches the PASSporT to the SIP
call with an Identity header field. As a fallback in case the call will
not go end-to-end over SIP, the carrier also stores the PASSporT in a
CPS.[¶](#section-5.5-1){.pilcrow}

The call is then routed over SIP for a time, before it transitions to
the PSTN and ultimately is handled by a legacy PBX at a high-volume call
center. The call center supports the out-of-band service, and has a
high-volume interface to a CPS to retrieve PASSporTs for incoming calls;
agents at the call center use a general purpose computer to manage
inbound calls and can receive STIR notifications through it. When the
PASSporT arrives at the CPS, it is sent through a
subscription/notification interface to a system that can correlate
incoming calls with valid PASSporTs. The call center agent sees that a
valid call from the originating number has
arrived.[¶](#section-5.5-2){.pilcrow}

## [6.](#section-6){.section-number .selfRef} [Storing and Retrieving PASSporTs](#name-storing-and-retrieving-pass){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-storing-and-retrieving-pass}

The use cases show a variety of entities accessing the CPS to store and
retrieve PASSporTs. The question of how the CPS authorizes the storage
and retrieval of PASSporTs is thus a key design decision in the
architecture. The STIR architecture assumes that service providers and,
in some cases, end-user devices will have credentials suitable for
attesting authority over telephone numbers per
\[[RFC8226](#RFC8226){.xref}\]. These credentials provide the most
obvious way that a CPS can authorize the storage and retrieval of
PASSporTs. However, as use cases 3, 4, and 5 in [Section
5](#uses){.xref} show, it may sometimes make sense for the entity
storing or retrieving PASSporTs to be an intermediary rather than a
device associated with either the originating or terminating side of a
call; those intermediaries often would not have access to STIR
credentials covering the telephone numbers in question. Requiring
authorization based on a credential to store PASSporTs is therefore
undesirable, though potentially acceptable if sufficient steps are taken
to mitigate any privacy risk of leaking data.[¶](#section-6-1){.pilcrow}

It is an explicit design goal of this mechanism to minimize the
potential privacy exposure of using a CPS. Ideally, the out-of-band
mechanism should not result in a worse privacy situation than in-band
STIR \[[RFC8224](#RFC8224){.xref}\]: for in-band, we might say that a
SIP entity is authorized to receive a PASSporT if it is an intermediate
or final target of the routing of a SIP request. As the originator of a
call cannot necessarily predict the routing path a call will follow, an
out-of-band mechanism could conceivably even improve on the privacy
story.[¶](#section-6-2){.pilcrow}

Broadly, the architecture recommended here thus is one focused on
permitting any entity to store encrypted PASSporTs at the CPS, indexed
under the called number. PASSporTs will be encrypted with a public key
associated with the called number, so these PASSporTs may safely be
retrieved by any entity because only holders of the corresponding
private key will be able to decrypt the PASSporT. This also prevents the
CPS itself from learning the contents of PASSporTs, and thus metadata
about calls in progress, which makes the CPS a less attractive target
for pervasive monitoring (see \[[RFC7258](#RFC7258){.xref}\]). As a
first step, transport-level security can provide confidentiality from
eavesdroppers for both the storing and retrieval of PASSporTs. To
bolster the privacy story, to prevent denial-of-service flooding of the
CPS, and to complicate traffic analysis, a few additional mechanisms are
also recommended below.[¶](#section-6-3){.pilcrow}

::: {#stor}
::: {#section-6.1 .section}
### [6.1.](#section-6.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Storage](#name-storage){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-storage}

There are a few dimensions to authorizing the storage of PASSporTs.
Encrypting PASSporTs prior to storage entails that a CPS has no way to
tell if a PASSporT is valid; it simply conveys encrypted blocks that it
cannot access itself and can make no authorization decision based on the
PASSporT contents. There is certainly no prospect for the CPS to verify
the PASSporTs itself.[¶](#section-6.1-1){.pilcrow}

Note that this architecture requires clients that store PASSporTs to
have access to an encryption key associated with the intended called
party to be used to encrypt the PASSporT. Discovering this key requires
the existence of a key lookup service (see [Section
11](#lookup){.xref}), depending on how the CPS is architected; however,
some kind of key store or repository could be implemented adjacent to it
and perhaps even incorporated into its operation. Key discovery is made
more complicated by the fact that there can potentially be multiple
entities that have authority over a telephone number: a carrier, a
reseller, an enterprise, and an end user might all have credentials
permitting them to attest that they are allowed to originate calls from
a number, say. PASSporTs for out-of-band use therefore might need to be
encrypted with multiple keys in the hopes that one will be decipherable
by the relying party.[¶](#section-6.1-2){.pilcrow}

Again, the most obvious way to authorize storage is to require the
originator to authenticate themselves to the CPS with their STIR
credential. However, since the call is indexed at the CPS under the
called number, this can weaken the privacy story of the architecture, as
it reveals to the CPS both the identity of the caller and the callee.
Moreover, it does not work for the gateway use cases described above; to
support those use cases, we must effectively allow any entity to store
PASSporTs at a CPS. This does not degrade the anti-impersonation
security of STIR, because entities who do not possess the necessary
credentials to sign the PASSporT will not be able to create PASSporTs
that will be treated as valid by verifiers. In this architecture, it
does not matter whether the CPS received a PASSporT from the
authentication service that created it or from an intermediary gateway
downstream in the routing path as in case 4 above. However, if literally
anyone can store PASSporTs in the CPS, an attacker could easily flood
the CPS with millions of bogus PASSporTs indexed under a calling number,
and thereby prevent the called party from finding a valid PASSporT for
an incoming call buried in a haystack of fake
entries.[¶](#section-6.1-3){.pilcrow}

The solution architecture must therefore include some sort of traffic
control system to prevent flooding. Preferably, this should not require
authenticating the source, as this will reveal to the CPS both the
source and destination of traffic. A potential solution is discussed
below in [Section
7.5](#rate-control){.xref}.[¶](#section-6.1-4){.pilcrow}

::: {#retr}
::: {#section-6.2 .section}
### [6.2.](#section-6.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Retrieval](#name-retrieval){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-retrieval}

For retrieval of PASSporTs, this architecture assumes that clients will
contact the CPS through some sort of polling or notification interface
to receive all current PASSporTs for calls destined to a particular
telephone number, or block of numbers.[¶](#section-6.2-1){.pilcrow}

As PASSporTs stored at the CPS are encrypted with a key belonging to the
intended destination, the CPS can safely allow anyone to download
PASSporTs for a called number without much fear of compromising private
information about calls in progress \-- provided that the CPS always
returns at least one encrypted blob in response to a request, even if
there was no call in progress. Otherwise, entities could poll the CPS
constantly, or eavesdrop on traffic, to learn whether or not calls were
in progress. The CPS [MUST]{.bcp14} generate at least one unique and
plausible encrypted response to all retrieval requests, and these dummy
encrypted PASSporTs [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be repeated for later calls. An
encryption scheme needs to be carefully chosen to make messages look
indistinguishable from random when encrypted, so that information about
the called party is not discoverable from legitimate encrypted
PASSporTs.[¶](#section-6.2-2){.pilcrow}

Because the entity placing a call may discover multiple keys associated
with the called party number, multiple valid PASSporTs may be stored in
the CPS. A particular called party who retrieves PASSporTs from the CPS
may have access to only one of those keys. Thus, the presence of one or
more PASSporTs that the called party cannot decrypt \-- which would be
indistinguishable from the \"dummy\" PASSporTs created by the CPS when
no calls are in progress - does not entail that there is no call in
progress. A retriever likely will need to decrypt all PASSporTs
retrieved from the CPS, and may find only one that is
valid.[¶](#section-6.2-3){.pilcrow}

In order to prevent the CPS from learning the numbers that a callee
controls, callees might also request PASSporTs for numbers that they do
not own, that they have no hope of decrypting. Implementations could
even allow a callee to request PASSporTs for a range or prefix of
numbers: a trade-off where that callee is willing to sift through bulk
quantities of undecryptable PASSporTs for the sake of hiding from the
CPS which numbers it controls.[¶](#section-6.2-4){.pilcrow}

Note that in out-of-band call forwarding cases, special behavior is
required to manage the relationship between PASSporTs using the
diversion extension
\[[PASSPORT-DIVERT](#I-D.ietf-stir-passport-divert){.xref}\]. The
originating authentication service encrypts the initial PASSporT with
the public encryption key of the intended destination, but once a call
is forwarded, it may go to a destination that does not possess the
corresponding private key and thus could not decrypt the original
PASSporT. This requires the retargeting entity to generate encrypted
PASSporTs that show a secure chain of diversion: a retargeting storer
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} use the \"div-o\" PASSporT type, with its \"opt\"
extension, as specified in
\[[PASSPORT-DIVERT](#I-D.ietf-stir-passport-divert){.xref}\], in order
to nest the original PASSporT within the encrypted diversion
PASSporT.[¶](#section-6.2-5){.pilcrow}

When Alice wishes to make a call to Bob, she contacts the CPS and stores
an encrypted PASSporT on the CPS indexed under Bob\'s number. The CPS
then awaits retrievals for that number.[¶](#section-7.2-3){.pilcrow}

When Alice places the call, Bob\'s phone would usually ring and display
Alice\'s number (+1.111.555.1111), which is informed by the existing
PSTN mechanisms for relaying a calling party number (e.g., the Calling
Party\'s Number (CIN) field of the Initial Address Message (IAM)).
Instead, Bob\'s phone transparently contacts the CPS and requests any
current PASSporTs for calls to his number. The CPS responds with any
such PASSporTs (or dummy PASSporTs if no relevant ones are currently
stored). If such a PASSporT exists, and the verification service in
Bob\'s phone decrypts it using his private key, validates it, then
Bob\'s phone can present the calling party number information as valid.
Otherwise, the call is unverifiable. Note that this does not necessarily
mean that the call is bogus; because we expect incremental deployment,
many legitimate calls will be unverifiable.[¶](#section-7.2-4){.pilcrow}

The primary attack we seek to prevent is an attacker convincing the

1.  [The attacker wishes to impersonate a target when no call from that

2.  [The attacker wishes to substitute himself for an existing call
    setup.[¶](#section-7.3-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-7.3-2.2}

If an attacker can inject fake PASSporTs into the CPS or in the
communication from the CPS to the callee, he can mount either attack. As
PASSporTs should be digitally signed by an appropriate authority for the
number and verified by the callee (see [Section 7.1](#phone){.xref}),
this should not arise in ordinary operations. Any attacker who is aware
of calls in progress can attempt to mount a race to substitute
themselves as described in [Section 7.4](#sub){.xref}. For privacy and
robustness reasons, using [TLS](#RFC8446){.xref}
\[[RFC8446](#RFC8446){.xref}\] on the originating side when storing the
PASSporT at the CPS is
[RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14}.[¶](#section-7.3-3){.pilcrow}

The entire system depends on the security of the credential
infrastructure. If the authentication credentials for a given number are
compromised, then an attacker can impersonate calls from that number.
However, that is no different from in-band STIR
\[[RFC8224](#RFC8224){.xref}\].[¶](#section-7.3-4){.pilcrow}

All that the receipt of the PASSporT from the CPS proves to the called

from Alice. Consider the scenario in which we have a service that
provides an automatic callback to a user-provided number. In that case,
the attacker can try to arrange for a false caller-id value, as shown

[¶](#section-7.4-2){.pilcrow}
:::

In order to mount this attack, the attacker contacts the Callback
Service (CS) and provides it with Bob\'s number. This causes the CS to
initiate a call to Bob. As before, the CS contacts the CPS to insert an
appropriate PASSporT and then initiates a call to Bob. Because it is a
valid CS injecting the PASSporT, none of the security checks mentioned
above help. However, the attacker simultaneously initiates a call to Bob
using forged caller-id information corresponding to the CS. If he wins
the race with the CS, then Bob\'s phone will attempt to verify the
attacker\'s call (and succeed since they are indistinguishable), and the
CS\'s call will go to busy/voice mail/call
waiting.[¶](#section-7.4-3){.pilcrow}

In order to prevent a passive attacker from using traffic analysis or
similar means to learn precisely when a call is placed, it is essential
that the connection between the caller and the CPS be encrypted as
recommended above. Authentication services could store dummy PASSporTs
at the CPS at random intervals in order to make it more difficult for an
eavesdropper to use traffic analysis to determine that a call was about
to be placed.[¶](#section-7.4-4){.pilcrow}

Note that in a SIP environment, the callee might notice that there were
multiple INVITEs and thus detect this attack, but in some PSTN
interworking scenarios, or highly intermediated networks, only one call
setup attempt will reach the target. Also note that the success of this
substitution attack depends on the attacker landing their call within
the narrow window that the PASSporT is retained in the CPS, so
shortening that window will reduce the opportunity for the attack.
Finally, smart endpoints could implement some sort of state coordination
to ensure that both sides believe the call is in progress, though
methods of supporting that are outside the scope of this

In order to prevent the flooding of a CPS with bogus PASSporTs, we
propose the use of \"blind signatures\" (see
\[[RFC5636](#RFC5636){.xref}\]). A sender will initially authenticate to
the CPS using its STIR credentials and acquire a signed token from the
CPS that will be presented later when storing a PASSporT. The flow looks

connects to the CPS, authenticates, and sends a blinded version of a

blinded key. The sender can then unblind the key and get a signature on
K_temp from the CPS.[¶](#section-7.5-3){.pilcrow}

Then later, when a client wants to store a PASSporT, it connects to the
CPS anonymously (preferably over a network connection that cannot be
correlated with the token acquisition) and sends both the signed K_temp
and its own signature over the encrypted PASSporT. The CPS verifies both
signatures and, if they verify, stores the encrypted passport
(discarding the signatures).[¶](#section-7.5-4){.pilcrow}

This design lets the CPS rate limit how many PASSporTs a given sender
can store just by counting how many times K_temp appears; perhaps CPS
policy might reject storage attempts and require acquisition of a new
K_temp after storing more than a certain number of PASSporTs indexed
under the same destination number in a short interval. This does not, of
course, allow the CPS to tell when bogus data is being provisioned by an
attacker, simply the rate at which data is being provisioned.
Potentially, feedback mechanisms could be developed that would allow the
called parties to tell the CPS when they are receiving unusual or bogus
PASSporTs.[¶](#section-7.5-5){.pilcrow}

This architecture also assumes that the CPS will age out PASSporTs. A
CPS [SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} keep any stored PASSporT for longer than the
recommended freshness policy for the \"iat\" value as described in
\[[RFC8224](#RFC8224){.xref}\] (i.e., sixty seconds) unless some local
policy for a CPS deployment requires a longer or shorter interval. Any
reduction in this window makes substitution attacks (see [Section
7.4](#sub){.xref}) harder to mount, but making the window too small
might conceivably age PASSporTs out while a heavily redirected call is
still alerting.[¶](#section-7.5-6){.pilcrow}

An alternative potential approach to blind signatures would be the use
of verifiable oblivious pseudorandom functions (VOPRFs, per
\[[PRIVACY-PASS](#I-D.privacy-pass){.xref}\]), which may prove
faster.[¶](#section-7.5-7){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC8224](#RFC8224){.xref}\] defines an authentication service and a
verification service as functions that act in the context of SIP
requests and responses. This specification thus provides a more generic
description of authentication service and verification service behavior
that might or might not involve any SIP transactions, but depends only
on placing a request for communications from an originating identity to
one or more destination identities.[¶](#section-8-1){.pilcrow}

### [8.1.](#section-8.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Authentication Service (AS)](#name-authentication-service-as){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-authentication-service-as}

Out-of-band authentication services perform steps similar to those
defined in \[[RFC8224](#RFC8224){.xref}\] with some
exceptions:[¶](#section-8.1-1){.pilcrow}

Step 1: The authentication service [MUST]{.bcp14} determine whether it
is authoritative for the identity of the originator of the request, that
is, the identity it will populate in the \"orig\" claim of the PASSporT.
It can do so only if it possesses the private key of one or more
credentials that can be used to sign for that identity, be it a domain
or a telephone number or some other identifier. For example, the
authentication service could hold the private key associated with a
[STIR certificate](#RFC8225){.xref}
\[[RFC8225](#RFC8225){.xref}\].[¶](#section-8.1-2){.pilcrow}

Step 2: The authentication service [MUST]{.bcp14} determine that the
originator of communications can claim the originating identity. This is
a policy decision made by the authentication service that depends on its
relationship to the originator. For an out-of-band application built
into the calling device, for example, this is the same check performed
in Step 1: does the calling device hold a private key, one corresponding
to a STIR certificate, that can sign for the originating
identity?[¶](#section-8.1-3){.pilcrow}

::: {#as-step3}
Step 3: The authentication service [MUST]{.bcp14} acquire the public
encryption key of the destination, which will be used to encrypt the
PASSporT (see [Section 11](#lookup){.xref}). It [MUST]{.bcp14} also
discover (see [Section 10](#cps){.xref}) the CPS associated with the
destination. The authentication service may already have the encryption
key and destination CPS cached, or may need to query a service to
acquire the key. Note that per [Section 7.5](#rate-control){.xref}, the
authentication service may also need to acquire a token for PASSporT
storage from the CPS upon CPS discovery. It is anticipated that the
discovery mechanism (see [Section 10](#cps){.xref}) used to find the
appropriate CPS will also find the proper key server for the public key
of the destination. In some cases, a destination may have multiple
public encryption keys associated with it. In that case, the
authentication service [MUST]{.bcp14} collect all of those
keys.[¶](#section-8.1-4){.pilcrow}
:::

Step 4: The authentication service [MUST]{.bcp14} create the PASSporT
object. This includes acquiring the system time to populate the \"iat\"
claim, and populating the \"orig\" and \"dest\" claims as described in
\[[RFC8225](#RFC8225){.xref}\]. The authentication service
[MUST]{.bcp14} then encrypt the PASSporT. If in Step 3 the
authentication service discovered multiple public keys for the
destination, it [MUST]{.bcp14} create one encrypted copy for each public
key it discovered.[¶](#section-8.1-5){.pilcrow}

Finally, the authentication service stores the encrypted PASSporT(s) at
the CPS discovered in Step 3. Only after that is completed should any
call be initiated. Note that a call might be initiated over SIP, and the
authentication service would place the same PASSporT in the Identity
header field value of the SIP request \-- though SIP would carry a
cleartext version rather than an encrypted version sent to the CPS. In
that case, out-of-band would serve as a fallback mechanism if the
request was not conveyed over SIP end-to-end. Also, note that the
authentication service [MAY]{.bcp14} use a compact form of the PASSporT
for a SIP request, whereas the version stored at the CPS [MUST]{.bcp14}
always be a full-form PASSporT.[¶](#section-8.1-6){.pilcrow}

When a call arrives, an out-of-band verification service performs steps
similar to those defined in \[[RFC8224](#RFC8224){.xref}\] with some
exceptions:[¶](#section-8.2-1){.pilcrow}

::: {#vs-step1}
Step 1: The verification service contacts the CPS and requests all
current PASSporTs for its destination number; or alternatively it may
receive PASSporTs through a push interface from the CPS in some
deployments. The verification service [MUST]{.bcp14} then decrypt all
PASSporTs using its private key. Some PASSporTs may not be decryptable
for any number of reasons: they may be intended for a different
verification service, or they may be \"dummy\" values inserted by the
CPS for privacy purposes. The next few steps will narrow down the set of
PASSporTs that the verification service will examine from that initial
decryptable set.[¶](#section-8.2-2){.pilcrow}
:::

Step 2: The verification service [MUST]{.bcp14} determine if any \"ppt\"
extensions in the PASSporTs are unsupported. It takes only the set of
supported PASSporTs and applies the next step to
them.[¶](#section-8.2-3){.pilcrow}

Step 3: The verification service [MUST]{.bcp14} determine if there is an
overlap between the calling party number presented in call signaling and
the \"orig\" field of any decrypted PASSporTs. It takes the set of
matching PASSporTs and applies the next step to
them.[¶](#section-8.2-4){.pilcrow}

Step 4: The verification service [MUST]{.bcp14} determine if the
credentials that signed each PASSporT are valid, and if the verification
service trusts the CA that issued the credentials. It takes the set of
trusted PASSporTs to the next step.[¶](#section-8.2-5){.pilcrow}

Step 5: The verification service [MUST]{.bcp14} check the freshness of
the \"iat\" claim of each PASSporT. The exact interval of time that
determines freshness is left to local policy. It takes the set of fresh
PASSporTs to the next step.[¶](#section-8.2-6){.pilcrow}

Step 6: The verification service [MUST]{.bcp14} check the validity of
the signature over each PASSporT, as described in
\[[RFC8225](#RFC8225){.xref}\].[¶](#section-8.2-7){.pilcrow}

Finally, the verification service will end up with one or more valid
PASSporTs corresponding to the call it has received. In keeping with
baseline STIR, this document does not dictate any particular treatment
of calls that have valid PASSporTs associated with them; the handling of
the call after the verification process depends on how the verification
service is implemented and on local policy. However, it is anticipated
that local policies could involve making different forwarding decisions
in intermediary implementations, or changing how the user is alerted or
how identity is rendered in user agent
implementations.[¶](#section-8.2-8){.pilcrow}

### [8.3.](#section-8.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Gateway Placement Services](#name-gateway-placement-services){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-gateway-placement-services}

The STIR out-of-band mechanism also supports the presence of gateway
placement services, which do not create PASSporTs themselves, but
instead take PASSporTs out of signaling protocols and store them at a
CPS before gatewaying to a protocol that cannot carry PASSporTs itself.
For example, a SIP gateway that sends calls to the PSTN could receive a
call with an Identity header field, extract a PASSporT from the Identity
header field, and store that PASSporT at a
CPS.[¶](#section-8.3-1){.pilcrow}

To place a PASSporT at a CPS, a gateway [MUST]{.bcp14} perform [Step
3](#as-step3){.xref} of [Section 8.1](#as){.xref} above: that is, it
must discover the CPS and public key associated with the destination of
the call, and may need to acquire a PASSporT storage token (see [Section
6.1](#stor){.xref}). Per [Step 3](#as-step3){.xref} of [Section
8.1](#as){.xref}, this may entail discovering several keys. The gateway
then collects the in-band PASSporT(s) from the in-band signaling,
encrypts the PASSporT(s), and stores them at the
CPS.[¶](#section-8.3-2){.pilcrow}

A similar service could be performed by a gateway that retrieves
PASSporTs from a CPS and inserts them into signaling protocols that
support carrying PASSporTs in-band. This behavior may be defined by
future specifications.[¶](#section-8.3-3){.pilcrow}

## [10.](#section-10){.section-number .selfRef} [CPS Discovery](#name-cps-discovery){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-cps-discovery}

In order for the two ends of the out-of-band dataflow to coordinate,
they must agree on a way to discover a CPS and retrieve PASSporT objects
from it based solely on the rendezvous information available: the
calling party number and the called number. Because the storage of
PASSporTs in this architecture is indexed by the called party number, it
makes sense to discover a CPS based on the called party number as well.
There are a number of potential service discovery mechanisms that could
be used for this purpose. The means of service discovery may vary by use
case.[¶](#section-10-1){.pilcrow}

Although the discussion above is written largely in terms of a single
CPS, having a significant fraction of all telephone calls result in
storing and retrieving PASSporTs at a single monolithic CPS has obvious
scaling problems, and would as well allow the CPS to gather metadata
about a very wide set of callers and callees. These issues can be
alleviated by operational models with a federated CPS; any service
discovery mechanism for out-of-band STIR should enable federation of the
CPS function. Likely models include ones where a carrier operates one or
more CPS instances on behalf of its customers, an enterprise runs a CPS
instance on behalf of its PBX users, or a third-party service provider
offers a CPS as a cloud service.[¶](#section-10-2){.pilcrow}

Some service discovery possibilities under consideration include the
following:[¶](#section-10-3){.pilcrow}

-   [For some deployments in closed (e.g., intra-network) environments,
    the CPS location can simply be provisioned in implementations,
    obviating the need for a discovery
    protocol.[¶](#section-10-4.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-10-4.1}
-   [If a credential lookup service is already available (see [Section
    11](#lookup){.xref}), the CPS location can also be recorded in the
    callee\'s credentials; an extension to
    \[[RFC8226](#RFC8226){.xref}\] could, for example, provide a link to
    the location of the CPS where PASSporTs should be stored for a
    destination.[¶](#section-10-4.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-10-4.2}
-   [There exist a number of common directory systems that might be used

    implemented, though no \"golden root\" central ENUM administration
    exists that could be easily reused today to help the endpoints
    discover a common CPS. Other protocols associated with queries for
    telephone numbers, such as the [Telephone-Related Information (TeRI)
    protocol](#I-D.ietf-modern-teri){.xref}
    \[[MODERN-TERI](#I-D.ietf-modern-teri){.xref}\], could also serve
    for this
    application.[¶](#section-10-4.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-10-4.3}
-   [Another possibility is to use a single distributed service for this

    \[[RFC6940](#RFC6940){.xref}\] usage for telephone numbers to help
    direct calls to enterprises on the Internet. It would be possible to
    describe a similar RELOAD usage to identify the CPS where calls for
    a particular telephone number should be stored. One advantage that
    the STIR architecture has over VIPR is that it assumes a credential
    system that proves authority over telephone numbers; those
    credentials could be used to determine whether or not a CPS could
    legitimately claim to be the proper store for a given telephone
    number.[¶](#section-10-4.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-10-4.4}

This document does not prescribe any single way to do service discovery
for a CPS; it is envisioned that initial deployments will provision the
location of the CPS at the authentication service and verification
service.[¶](#section-10-5){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-11 .section}
## [11.](#section-11){.section-number .selfRef} [Encryption Key Lookup](#name-encryption-key-lookup){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-encryption-key-lookup}

In order to encrypt a PASSporT (see [Section 6.1](#stor){.xref}), the
caller needs access to the callee\'s public encryption key. Note that
because STIR uses the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)
for signing PASSporTs, the public key used to verify PASSporTs is not
suitable for this function, and thus the encryption key must be
discovered separately. This requires some sort of directory/lookup
system.[¶](#section-11-1){.pilcrow}

Some initial STIR deployments have fielded certificate repositories so
that verification services can acquire the signing credentials for
PASSporTs, which are linked through a URI in the \"x5u\" element of the
PASSporT. These certificate repositories could clearly be repurposed for
allowing authentication services to download the public encryption key
for the called party \-- provided they can be discovered by calling
parties. This document does not specify any particular discovery scheme,
but instead offers some general guidance about potential
approaches.[¶](#section-11-2){.pilcrow}

It is a desirable property that the public encryption key for a given
party be linked to their STIR credential. An [Elliptic Curve
Diffie-Hellman (ECDH)](#RFC7748){.xref} \[[RFC7748](#RFC7748){.xref}\]
public-private key pair might be generated for a
[subcert](#I-D.ietf-tls-subcerts){.xref}
\[[TLS-SUBCERTS](#I-D.ietf-tls-subcerts){.xref}\] of the STIR
credential. That subcert could be looked up along with the STIR
credential of the called party. Further details of this subcert, and the
exact lookup mechanism involved, are deferred for future protocol
work.[¶](#section-11-3){.pilcrow}

Obviously, if there is a single central database that the caller and
callee each access in real time to download the other\'s keys, then this
represents a real privacy risk, as the central key database learns about
each call. A number of mechanisms are potentially available to mitigate
this:[¶](#section-11-4){.pilcrow}

-   [Have endpoints pre-fetch keys for potential counterparties (e.g.,
    their address book or the entire
    database).[¶](#section-11-5.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-11-5.1}
-   [Have caching servers in the user\'s network that proxy their
    fetches and thus conceal the relationship between the user and the
    keys they are
    fetching.[¶](#section-11-5.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-11-5.2}

Clearly, there is a privacy/timeliness trade-off in that getting
up-to-date knowledge about credential validity requires contacting the
credential directory in real-time (e.g., via the [Online Certificate
Status Protocol (OCSP)](#RFC6960){.xref}
\[[RFC6960](#RFC6960){.xref}\]). This is somewhat mitigated for the
caller\'s credentials in that he can get short-term credentials right
before placing a call which only reveals his calling rate, but not who
he is calling. Alternately, the CPS can verify the caller\'s credentials
via OCSP, though of course this requires the callee to trust the CPS\'s
verification. This approach does not work as well for the callee\'s
credentials, but the risk there is more modest since an attacker would
need to both have the callee\'s credentials and regularly poll the
database for every potential caller.[¶](#section-11-6){.pilcrow}

We consider the exact best point in the trade-off space to be an open
issue.[¶](#section-11-7){.pilcrow}

Delivering PASSporTs out-of-band offers a different set of privacy
properties than traditional in-band STIR. In-band operations convey
PASSporTs as headers in SIP messages in cleartext, which any forwarding
intermediaries can potentially inspect. By contrast, out-of-band STIR
stores these PASSporTs at a service after encrypting them as described
in [Section 6](#authz){.xref}, effectively creating a path between the
authentication and verification service in which the CPS is the sole
intermediary, but the CPS cannot read the PASSporTs. Potentially,
out-of-band PASSporT delivery could thus improve on the privacy story of
STIR.[¶](#section-13-1){.pilcrow}

The principle actors in the operation of out-of-band are the AS, VS, and
CPS. The AS and VS functions differ from baseline behavior
\[[RFC8224](#RFC8224){.xref}\], in that they interact with a CPS over a
non-SIP interface, of which the REST interface in [Section
9](#web){.xref} serves as an example. Some out-of-band deployments may
also require a discovery service for the CPS itself ([Section
10](#cps){.xref}) and/or encryption keys ([Section 11](#lookup){.xref}).
Even with encrypted PASSporTs, the network interactions by which the AS
and VS interact with the CPS, and to a lesser extent any discovery
services, thus create potential opportunities for data leakage about
calling and called parties.[¶](#section-13-2){.pilcrow}

The process of storing and retrieving PASSporTs at a CPS can itself
reveal information about calls being placed. The mechanism takes care
not to require that the AS authenticate itself to the CPS, relying
instead on a blind signature mechanism for flood control prevention.
[Section 7.4](#sub){.xref} discusses the practice of storing \"dummy\"
PASSporTs at random intervals to thwart traffic analysis, and as
[Section 8.2](#vs){.xref} notes, a CPS is required to return a dummy
PASSporT even if there is no PASSporT indexed for that calling number,
which similarly enables the retrieval side to randomly request PASSporTs
when there are no calls in progress. Note that the caller\'s IP address
itself leaks information about the caller. Proxying the storage of the
CPS through some third party could help prevent this attack. It might
also be possible to use a more sophisticated system such as Riposte
\[[RIPOSTE](#RIPOSTE){.xref}\]. These measures can help to mitigate
information disclosure in the system. In implementations that require
service discovery (see [Section 10](#cps){.xref}), perhaps through key
discovery ([Section 11](#lookup){.xref}), similar measures could be used
to make sure that service discovery does not itself disclose information
about calls.[¶](#section-13-3){.pilcrow}

Ultimately, this document only provides a framework for future
implementation of out-of-band systems, and the privacy properties of a
given implementation will depend on architectural assumptions made in
those environments. More closed systems for intranet operations may
adopt a weaker security posture but otherwise mitigate the risks of
information disclosure, whereas more open environments will require
careful implementation of the practices described
here.[¶](#section-13-4){.pilcrow}

For general privacy risks associated with the operations of STIR, also
see the privacy considerations covered in [Section
11](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8224#section-11){.relref} of
\[[RFC8224](#RFC8224){.xref}\].[¶](#section-13-5){.pilcrow}

## [14.](#section-14){.section-number .selfRef} [Security Considerations](#name-security-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-security-considerations}

This entire document is about security, but the detailed security
properties will vary depending on how the framework is applied and
deployed. General guidance for dealing with the most obvious security
challenges posed by this framework is given in Sections
[7.3](#sec){.xref} and [7.4](#sub){.xref}, along proposed solutions for
problems like denial-of-service attacks or traffic analysis against the
CPS.[¶](#section-14-1){.pilcrow}

Although there are considerable security challenges associated with
widespread deployment of a public CPS, those must be weighed against the
potential usefulness of a service that delivers a STIR assurance without
requiring the passage of end-to-end SIP. Ultimately, the security
properties of this mechanism are at least comparable to in-band STIR:
the substitution attack documented in [Section 7.4](#sub){.xref} could
be implemented by any in-band SIP intermediary or eavesdropper who
happened to see the PASSporT in transit, say, and launched its own call
with a copy of that PASSporT to race against the original to the
destination.[¶](#section-14-2){.pilcrow}
