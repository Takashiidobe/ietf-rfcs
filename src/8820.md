# RFC 8820 {#rfcnum}

# URI Design and Ownership {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

Section 1.1.1 of RFC 3986 defines URI syntax as \"a federated and
extensible naming system wherein each scheme\'s specification may
further restrict the syntax and semantics of identifiers using that
scheme.\" In other words, the structure of a URI is defined by its
scheme. While it is common for schemes to further delegate their
substructure to the URI\'s owner, publishing independent standards that
mandate particular forms of substructure in URIs is often
problematic.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

This document provides guidance on the specification of URI substructure
in standards.[¶](#section-abstract-2){.pilcrow}

URIs \[[RFC3986](#RFC3986){.xref}\] very often include structured
application data. This might include artifacts from filesystems (often
occurring in the path component) and user information (often in the
query component). In some cases, there can even be application-specific
data in the authority component (e.g., some applications are spread
across several hostnames to enable a form of partitioning or
dispatch).[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

Implementations can impose further constraints upon the structure of
URIs; for example, many web servers use the filename extension of the
last path segment to determine the media type of the response. Likewise,
prepackaged applications often have highly structured URIs that can only
be changed in limited ways (often, just the hostname and port on which
they are deployed).[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

Because the owner of the URI (as defined in
\[[webarch](#webarch){.xref}\], Section 2.2.2.1) is choosing to use the
server or the application, this can be seen as reasonable delegation of
authority. However, when such conventions are mandated by a party other
than the owner, it can have several potentially detrimental
effects:[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

-   [Collisions - As more ad hoc conventions for URI structure become
    standardized, it becomes more likely that there will be collisions
    between them (especially considering that servers, applications, and
    individual deployments will have their own
    conventions).[¶](#section-1-4.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-4.1}
-   [Dilution - When the information added to a URI is ephemeral, this
    dilutes its utility by reducing its stability (see
    \[[webarch](#webarch){.xref}\], Section 3.5.1) and can cause several
    alternate forms of the URI to exist (see
    \[[webarch](#webarch){.xref}\], Section
    2.3.1).[¶](#section-1-4.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-4.2}
-   [Rigidity - Fixed URI syntax often interferes with desired
    deployment patterns. For example, if an authority wishes to offer
    several applications on a single hostname, it becomes difficult to
    impossible to do if their URIs do not allow the required
    flexibility.[¶](#section-1-4.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-4.3}
-   [Operational Difficulty - Supporting some URI conventions can be
    difficult in some implementations. For example, specifying that a
    particular query parameter be used with \"http\" URIs can preclude
    the use of web servers that serve the response from a filesystem.
    Likewise, an application that fixes a base path for its operation
    (e.g., \"/v1\") makes it impossible to deploy other applications
    with the same prefix on the same
    host.[¶](#section-1-4.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-4.4}
-   [Client Assumptions - When conventions are standardized, some
    clients will inevitably assume that the standards are in use when
    those conventions are seen. This can lead to interoperability
    problems; for example, if a specification documents that the \"sig\"
    URI query parameter indicates that its payload is a cryptographic
    signature for the URI, it can lead to undesirable
    behavior.[¶](#section-1-4.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-4.5}

Publishing a standard that constrains an existing URI structure in ways
that aren\'t explicitly allowed by \[[RFC3986](#RFC3986){.xref}\]
(usually, by updating the URI scheme definition) is therefore sometimes
problematic, both for these reasons and because the structure of a URI
needs to be firmly under the control of its
owner.[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}

This document explains some best current practices for establishing URI
structures, conventions, and formats in standards. It also offers
strategies for specifications in [Section
3](#alternatives){.xref}.[¶](#section-1-6){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-1.1 .section}
### [1.1.](#section-1.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Intended Audience](#name-intended-audience){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-intended-audience}

This document\'s guidelines and requirements target the authors of
specifications that constrain the syntax or structure of URIs or parts
of them. Two classes of such specifications are called out
specifically:[¶](#section-1.1-1){.pilcrow}

-   [Protocol Extensions (\"Extensions\") - specifications that offer
    new capabilities that could apply to any identifier or to a large
    subset of possible identifiers, e.g., a new signature mechanism for
    \"http\" URIs, metadata for any URI, or a new
    format.[¶](#section-1.1-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-1.1-2.1}
-   [Applications Using URIs (\"Applications\") - specifications that
    use URIs to meet specific needs, e.g., an HTTP interface to
    particular information on a
    host.[¶](#section-1.1-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-1.1-2.2}

Requirements that target the generic class \"Specifications\" apply to
all specifications, including both those enumerated above and
others.[¶](#section-1.1-3){.pilcrow}

Note that this specification ought not be interpreted as preventing the
allocation of control of URIs by parties that legitimately own them or
have delegated that ownership; for example, a specification might
legitimately define the semantics of a URI on IANA\'s web site as part
of the establishment of a registry.[¶](#section-1.1-4){.pilcrow}

There may be existing IETF specifications that already deviate from the
guidance in this document. In these cases, it is up to the relevant
communities (i.e., those of the URI scheme as well as any relevant
community that produced the specification in question) to determine an
appropriate outcome, e.g., updating the scheme definition or changing
the specification.[¶](#section-1.1-5){.pilcrow}

This section updates \[[RFC3986](#RFC3986){.xref}\] by advising
Specifications how they should define structure and semantics within
URIs. Best practices differ, depending on the URI component in question,
as described below.[¶](#section-2-1){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-2.1 .section}
### [2.1.](#section-2.1){.section-number .selfRef} [URI Schemes](#name-uri-schemes){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-uri-schemes}

Applications and Extensions can require the use of one or more specific
URI schemes; for example, it is perfectly acceptable to require that an
Application support \"http\" and \"https\" URIs. However, Applications
ought not preclude the use of other URI schemes in the future, unless
they are clearly only usable with the nominated
schemes.[¶](#section-2.1-1){.pilcrow}

A Specification that defines substructure for URI schemes overall (e.g.,
a prefix or suffix for URI scheme names) [MUST]{.bcp14} do so by
modifying \[[BCP35](#BCP35){.xref}\] (an exceptional
circumstance).[¶](#section-2.1-2){.pilcrow}
:::

::: {#uri-authorities}
::: {#section-2.2 .section}
### [2.2.](#section-2.2){.section-number .selfRef} [URI Authorities](#name-uri-authorities){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-uri-authorities}

Scheme definitions define the presence, format, and semantics of an
authority component in URIs; all other Specifications [MUST NOT]{.bcp14}
constrain or define the structure or the semantics for URI authorities,
unless they update the scheme registration itself or the structures it
relies upon (e.g., DNS name syntax, as defined in [Section
3.5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1034#section-3.5){.relref} of
\[[RFC1034](#RFC1034){.xref}\]).[¶](#section-2.2-1){.pilcrow}

For example, an Extension or Application cannot say that the \"foo\"
prefix in \"https://foo_app.example.com\" is meaningful or triggers
special handling in URIs, unless they update either the \"http\" URI
scheme or the DNS hostname syntax.[¶](#section-2.2-2){.pilcrow}

Applications can nominate or constrain the port they use, when
applicable. For example, BarApp could run over port nnnn (provided that
it is properly registered).[¶](#section-2.2-3){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-2.3 .section}
### [2.3.](#section-2.3){.section-number .selfRef} [URI Paths](#name-uri-paths){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-uri-paths}

Scheme definitions define the presence, format, and semantics of a path
component in URIs, although these are often delegated to the
Application(s) in a given deployment.[¶](#section-2.3-1){.pilcrow}

To avoid collisions, rigidity, and erroneous client assumptions,
Specifications [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} define a fixed prefix for their URI
paths \-- for example, \"/myapp\" \-- unless allowed by the scheme
definition.[¶](#section-2.3-2){.pilcrow}

One such exception to this requirement is registered \"well-known\"
URIs, as specified by \[[RFC8615](#RFC8615){.xref}\]. See that document
for a description of the applicability of that
mechanism.[¶](#section-2.3-3){.pilcrow}

Note that this does not apply to Applications defining a structure of a
URI\'s path \"under\" a resource controlled by the server. Because the
prefix is under control of the party deploying the Application,
collisions and rigidity are avoided, and the risk of erroneous client
assumptions is reduced.[¶](#section-2.3-4){.pilcrow}

For example, an Application might define \"app_root\" as a
deployment-controlled URI prefix. Application-defined resources might
then be assumed to be present at \"{app_root}/foo\" and
\"{app_root}/bar\".[¶](#section-2.3-5){.pilcrow}

Extensions [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} define a structure within individual URI
components (e.g., a prefix or suffix), again to avoid collisions and
erroneous client assumptions.[¶](#section-2.3-6){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-2.4 .section}
### [2.4.](#section-2.4){.section-number .selfRef} [URI Queries](#name-uri-queries){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-uri-queries}

The presence, format, and semantics of the query component of URIs are
dependent upon many factors and can be constrained by a scheme
definition. Often, they are determined by the implementation of a
resource itself.[¶](#section-2.4-1){.pilcrow}

Applications can specify the syntax of queries for the resources under
their control. However, doing so can cause operational difficulties for
deployments that do not support a particular form of a query. For
example, a site may wish to support an Application using \"static\"
files that do not support query parameters.[¶](#section-2.4-2){.pilcrow}

Extensions [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} constrain the format or semantics of
queries, to avoid collisions and erroneous client assumptions. For
example, an Extension that indicates that all query parameters with the
name \"sig\" indicate a cryptographic signature would collide with
potentially preexisting query parameters on sites and lead clients to
assume that any matching query parameter is a
signature.[¶](#section-2.4-3){.pilcrow}

Per the \"Form submission\" section of \[[HTML5](#HTML5){.xref}\], HTML
constrains the syntax of query strings used in form submission. New form
languages are encouraged to allow creation of a broader variety of URIs
(e.g., by allowing the form to create new path components, and so
forth).[¶](#section-2.4-4){.pilcrow}

### [2.5.](#section-2.5){.section-number .selfRef} [URI Fragment Identifiers](#name-uri-fragment-identifiers){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-uri-fragment-identifiers}

[Section
3.5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986#section-3.5){.relref} of
\[[RFC3986](#RFC3986){.xref}\] specifies fragment identifiers\' syntax
and semantics as being dependent upon the media type of a potentially
retrieved resource. As a result, other Specifications [MUST NOT]{.bcp14}
define structure within the fragment identifier, unless they are
explicitly defining one for reuse by media types in their definitions
(for example, as JSON Pointer \[[RFC6901](#RFC6901){.xref}\]
does).[¶](#section-2.5-1){.pilcrow}

An Application that defines common fragment identifiers across media
types not controlled by it would engender interoperability problems with
handlers for those media types (because the new, non-standard syntax is
not expected).[¶](#section-2.5-2){.pilcrow}

## [3.](#section-3){.section-number .selfRef} [Alternatives to Specifying Structure in URIs](#name-alternatives-to-specifying-){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-alternatives-to-specifying-}

Given the issues described in [Section 1](#intro){.xref}, the most
successful strategy for Applications and Extensions that wish to use
URIs is to use them in the fashion for which they were designed: as
links that are exchanged as part of the protocol, rather than statically
specified syntax. Several existing specifications can aid in
this.[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC8288](#RFC8288){.xref}\] specifies relation types for web links.
By providing a framework for linking on the Web, where every link has a
relation type, context, and target, it allows Applications to define a
link\'s semantics and connectivity.[¶](#section-3-2){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC6570](#RFC6570){.xref}\] provides a standard syntax for URI
Templates that can be used to dynamically insert Application-specific
variables into a URI to enable such Applications while avoiding
impinging upon URI owners\' control of them.[¶](#section-3-3){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC8615](#RFC8615){.xref}\] allows specific paths to be \"reserved\"
for standard use on URI schemes that opt into that mechanism (\"http\"
and \"https\" by default). Note, however, that this is not a general
\"escape valve\" for Applications that need structured URIs; see that
specification for more information.[¶](#section-3-4){.pilcrow}

Specifying more elaborate structures in an attempt to avoid collisions
is not an acceptable solution and does not address the issues described
in [Section 1](#intro){.xref}. For example, prefixing query parameters
with \"myapp\_\" does not help, because the prefix itself is subject to
the risk of collision (since it is not
\"reserved\").[¶](#section-3-5){.pilcrow}

that already use the chosen string). See also
