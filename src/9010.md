# RFC 9010 {#rfcnum}

# Routing for RPL (Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks) Leaves {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

This specification provides a mechanism for a host that implements a
routing-agnostic interface based on IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless
Personal Area Network (6LoWPAN) Neighbor Discovery to obtain
reachability services across a network that leverages RFC 6550 for its
routing operations. It updates RFCs 6550, 6775, and
8505.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

The design of Low-Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) is generally focused
on saving energy, which is the most constrained resource of all. Other
design constraints, such as a limited memory capacity, duty cycling of
the LLN devices, and low-power lossy transmissions, derive from that
primary concern.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

The IETF produced \"[RPL: IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy
Networks](#RFC6550){.xref}\" \[[RFC6550](#RFC6550){.xref}\] to provide
routing services for IPv6 \[[RFC8200](#RFC8200){.xref}\] within such
constraints. RPL belongs to the class of distance-vector protocols \--
which, compared to link-state protocols, limit the amount of topological
knowledge that needs to be installed and maintained in each node \-- and
does not require convergence to avoid
micro-loops.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

To save signaling and routing state in constrained networks, RPL allows
a path stretch (see \[[RFC6687](#RFC6687){.xref}\]), whereby routing is
only performed along a Destination-Oriented Directed Acyclic Graph
(DODAG) that is optimized to reach a root node, as opposed to along the
shortest path between two peers, whatever that would mean in a given
LLN. This trades the quality of peer-to-peer (P2P) paths for a vastly
reduced amount of control traffic and routing state that would be
required to operate an any-to-any shortest-path protocol. Additionally,
broken routes may be fixed lazily and on demand, based on data-plane
inconsistency discovery, which avoids wasting energy in the proactive
repair of unused paths.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

For many of the nodes, though not all, the DODAG provides multiple
forwarding solutions towards the root of the topology via so-called
parents. RPL installs the routes proactively, but to adapt to fuzzy
connectivity \-- whereby the physical topology cannot be expected to
reach a stable state \-- it uses a lazy route maintenance operation that
may only fix them reactively, upon actual traffic. The result is that
RPL provides reachability for most of the LLN nodes, most of the time,
but may not converge in the classical sense.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

RPL can be deployed in conjunction with IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND)
\[[RFC4861](#RFC4861){.xref}\] \[[RFC4862](#RFC4862){.xref}\] and IPv6
over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Network (6LoWPAN) ND
\[[RFC6775](#RFC6775){.xref}\] \[[RFC8505](#RFC8505){.xref}\] to
maintain reachability within a Non-Broadcast Multi-Access (NBMA)
multi-link subnet.[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}

In that mode, IPv6 addresses are advertised individually as host routes.
Some nodes may act as routers and participate in the forwarding
operations, whereas others will only receive/originate packets, acting
as hosts in the data plane. Per the terminology of
\[[RFC6550](#RFC6550){.xref}\], an IPv6 host
\[[RFC8504](#RFC8504){.xref}\] that is reachable over the RPL network is
called a \"leaf\".[¶](#section-1-6){.pilcrow}

[Section 2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9008#section-2){.relref}
of \[[RFC9008](#RFC9008){.xref}\] defines the terms \"RPL leaf\",
\"RPL-Aware Leaf\" (RAL), and \"RPL-Unaware Leaf\" (RUL). A RPL leaf is
a host attached to one or more RPL routers; as such, it relies on the
RPL router(s) to forward its traffic across the RPL domain but does not
forward traffic from another node. As opposed to the RAL, the RUL does
not participate in RPL and relies on its RPL router(s) to also inject
the routes to its IPv6 addresses in the RPL
domain.[¶](#section-1-7){.pilcrow}

A RUL may be unable to participate because it is very energy constrained
or code-space constrained, or because it would be unsafe to let it
inject routes in RPL. Using 6LoWPAN ND as opposed to RPL as the
host-to-router interface limits the surface of the possible attacks by
the RUL against the RPL domain. If all RULs and RPL-Aware Nodes (RANs)
use 6LoWPAN ND for the neighbor discovery process, it is also possible
to protect the address ownership of all nodes, including the
RULs.[¶](#section-1-8){.pilcrow}

This document specifies how the router injects the host routes in the
RPL domain on behalf of the RUL. [Section 5](#prereq){.xref} details how
the RUL can leverage 6LoWPAN ND to obtain the routing services from the
router. In that model, the RUL is also a 6LoWPAN Node (6LN) and the
RPL-aware router is also a 6LoWPAN Router (6LR). Using the 6LoWPAN ND
Address Registration mechanism, the RUL signals that the router must
inject a host route for the Registered
Address.[¶](#section-1-9){.pilcrow}

[Figure 1](#figure-1){.selfRef}: [Injecting Routes on Behalf of
RULs](#name-injecting-routes-on-behalf-){.selfRef}
:::

The RPL Non-Storing mode mechanism is used to extend the routing state
with connectivity to the RULs even when the DODAG is operated in Storing
mode. The unicast packet-forwarding operation by the 6LR serving a RUL
is described in [Section
4.1.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9008#section-4.1.1){.relref} of
\[[RFC9008](#RFC9008){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-11){.pilcrow}

Examples of possible RULs include severely energy-constrained sensors
such as window smash sensors (alarm system) and kinetically powered
light switches. Other applications of this specification may include a
smart grid network that controls appliances \-- such as washing machines
or the heating system \-- in the home. Appliances may not participate in
the RPL protocol operated in the smart grid network but can still
interact with the smart grid for control and/or
metering.[¶](#section-1-12){.pilcrow}

This specification can be deployed incrementally in a network that
implements \[[RFC9008](#RFC9008){.xref}\]. Only the root and the 6LRs
that connect the RULs need to be upgraded. The RPL routers on the path
will only see unicast IPv6 traffic between the root and the
6LR.[¶](#section-1-13){.pilcrow}

This document is organized as follows:[¶](#section-1-14){.pilcrow}

-   [Sections [3](#prereqv6){.xref} and [4](#lpnd){.xref} present in a
    non-normative fashion the salient aspects of RPL and 6LoWPAN ND,
    respectively, that are leveraged in this specification to provide
    connectivity to a 6LN acting as a RUL across a RPL
    network.[¶](#section-1-15.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-15.1}
-   [[Section 5](#prereq){.xref} lists the requirements that a RUL needs
    to match in order to be served by a RPL router that complies with
    this specification.[¶](#section-1-15.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-15.2}
-   [[Section 6](#upd){.xref} presents the changes made to
    \[[RFC6550](#RFC6550){.xref}\]; a new behavior is introduced whereby
    the 6LR advertises the 6LN\'s addresses in a RPL Destination
    Advertisement Object (DAO) message based on the ND registration by
    the 6LN, and the RPL DODAG root performs the Extended Duplicate
    Address Request / Extended Duplicate Address Confirmation
    (EDAR/EDAC) exchange with the 6LoWPAN Border Router (6LBR) on behalf
    of the 6LR; modifications are introduced to some RPL options and to
    the RPL Status to facilitate the integration of the

Low-Power and Lossy Networks](#RFC7102){.xref}\"
\[[RFC7102](#RFC7102){.xref}\]. A glossary of classical 6LoWPAN

use in LLNs are found in \"[Terminology for Constrained-Node
Networks](#RFC7228){.xref}\" \[[RFC7228](#RFC7228){.xref}\]. This
specification uses the terms \"6LN\" and \"6LR\" to refer specifically
to nodes that implement the 6LN and 6LR roles in 6LoWPAN ND and does not
expect other functionality such as 6LoWPAN Header Compression
\[[RFC6282](#RFC6282){.xref}\] from those
nodes.[¶](#section-2.3-1){.pilcrow}

\"RPL\", \"RPI\", \"RPL Instance\" (indexed by a RPLInstanceID), \"up\",
and \"down\" are defined in \"[RPL: IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power
and Lossy Networks](#RFC6550){.xref}\" \[[RFC6550](#RFC6550){.xref}\].
The RPI is the abstract information that RPL defines to be placed in
data packets, e.g., as the RPL Option \[[RFC6553](#RFC6553){.xref}\]
within the IPv6 Hop-By-Hop Header. By extension, the term \"RPI\" is
often used to refer to the RPL Option itself. The DAO and DIO messages
are also specified in \[[RFC6550](#RFC6550){.xref}\]. The DCO message is
defined in \[[RFC9009](#RFC9009){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2.3-2){.pilcrow}

This document uses the terms \"RUL\", \"RAN\", and \"RAL\" consistently
with \[[RFC9008](#RFC9008){.xref}\]. A RAN is either a RAL or a RPL
router. As opposed to a RUL, a RAN manages the reachability of its
addresses and prefixes by injecting them in RPL by
itself.[¶](#section-2.3-3){.pilcrow}

## [3.](#section-3){.section-number .selfRef} [RPL External Routes and Data-Plane Artifacts](#name-rpl-external-routes-and-dat){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-rpl-external-routes-and-dat}

RPL was initially designed to build stub networks whereby the only
border router would be the RPL DODAG root (typically co-located with the
6LBR) and all the nodes in the stub would be RPL aware. But
\[[RFC6550](#RFC6550){.xref}\] was also prepared to be extended for
external routes (\"targets\" in RPL parlance), via the External (\'E\')
flag in the Transit Information Option (TIO). External targets provide
the ability to reach destinations that are outside the RPL domain and
connected to the RPL domain via RPL border routers that are not the
root. [Section
4.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9008#section-4.1){.relref} of
\[[RFC9008](#RFC9008){.xref}\] provides a set of rules (summarized
below) that must be followed for routing packets to and from an external
destination. A RUL is a special case of an external target that is also
a host directly connected to the RPL domain.[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

A 6LR that acts as a border router for external routes advertises them
using Non-Storing mode DAO messages that are unicast directly to the
root, even if the DODAG is operated in Storing mode. Non-Storing mode
routes are not visible inside the RPL domain, and all packets are routed
via the root. The RPL DODAG root tunnels the data packets directly to
the 6LR that advertised the external route, which decapsulates and
forwards the original (inner) packets.[¶](#section-3-2){.pilcrow}

The RPL Non-Storing MOP signaling and the associated IPv6-in-IPv6
encapsulated packets appear as normal traffic to the intermediate
routers. Support of external routes only impacts the root and the 6LR.
It can be operated with legacy intermediate routers and does not add to
the amount of state that must be maintained in those routers. A RUL is
an example of a destination that is reachable via an external route that
happens to also be a host route.[¶](#section-3-3){.pilcrow}

The RPL data packets typically carry a Hop-by-Hop Header with a RPL
Option \[[RFC6553](#RFC6553){.xref}\] that contains the RPI (the RPL
Packet Information, as defined in [Section
11.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6550#section-11.2){.relref} of
\[[RFC6550](#RFC6550){.xref}\]). Unless the RUL already placed a RPL
Option in the outer header chain, the packets from and to the RUL are
encapsulated using an IPv6-in-IPv6 tunnel between the root and the 6LR
that serves the RUL (see
Sections [7](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9008#section-7){.relref}
and [8](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9008#section-8){.relref} of
\[[RFC9008](#RFC9008){.xref}\] for details). If the packet from the RUL
has an RPI, the 6LR acting as a RPL border router rewrites the RPI to
indicate the selected RPL Instance and set the flags, but it does not
need to encapsulate the packet (see [Section
9.2.2](#lr){.xref}).[¶](#section-3-4){.pilcrow}

In Non-Storing mode, packets going down the DODAG carry a Source Routing
Header (SRH). The IPv6-in-IPv6 encapsulation, the RPI, and the SRH are
collectively called the \"RPL artifacts\" and can be compressed using
the method defined in \[[RFC8138](#RFC8138){.xref}\]. [Appendix
A](#u8138){.xref} presents an example compressed format for a packet
forwarded by the root to a RUL in a Storing mode
DODAG.[¶](#section-3-5){.pilcrow}

The inner packet that is forwarded to the RUL may carry some RPL
artifacts, e.g., an RPI if the original packet was generated with it,
and an SRH in a Non-Storing mode DODAG. \[[RFC9008](#RFC9008){.xref}\]
expects the RUL to support the basic IPv6 node requirements per
\[[RFC8504](#RFC8504){.xref}\] and, in particular, the mandates in
Sections [4.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8200#section-4.2){.relref}
and [4.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8200#section-4.4){.relref}
of \[[RFC8200](#RFC8200){.xref}\]. As such, the RUL is expected to
ignore the RPL artifacts that may be left over \-- either an SRH whose
Segments Left is zero or a RPL Option in the Hop-by-Hop Header (which
can be skipped when not recognized; see [Section
5.3](#prereqv6hh){.xref} for details).[¶](#section-3-6){.pilcrow}

A RUL is not expected to support the compression method defined in
\[[RFC8138](#RFC8138){.xref}\]. For that reason, the border router (the
6LR here) uncompresses the packet before forwarding it over an external
route to a RUL

The classical IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (IPv6 ND) protocol
\[[RFC4861](#RFC4861){.xref}\] \[[RFC4862](#RFC4862){.xref}\] was
defined for serial links and transit media such as Ethernet. It is a
reactive protocol that relies heavily on multicast operations for
Address Discovery (aka address lookup) and Duplicate Address Detection
(DAD).[¶](#section-4.1-1){.pilcrow}

\"[Neighbor Discovery Optimization for IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless
Personal Area Networks (6LoWPANs)](#RFC6775){.xref}\"
\[[RFC6775](#RFC6775){.xref}\] adapts IPv6 ND for operations over
energy-constrained LLNs. The main functions of
\[[RFC6775](#RFC6775){.xref}\] are to proactively establish the Neighbor
Cache Entry (NCE) in the 6LR and to prevent address duplication. To that
effect, \[[RFC6775](#RFC6775){.xref}\] introduces a unicast Address
Registration mechanism that contributes to reducing the use of multicast
messages compared to the classical IPv6 ND
protocol.[¶](#section-4.1-2){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC6775](#RFC6775){.xref}\] also introduces the Address Registration
Option (ARO), which is carried in the unicast Neighbor Solicitation (NS)
and Neighbor Advertisement (NA) messages between the 6LoWPAN Node (6LN)
and the 6LoWPAN router (6LR). It also defines the Duplicate Address
Request (DAR) and Duplicate Address Confirmation (DAC) messages between
the 6LR and the 6LBR). In an LLN, the 6LBR is the central repository of
all the Registered Addresses in its domain and the source of truth for
uniqueness and ownership.[¶](#section-4.1-3){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC8505](#RFC8505){.xref}\] introduces the R flag in the EARO. The
Registering Node sets the R flag to indicate whether the 6LR should
ensure reachability for the Registered Address. If the R flag is set to
0, then the Registering Node handles the reachability of the Registered
Address by other means. In a RPL network, this means that either it is a
RAN that injects the route by itself or it uses another RPL router for
reachability services.[¶](#section-4.2.1-1){.pilcrow}

This document specifies how the R flag is used in the context of RPL. A
RPL leaf that implements the 6LN functionality from
\[[RFC8505](#RFC8505){.xref}\] requires reachability services for an
IPv6 address if and only if it sets the R flag in the NS(EARO) used to
register the address to a 6LR acting as a RPL border router. Upon
receiving the NS(EARO), the RPL router generates a DAO message for the
Registered Address if and only if the R flag is set to
1.[¶](#section-4.2.1-2){.pilcrow}

[Section 9.2](#oper){.xref} specifies additional operations when the R
flag is set to 1 in an EARO that is placed in either an NS message or an
NA message.[¶](#section-4.2.1-3){.pilcrow}

When the T flag is set to 1, the EARO includes a sequence counter called
the \"Transaction ID\" (TID), which is needed to fill the Path Sequence
field in the RPL Transit Information Option (TIO). For this reason,
support of \[[RFC8505](#RFC8505){.xref}\] by the RUL, as opposed to only
\[[RFC6775](#RFC6775){.xref}\], is a prerequisite for this
specification; this requirement is fully explained in [Section

associated \"I\" field that describes what the Opaque field transports
and how to use it.[¶](#section-4.2.2-1){.pilcrow}

[Section
5.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8505#section-5.3){.relref} of
\[[RFC8505](#RFC8505){.xref}\] introduces the Registration Ownership
Verifier (ROVR) field, which has a variable length of 64 to 256 bits.
The ROVR replaces the 64-bit Extended Unique Identifier (EUI‑64) in the
ARO \[[RFC6775](#RFC6775){.xref}\], which was used to uniquely identify
an Address Registration with the link-layer address of the owner but
provided no protection against spoofing.[¶](#section-4.2.3-1){.pilcrow}

\"[Address-Protected Neighbor Discovery for Low-Power and Lossy
Networks](#RFC8928){.xref}\" \[[RFC8928](#RFC8928){.xref}\] leverages
the ROVR field as a cryptographic proof of ownership to prevent a rogue
third party from registering an address that is already owned. The use
of the ROVR field enables the 6LR to block traffic that is not sourced
at an owned address.[¶](#section-4.2.3-2){.pilcrow}

This specification does not address how the protection offered by
\[[RFC8928](#RFC8928){.xref}\] could be extended for use in RPL. On the
other hand, it adds the ROVR to the DAO to build the proxied EDAR at the

\[[RFC8505](#RFC8505){.xref}\] updates the DAR/DAC messages to EDAR/EDAC
messages to carry the ROVR field. The EDAR/EDAC exchange takes place
between the 6LR and the 6LBR. It is triggered by an NS(EARO) message
from a 6LN to create, refresh, and delete the corresponding state in the
6LBR. The exchange is protected by the retry mechanism specified in
[Section
8.2.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6775#section-8.2.6){.relref} of
\[[RFC6775](#RFC6775){.xref}\], though in an LLN, a duration longer than
the default value of the RetransTimer (RETRANS_TIMER)
\[[RFC4861](#RFC4861){.xref}\] of 1 second may be necessary to cover the
round-trip delay between the 6LR and the
6LBR.[¶](#section-4.3-1){.pilcrow}

RPL \[[RFC6550](#RFC6550){.xref}\] specifies a periodic DAO from the 6LN
all the way to the root that maintains the routing state in the RPL
network for the lifetime indicated by the source of the DAO. This means
that for each address, there are two keep-alive messages that traverse
the whole network: one to the root and one to the
6LBR.[¶](#section-4.3-2){.pilcrow}

This specification avoids the periodic EDAR/EDAC exchange across the
LLN. The 6LR turns the periodic NS(EARO) from the RUL into a DAO message
to the root on every refresh, but it only generates the EDAR upon the
first registration, for the purpose of DAD, which must be verified
before the address is injected in RPL. Upon the DAO message, the root
proxies the EDAR exchange to refresh the state at the 6LBR on behalf of
the 6LR, as illustrated in [Figure 8](#fReg2){.xref} in [Section

To obtain routing services from a router that implements this
specification, a RUL needs to implement \[[RFC8505](#RFC8505){.xref}\]
and sets the \"R\" and \"T\" flags in the EARO to 1 as discussed in
Sections [4.2.1](#R8505ER){.xref} and [4.2.2](#R8505ETID){.xref},
respectively. [Section 9.2.1](#ln){.xref} specifies new behaviors for
the RUL, e.g., when the R flag set to 1 in an NS(EARO) is not echoed in
the NA(EARO), which indicates that the route injection
failed.[¶](#section-5.1-1){.pilcrow}

The RUL is expected to request routing services from a router only if
that router originates RA messages with a 6CIO that has the L, P, and E
flags all set to 1 as discussed in [Section 4.3.1](#R7400){.xref},
unless configured to do so. It is suggested that the RUL also implement
\[[RFC8928](#RFC8928){.xref}\] to protect the ownership of its
addresses.[¶](#section-5.1-2){.pilcrow}

A RUL that may attach to multiple 6LRs is expected to prefer those that
provide routing services. The RUL needs to register with all the 6LRs
from which it desires routing services.[¶](#section-5.1-3){.pilcrow}

Parallel Address Registrations to several 6LRs should be performed in a
rapid sequence, using the same EARO for the same address. Gaps between
the Address Registrations will invalidate some of the routes until the
Address Registration finally shows on those
routes.[¶](#section-5.1-4){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC8505](#RFC8505){.xref}\] introduces error Status values in the
NA(EARO) that can be received synchronously upon an NS(EARO) or
asynchronously. The RUL needs to support both cases and refrain from
using the address when the Status value indicates a rejection (see
[Section 6.3](#stat){.xref}).[¶](#section-5.1-5){.pilcrow}

[Section

\[[RFC9008](#RFC9008){.xref}\] defines the rules for signaling an
external destination (e.g., a RUL) and tunneling to its attachment
router (designated as a 6LR). In order to terminate the IPv6-in-IPv6
tunnel, the RUL, as an IPv6 host, would have to be capable of
decapsulating the tunneled packet and either drop the encapsulated
packet if it is not the final destination or pass it to the upper layer
for further processing. As indicated in [Section
4.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9008#section-4.1){.relref} of
\[[RFC9008](#RFC9008){.xref}\], this is not mandated by
\[[RFC8504](#RFC8504){.xref}\], and the IPv6-in-IPv6 tunnel from the

This document specifies a new behavior whereby a 6LR injects DAO
messages for unicast addresses (see [Section 9](#op){.xref}) and
multicast addresses (see [Section 10](#multiop){.xref}) on behalf of
leaves that are not aware of RPL. The RUL addresses are exposed as
external targets \[[RFC6550](#RFC6550){.xref}\]. Conforming to
\[[RFC9008](#RFC9008){.xref}\], IPv6-in-IPv6 encapsulation between the
6LR and the RPL DODAG root is used to carry the RPL artifacts and remove
them when forwarding outside the RPL domain, e.g., to a
RUL.[¶](#section-6-1){.pilcrow}

This document also synchronizes the liveness monitoring at the root and
the 6LBR. The same lifetime value is used for both, and a single
keep-alive message, the RPL DAO, traverses the RPL network. Another new
behavior is introduced whereby the RPL DODAG root proxies the EDAR
message to the 6LBR on behalf of the 6LR (see [Section
8](#upd2){.xref}), for any leaf node that implements the 6LN
functionality described in
\[[RFC8505](#RFC8505){.xref}\].[¶](#section-6-2){.pilcrow}

[Section
6.7.7](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6550#section-6.7.7){.relref} of
\[[RFC6550](#RFC6550){.xref}\] introduces the RPL Target option, which
can be used in RPL control messages such as the DAO message to signal a
destination prefix. This document adds capabilities for transporting the
ROVR field (see [Section 4.2.3](#R8505EROVR){.xref}) and the IPv6
address of the prefix advertiser when the Target is a shorter prefix.
Their use is signaled by a new ROVR Size field being non-zero and a new
\"Advertiser address in Full (F)\" flag set to 1, respectively; see
[Section 6.1](#tgt){.xref}.[¶](#section-6-3){.pilcrow}

This specification defines a new flag, \"Root Proxies EDAR/EDAC (P)\",
in the RPL DODAG Configuration option; see [Section
6.2](#pflag){.xref}.[¶](#section-6-4){.pilcrow}

Furthermore, this specification provides the ability to carry the EARO
Status defined for 6LoWPAN ND in RPL DAO and DCO messages, embedded in a
RPL Status; see [Section 6.3](#stat){.xref}.[¶](#section-6-5){.pilcrow}

[Section 12](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6550#section-12){.relref}
of \[[RFC6550](#RFC6550){.xref}\] details RPL support for multicast
flows when the RPL Instance is operated with a MOP setting of 3
(\"Storing Mode of Operation with multicast support\"). This
specification extends the RPL DODAG root operation to proxy-relay the
MLDv2 operation \[[RFC3810](#RFC3810){.xref}\] between the RUL and the
6LR; see [Section 10](#multiop){.xref}.[¶](#section-6-6){.pilcrow}

### [6.1.](#section-6.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Updated RPL Target Option](#name-updated-rpl-target-option){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-updated-rpl-target-option}

This specification updates the RPL Target option to transport the ROVR
that was also defined for 6LoWPAN ND messages. This enables the RPL
DODAG root to generate the proxied EDAR message to the
6LBR.[¶](#section-6.1-1){.pilcrow}

The Target Prefix of the RPL Target option is left (high bit) justified
and contains the advertised prefix; its size may be smaller than 128
when it indicates a prefix route. The Prefix Length field signals the
number of bits that correspond to the advertised prefix; it is 128 for a
host route or less in the case of a prefix route. This remains
unchanged.[¶](#section-6.1-2){.pilcrow}

This specification defines the new \'F\' flag. When it is set to 1, the
size of the Target Prefix field [MUST]{.bcp14} be 128 bits and it
[MUST]{.bcp14} contain an IPv6 address of the advertising node taken
from the advertised prefix. In that case, the Target Prefix field
carries two distinct pieces of information: a route that can be a host
route or a prefix route, depending on the Prefix Length; and an IPv6
address that can be used to reach the advertising node and validate the
route.[¶](#section-6.1-3){.pilcrow}

If the \'F\' flag is set to 0, the Target Prefix field can be shorter
than 128 bits, and it [MUST]{.bcp14} be aligned to the next byte
boundary after the end of the prefix. Any additional bits in the
rightmost octet are filled with padding bits. Padding bits are reserved
and set to 0 as specified in [Section
6.7.7](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6550#section-6.7.7){.relref} of
\[[RFC6550](#RFC6550){.xref}\].[¶](#section-6.1-4){.pilcrow}

With this specification, the ROVR is the remainder of the RPL Target
option. The size of the ROVR is indicated in a new ROVR Size field that
is encoded to map one to one with the Code Suffix in the EDAR message
(see Table 4 of \[[RFC8505](#RFC8505){.xref}\]). The ROVR Size field is
taken from the Flags field, which is an update to the \"RPL Target
Option Flags\" IANA registry.[¶](#section-6.1-5){.pilcrow}

The updated format is illustrated in [Figure 4](#frpltgt){.xref}. It is
backward compatible with the Target option defined in
\[[RFC6550](#RFC6550){.xref}\]. It is recommended that the updated
format be used as a replacement in new implementations in all MOPs in
preparation for upcoming route ownership validation mechanisms based on
the ROVR, unless the device or the network is so constrained that this
is not feasible.[¶](#section-6.1-6){.pilcrow}

The 6LoWPAN ND Status was defined for use in the EARO; see [Section
4.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8505#section-4.1){.relref} of
\[[RFC8505](#RFC8505){.xref}\]. This specification adds the ability to
allow the carriage of 6LoWPAN ND Status values in RPL DAO and DCO
messages, embedded in the RPL Status field.[¶](#section-6.3-3){.pilcrow}

To achieve this, the range of the ARO/EARO Status values is reduced to
0-63, which updates the IANA registry created for
\[[RFC6775](#RFC6775){.xref}\]. This reduction ensures that the values
fit within a RPL Status as shown in [Figure 6](#rpst){.xref}. See
Sections [12.2](#iana-aro){.xref}, [12.5](#iana-stats-nonrej){.xref},
and [12.6](#iana-stats-rej){.xref} for the respective IANA declarations.
These updates are reasonable because the associated registry relies on
the Standards Action policy \[[RFC8126](#RFC8126){.xref}\] for
registration and only values up to 10 are currently
allocated.[¶](#section-6.3-4){.pilcrow}

This specification extends the use of the DCO message to the Non-Storing
MOP, whereby the DCO is sent end to end by the root directly to the RAN
that injected the DAO message for the considered target. In that case,
intermediate nodes do not need to support
\[[RFC9009](#RFC9009){.xref}\]; they forward the DCO message as a plain
IPv6 packet between the root and the RAN.[¶](#section-7-2){.pilcrow}

This specification eliminates the need to exchange keep-alive EDAR and
EDAC messages all the way from a 6LN to the 6LBR across a RPL mesh.
Instead, the EDAR/EDAC exchange with the 6LBR is proxied by the RPL
DODAG root upon the DAO message that refreshes the RPL routing state.
The first EDAR upon a new Address Registration cannot be proxied,
though, as it is generated for the purpose of DAD, which must be
verified before the address is injected in
RPL.[¶](#section-9.1-1){.pilcrow}

In a RPL network where the function is enabled, refreshing the state in
the 6LBR is the responsibility of the root. Consequently, only addresses
that are injected in RPL will be kept alive at the 6LBR by the RPL DODAG
root. Since RULs are advertised using Non-Storing mode, the DAO message
flow and the keep-alive EDAR/EDAC can be nested within the Address
(re)Registration flow. [Figure 7](#fReg1){.xref} illustrates that, for
the first Address Registration, both the DAD and the keep-alive
EDAR⁠/EDAC exchanges happen in the same
sequence.[¶](#section-9.1-2){.pilcrow}

[Figure 7](#figure-7){.selfRef}: [First RUL Registration
Flow](#name-first-rul-registration-flow){.selfRef}
:::

This flow requires that the lifetimes and sequence counters in 6LoWPAN
ND and RPL be aligned.[¶](#section-9.1-4){.pilcrow}

To achieve this, the Path Sequence and the Path Lifetime in the DAO
message are taken from the Transaction ID and the Address Registration
lifetime in the NS(EARO) message from the
6LN.[¶](#section-9.1-5){.pilcrow}

On the first Address Registration, illustrated in [Figure
7](#fReg1){.xref} for RPL Non-Storing mode, the EDAR/EDAC exchange takes
place as prescribed by \[[RFC8505](#RFC8505){.xref}\]. If the exchange
fails, the 6LR returns an NA message with a non-zero status to the 6LN,
the NCE is not created, and the address is not injected in RPL.
Otherwise, the 6LR creates an NCE and injects the Registered Address in
the RPL routing using a DAO/DAO-ACK exchange with the RPL DODAG
root.[¶](#section-9.1-6){.pilcrow}

An Address Registration refresh is performed by the 6LN to keep the NCE
in the 6LR alive before the lifetime expires. Upon the refresh of a
registration, the 6LR reinjects the corresponding route in RPL before it
expires, as illustrated in [Figure
8](#fReg2){.xref}.[¶](#section-9.1-7){.pilcrow}

Flow](#name-next-rul-registration-flow){.selfRef}
:::

This is what causes the RPL DODAG root to refresh the state in the 6LBR,
using an EDAC message. In the case of an error in the proxied EDAR flow,
the error is returned in the DAO-ACK using a RPL Status with the \'A\'
flag set to 1, which embeds a 6LoWPAN Status value as discussed in
[Section 6.3](#stat){.xref}.[¶](#section-9.1-9){.pilcrow}

The 6LR may receive a requested DAO-ACK after it received an
asynchronous Non-Storing DCO, but the non-zero status in the DCO
supersedes a positive status in the DAO-ACK, regardless of the order in
which they are received. Upon the DAO-ACK \-- or the DCO, if one arrives
first \-- the 6LR responds to the RUL with an
NA(EARO).[¶](#section-9.1-10){.pilcrow}

An issue may be detected later, e.g., the address moves to a different
DODAG with the 6LBR attached to a different 6LoWPAN Backbone Router
(6BBR); see Figure 5 in [Section
3.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8929#section-3.3){.relref} of
\[[RFC8929](#RFC8929){.xref}\]. The 6BBR may send a negative ND Status,
e.g., in an asynchronous NA(EARO) to the
6LBR.[¶](#section-9.1-11){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC8929](#RFC8929){.xref}\] expects that the 6LBR is co-located with
the RPL DODAG root, but if not, the 6LBR [MUST]{.bcp14} forward the
status code to the originator of the EDAR \-- either the 6LR or the RPL
DODAG root that proxies for it. The ND status code is mapped in a RPL
Status value by the RPL DODAG root, and then back to an ND Status by the
6LR to the 6LN. Note that a legacy RAN that receives a Non-Storing DCO
that it does not support will ignore it silently, as specified in
[Section 6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6550#section-6){.relref}
of \[[RFC6550](#RFC6550){.xref}\]. The result is that it will remain
unaware that it is no longer reachable until its next RPL exchange
happens. This situation will be cleared upon the next Non-Storing DAO
exchange if the error is returned in a
DAO-ACK.[¶](#section-9.1-12){.pilcrow}

[Figure 9](#fReg1.5){.xref} illustrates this in the case where the 6LBR
and the root are not co-located, and the root proxies the EDAR/EDAC

    are set to the same value for all of the parallel Address
    Registrations, with the exception of the Registration Lifetime field
    and the R flag, which may be set to different values. The 6LN may
    cancel a subset of its registrations or may transfer a registration
    from one or more old 6LRs to one or more new 6LRs. To do so, the 6LN
    sends a series of NS(EARO) messages, all with the same TID, with a
    zero Registration Lifetime to the old 6LR(s) and with a non-zero
    Registration Lifetime to the new 6LR(s). In that process, the 6LN
    [SHOULD]{.bcp14} send the NS(EARO) with a non-zero Registration

    NS(EARO) that terminates another registration. This avoids the churn
    related to transient route invalidation in the RPL network above the
    common parent of the involved

5.  [Following [Section
    5.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8505#section-5.1){.relref} of
    \[[RFC8505](#RFC8505){.xref}\], a 6LN acting as a RUL sets the R
    flag in the EARO of its registration(s) for which it requires
    routing services. If the R flag is not echoed in the NA, the RUL
    [MUST]{.bcp14} assume that establishing the routing services via
    this 6LR failed, and it [SHOULD]{.bcp14} attempt to use another 6LR.
    The RUL [SHOULD]{.bcp14} ensure that one registration succeeds
    before setting the R flag to 0. In the case of a conflict with the
    preceding rule regarding the lifetime, the rule regarding the
    lifetime has
    precedence.[¶](#section-9.2.1-2.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-9.2.1-2.5}
6.  [The 6LN may use any of the 6LRs to which it registered as the
    default gateway. Using a 6LR to which the 6LN is not registered may
    result in packets dropped at the 6LR by a Source Address Validation
    Improvement (SAVI) function \[[RFC7039](#RFC7039){.xref}\] and thus
    is not
    recommended.[¶](#section-9.2.1-2.6){.pilcrow}]{#section-9.2.1-2.6}

Even without support for RPL, the RUL may be configured with an opaque
value to be provided to the routing protocol. If the RUL has knowledge
of the RPL Instance into which the packet should be injected, then it
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} set the Opaque field in the EARO to the RPLInstanceID;
otherwise, it [MUST]{.bcp14} leave the Opaque field as
0.[¶](#section-9.2.1-3){.pilcrow}

Regardless of the setting of the Opaque field, the 6LN [MUST]{.bcp14}
set the \"I\" field to 0 to signal \"topological information to be
passed to a routing process\", as specified in [Section
5.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8505#section-5.1){.relref} of
\[[RFC8505](#RFC8505){.xref}\].[¶](#section-9.2.1-4){.pilcrow}

A RUL is not expected to produce RPL artifacts in the data packets, but
it may do so. For instance, if the RUL has minimal awareness of the RPL
Instance, then it can build an RPI. A RUL that places an RPI in a data
packet [SHOULD]{.bcp14} indicate the RPLInstanceID of the RPL Instance
where the packet should be forwarded. It is up to the 6LR (e.g., by
policy) to use the RPLInstanceID information provided by the RUL or
rewrite it to the selected RPLInstanceID for forwarding inside the RPL
domain. All the flags and the SenderRank field are set to 0 as specified
by [Section
11.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6550#section-11.2){.relref} of

A 6LR that provides reachability services for a RUL in a RPL network as
specified in this document [MUST]{.bcp14} include a 6CIO in its RA
messages and set the L, P, and E flags to 1 as prescribed by
\[[RFC8505](#RFC8505){.xref}\].[¶](#section-9.2.2-1){.pilcrow}

As prescribed by \[[RFC8505](#RFC8505){.xref}\], the 6LR generates an
EDAR message upon reception of a valid NS(EARO) message for the
registration of a new IPv6 address by a 6LN. If the initial EDAR/EDAC
exchange succeeds, then the 6LR installs an NCE for the Registration
Lifetime.[¶](#section-9.2.2-2){.pilcrow}

If the R flag is set to 1 in the NS(EARO), the 6LR [SHOULD]{.bcp14}
inject the host route in RPL, unless this is barred for other reasons,
such as the saturation of the RPL parents. The 6LR [MUST]{.bcp14} use
RPL Non-Storing mode signaling and the updated Target option (see
[Section 6.1](#tgt){.xref}). To avoid a redundant EDAR/EDAC flow to the
6LBR, the 6LR [SHOULD]{.bcp14} refrain from setting the \'X\' flag. The
6LR [MUST]{.bcp14} request a DAO-ACK by setting the \'K\' flag in the
DAO message. Successfully injecting the route to the RUL\'s address will
be indicated via the \'U\' flag set to 0 in the RPL Status of the
DAO-ACK message.[¶](#section-9.2.2-3){.pilcrow}

For the registration refreshes, if the RPL DODAG root sets the \'P\'
flag in the DODAG Configuration option to 1, then the 6LR [MUST]{.bcp14}
refrain from sending the keep-alive EDAR; instead, it [MUST]{.bcp14} set
the \'X\' flag to 1 in the Target option of the DAO messages, to request
that the root proxy the keep-alive EDAR/EDAC exchange with the 6LBR (see
[Section 6](#upd){.xref}); if the \'P\' flag is set to 0, then the 6LR
[MUST]{.bcp14} set the \'X\' flag to 0 and handle the EDAR/EDAC flow
itself.[¶](#section-9.2.2-4){.pilcrow}

The Opaque field in the EARO provides a means to signal which RPL
Instance is to be used for the DAO advertisements and the forwarding of
packets sourced at the Registered Address when there is no RPI in the
packet.[¶](#section-9.2.2-5){.pilcrow}

As described in \[[RFC8505](#RFC8505){.xref}\], if the \"I\" field is 0,
then the Opaque field is expected to carry the RPLInstanceID suggested
by the 6LN; otherwise, there is no suggested RPL Instance. If the 6LR
participates in the suggested RPL Instance, then the 6LR [MUST]{.bcp14}
use that RPL Instance for the Registered
Address.[¶](#section-9.2.2-6){.pilcrow}

If there is no suggested RPL Instance or if the 6LR does not participate
in the suggested RPL Instance, it is expected that the packets coming
from the 6LN \"can unambiguously be associated to at least one RPL
Instance\" \[[RFC6550](#RFC6550){.xref}\] by the 6LR, e.g., using a
policy that maps the 6-tuple to a RPL
Instance.[¶](#section-9.2.2-7){.pilcrow}

The DAO message advertising the Registered Address [MUST]{.bcp14} be
constructed as follows:[¶](#section-9.2.2-8){.pilcrow}

1.  [The Registered Address is signaled as the Target Prefix in the
    updated Target option in the DAO message; the Prefix Length is set
    to 128 but the \'F\' flag is set to 0, since the advertiser is not
    the RUL. The ROVR field is copied unchanged from the EARO (see
    [Section
    6.1](#tgt){.xref}).[¶](#section-9.2.2-9.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-9.2.2-9.1}

2.  [The 6LR indicates one of its global or unique-local IPv6 unicast
    addresses as the Parent Address in the TIO associated with the
    Target option.[¶](#section-9.2.2-9.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-9.2.2-9.2}

3.  [The 6LR sets the External (\'E\') flag in the TIO to indicate that
    it is redistributing an external target into the RPL
    network.[¶](#section-9.2.2-9.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-9.2.2-9.3}

4.  ::: {#section-9.2.2-9.4}
    The Path Lifetime in the TIO is computed from the Registration
    Lifetime in the EARO. This operation converts seconds to the
    Lifetime Units used in the RPL operation. This creates the
    deployment constraint that the Lifetime Unit is reasonably
    compatible with the expression of the Registration Lifetime; e.g., a
    Lifetime Unit of 0x4000 maps the most significant byte of the
    Registration Lifetime to the Path
    Lifetime.[¶](#section-9.2.2-9.4.1){.pilcrow}

    In that operation, the Path Lifetime must be set to ensure that the
    path has a longer lifetime than the registration and also covers the
    round-trip time to the root.[¶](#section-9.2.2-9.4.2){.pilcrow}

    Note that if the Registration Lifetime is 0, then the Path Lifetime
    is also 0 and the DAO message becomes a No-Path DAO, which cleans up
    the routes down to the RUL\'s address; this also causes the root as
    a proxy to send an EDAR message to the 6LBR with a Lifetime of
    0.[¶](#section-9.2.2-9.4.3){.pilcrow}
    :::

5.  [The Path Sequence in the TIO is set to the TID value found in the
    EARO.[¶](#section-9.2.2-9.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-9.2.2-9.5}

Upon receiving or timing out the DAO-ACK after an
implementation-specific number of retries, the 6LR [MUST]{.bcp14} send
the corresponding NA(EARO) to the RUL. Upon receiving an asynchronous
DCO message, it [MUST]{.bcp14} send an asynchronous NA(EARO) to the RUL
immediately but still be capable of processing the DAO-ACK if one is
pending.[¶](#section-9.2.2-10){.pilcrow}

The 6LR [MUST]{.bcp14} set the R flag to 1 in the NA(EARO) that it sends
back to the 6LN if and only if the \'U\' flag in the RPL Status is set
to 0, indicating that the 6LR injected the Registered Address in the RPL
routing successfully and that the EDAR proxy operation
succeeded.[¶](#section-9.2.2-11){.pilcrow}

If the \'A\' flag in the RPL Status is set to 1, the embedded Status
value is passed back to the RUL in the EARO Status. If the \'U\' flag is
also set to 1, the registration failed for 6LoWPAN-ND-related reasons,
and the NCE is removed.[¶](#section-9.2.2-12){.pilcrow}

An error injecting the route causes the \'U\' flag to be set to 1. If
the error is not related to ND, the \'A\' flag is set to 0. In that
case, the registration succeeds, but the RPL route is not installed. So,
the NA(EARO) is returned with a status indicating success but the R flag
set to 0, which means that the 6LN obtained a binding but no
route.[¶](#section-9.2.2-13){.pilcrow}

If the \'A\' flag is set to 0 in the RPL Status of the DAO-ACK, then the
6LoWPAN ND operation succeeded, and an EARO Status of 0 (Success)
[MUST]{.bcp14} be returned to the 6LN. The EARO Status of 0
[MUST]{.bcp14} also be used if the 6LR did not attempt to inject the
route but could create the binding after a successful EDAR/EDAC exchange
or refresh it.[¶](#section-9.2.2-14){.pilcrow}

If the \'U\' flag is set to 1 in the RPL Status of the DAO-ACK, then the
route was not installed, and the R flag [MUST]{.bcp14} be set to 0 in
the NA(EARO). The R flag [MUST]{.bcp14} be set to 0 if the 6LR did not
attempt to inject the route.[¶](#section-9.2.2-15){.pilcrow}

In a network where Address-Protected Neighbor Discovery (AP-ND) is
enabled, in the case of a DAO-ACK or a DCO transporting an EARO Status
value of 5 (Validation Requested), the 6LR [MUST]{.bcp14} challenge the
6LN for ownership of the address, as described in [Section
6.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8928#section-6.1){.relref} of
\[[RFC8928](#RFC8928){.xref}\], before the registration is complete.
This flow, illustrated in [Figure 10](#Dynamic-fig){.xref}, ensures that
the address is validated before it is injected in the RPL
routing.[¶](#section-9.2.2-16){.pilcrow}

If the challenge succeeded, then the operations continue as normal. In
particular, a DAO message is generated upon the NS(EARO) that proves the
ownership of the address. If the challenge failed, the 6LR rejects the
registration as prescribed by AP-ND and may take actions to protect
itself against Denial-Of-Service (DoS) attacks by a rogue 6LN; see
[Section

The 6LR may, at any time, send a unicast asynchronous NA(EARO) with the
R flag set to 0 to signal that it has stopped providing routing
services, and/or with an EARO Status of 2 (Neighbor Cache Full) to
signal that it removed the NCE. It may also send a final RA \-- unicast
or multicast \-- with a router Lifetime field of 0, to signal that it
will cease to serve as the router, as specified in [Section
6.2.5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4861#section-6.2.5){.relref} of

message indicating that the path is already removed; otherwise, the 6LR
[MUST]{.bcp14} remove the host route to the 6LN using a DAO message with
a Path Lifetime of 0.[¶](#section-9.2.2-19){.pilcrow}

A valid NS(EARO) message with the R flag set to 0 and a Registration
Lifetime that is not zero signals that the 6LN wishes to maintain the
binding but does not require (i.e., no longer requires) the routing
services from the 6LR. Upon this message, if, due to a previous NS(EARO)
with the R flag set to 1 the 6LR was injecting the host route to the
Registered Address in RPL using DAO messages, then the 6LR
[MUST]{.bcp14} invalidate the host route in RPL using a DAO with a Path
Lifetime of 0. It is up to the registering 6LN to maintain the
corresponding route from then on, by either (1) keeping it active via a
different 6LR or (2) acting as a RAN and managing its own
reachability.[¶](#section-9.2.2-20){.pilcrow}

When forwarding a packet from the RUL into the RPL domain, if the packet
does not have an RPI, the 6LR [MUST]{.bcp14} encapsulate the packet to

[Section 12](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6550#section-12){.relref}
of \[[RFC6550](#RFC6550){.xref}\] details RPL support for multicast
flows. This support is activated by setting the MOP value to 3
(\"Storing Mode of Operation with multicast support\") in the DIO
messages that form the DODAG. This section also applies if and only if
the MOP of the RPL Instance is 3.[¶](#section-10-1){.pilcrow}

RPL support for multicast is not source specific and only operates as an
extension to the Storing mode of operation for unicast packets. Note
that it is the RPL model that the multicast packet is copied and
transmitted as a Layer 2 unicast to each of the interested children.
This remains true when forwarding between the 6LR and the listener
6LN.[¶](#section-10-2){.pilcrow}

\"[Multicast Listener Discovery Version 2 (MLDv2) for
IPv6](#RFC3810){.xref}\" \[[RFC3810](#RFC3810){.xref}\] provides an
interface for a listener to register with multicast flows. In the MLD
model, the router is a \"querier\", and the host is a multicast listener
that registers with the querier to obtain copies of the particular flows
it is interested in.[¶](#section-10-3){.pilcrow}

The equivalent of the first Address Registration happens as illustrated
in [Figure 11](#fReg3){.xref}. The 6LN, as an MLD listener, sends an
unsolicited Report to the 6LR. This enables it to start receiving the
flow immediately and causes the 6LR to inject the multicast route in
RPL.[¶](#section-10-4){.pilcrow}

Flow](#name-first-multicast-registratio){.selfRef}
:::

This specification does not change MLD but will operate more efficiently
if the asynchronous messages for unsolicited Report and Done are sent by
the 6LN as Layer 2 unicast to the 6LR, particularly on
wireless.[¶](#section-10-6){.pilcrow}

The 6LR acts as a generic MLD querier and generates a DAO with the
multicast address as the Target Prefix as described in [Section
12](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6550#section-12){.relref} of
\[[RFC6550](#RFC6550){.xref}\]. As for the unicast host routes, the Path
Lifetime associated to the Target is mapped from the Query Interval and
is set to be larger, to account for variable propagation delays to the
root. The root proxies the MLD exchange as a listener with the 6LBR
acting as the querier, so as to get packets from a source external to
the RPL domain.[¶](#section-10-7){.pilcrow}

Upon a DAO with a Target option for a multicast address, the RPL DODAG
root checks to see if it is already registered as a listener for that
address, and if not, it performs its own unsolicited Report for the
multicast address as described in [Section
6.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3810#section-6.1){.relref} of
\[[RFC3810](#RFC3810){.xref}\]. The Report is source independent, so
there is no source address listed.[¶](#section-10-8){.pilcrow}

The equivalent of the registration refresh is pulled periodically by the
6LR acting as the querier. Upon the timing out of the Query Interval,
the 6LR sends a Multicast Address Specific Query to each of its
listeners, for each multicast address. The listeners respond with a
Report. Based on the Reports, the 6LR maintains the aggregated list of
all the multicast addresses for which there is a listener and advertises
them using DAO messages as specified in [Section
12](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6550#section-12){.relref} of
\[[RFC6550](#RFC6550){.xref}\]. Optionally, the 6LR [MAY]{.bcp14} send a
General Query, where the Multicast Address field is set to 0. In that
case, the multicast packet is passed as a Layer 2 unicast to each of the
interested children.[¶](#section-10-9){.pilcrow}

Upon a Report, the 6LR generates a DAO with as many Target options as
there are Multicast Address Records in the Report message, copying the
Multicast Address field in the Target Prefix of the RPL Target option.
The DAO message is a Storing mode DAO, passed to a selection of the
6LR\'s parents.[¶](#section-10-10){.pilcrow}

Asynchronously to this, a similar procedure happens between the root and
a router, such as the 6LBR, that serves multicast flows on the link
where the root is located. Again, the Query and Report messages are
source independent. The root lists exactly once each multicast address
for which it has at least one active multicast DAO state, copying the
multicast address in the DAO state in the Multicast Address field of the
Multicast Address Records in the Report
message.[¶](#section-10-11){.pilcrow}

This is illustrated in [Figure
12](#fReg4){.xref}:[¶](#section-10-12){.pilcrow}

## [11.](#section-11){.section-number .selfRef} [Security Considerations](#name-security-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-security-considerations}

It is worth noting that with \[[RFC6550](#RFC6550){.xref}\], every node
in the LLN is RPL aware and can inject any RPL-based attack in the
network. This specification improves this situation by isolating edge
nodes that can only interact with the RPL routers using 6LoWPAN ND,
meaning that they cannot perform RPL insider
attacks.[¶](#section-11-1){.pilcrow}

The LLN nodes depend on the 6LBR and the RPL participants for their
operation. A trust model must be put in place to ensure that the right
devices are acting in these roles, so as to avoid such threats as
black-holing (see [Section
7](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7416#section-7){.relref} of
\[[RFC7416](#RFC7416){.xref}\]), DoS attacks whereby a rogue 6LR creates
a high churn in the RPL network by advertising and removing many forged
addresses, or a bombing attack whereby an impersonated 6LBR would
destroy state in the network by using a status code of 4 (\"Removed\")
\[[RFC8505](#RFC8505){.xref}\].[¶](#section-11-2){.pilcrow}

This trust model could be, at a minimum, based on Layer 2 secure joining
and link-layer security. This is a generic 6LoWPAN requirement; see
Req-5.1 in [Appendix
B.5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8505#appendix-B.5){.relref} of
\[[RFC8505](#RFC8505){.xref}\].[¶](#section-11-3){.pilcrow}

In a general manner, the Security Considerations sections of
\[[RFC6550](#RFC6550){.xref}\], \[[RFC7416](#RFC7416){.xref}\],
\[[RFC6775](#RFC6775){.xref}\], and \[[RFC8505](#RFC8505){.xref}\] apply
to this specification as well.[¶](#section-11-4){.pilcrow}

In particular, link-layer security is needed to prevent DoS attacks
whereby a rogue 6LN creates a high churn in the RPL network by
constantly registering and deregistering addresses with the R flag set
to 1 in the EARO.[¶](#section-11-5){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC8928](#RFC8928){.xref}\] updated 6LoWPAN ND with AP-ND. AP-ND
protects the owner of an address against address theft and impersonation
attacks in an LLN. Nodes supporting the extension compute a
cryptographic identifier (Crypto-ID) and use it with one or more of
their Registered Addresses. The Crypto-ID identifies the owner of the
Registered Address and can be used to provide proof of ownership of the
Registered Addresses. Once an address is registered with the Crypto‑ID
and proof of ownership is provided, only the owner of that address can
modify the registration information, thereby enforcing SAVI.
\[[RFC8928](#RFC8928){.xref}\] reduces even further the attack perimeter
that is available to the edge nodes, and its use is suggested in this
specification.[¶](#section-11-6){.pilcrow}

Additionally, the trust model could include role validation (e.g., using
role-based authorization) to ensure that the node that claims to be a
6LBR or a RPL DODAG root is entitled to do
so.[¶](#section-11-7){.pilcrow}

The Opaque field in the EARO enables the RUL to suggest a RPLInstanceID
where its traffic is placed. It is also possible for an attacker RUL to
include an RPI in the packet. This opens the door to attacks where a RPL
Instance would be reserved for critical traffic, e.g., with a specific
bandwidth reservation, that the additional traffic generated by a rogue
may disrupt. The attack may be alleviated by traditional access control
and traffic-shaping mechanisms where the 6LR controls the incoming
traffic from the 6LN. More importantly, the 6LR is the node that injects
the traffic in the RPL domain, so it has the final word on which RPL
Instance is to be used for the traffic coming from the RUL, per its own
policy. In particular, a policy can override the formal language that
forces the use of the Opaque field or the rewriting of the RPI provided
by the RUL, in a situation where the network administrator finds it
relevant.[¶](#section-11-8){.pilcrow}

At the time of this writing, RPL does not have a route ownership
validation model whereby it is possible to validate the origin of an
address that is injected in a DAO. This specification makes a first step
in that direction by allowing the root to challenge the RUL via the 6LR
that serves it.[¶](#section-11-9){.pilcrow}

[Section 6.1](#tgt){.xref} indicates that when the length of the ROVR
field is unknown, the RPL Target option must be passed on as received in
RPL Storing mode. This creates a possible opening for using DAO messages
as a covert channel. Note that DAO messages are rare, and overusing that
channel could be detected. An implementation [SHOULD]{.bcp14} notify the
network management system when a RPL Target option is received with an
unknown ROVR field size, to ensure that the network administrator is
aware of the situation.[¶](#section-11-10){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC9009](#RFC9009){.xref}\] introduces the ability for a rogue common
ancestor node to invalidate a route on behalf of the target node. In
this case, the RPL Status in the DCO has the \'A\' flag set to 0, and an
NA(EARO) is returned to the 6LN with the R flag set to 0. This
encourages the 6LN to try another 6LR. If a 6LR exists that does not use
the rogue common ancestor, then the 6LN will eventually succeed gaining
reachability over the RPL network in spite of the rogue
node.[¶](#section-11-11){.pilcrow}

[Figure 13](#figure-13){.selfRef}: [Encapsulation to Parent 6LR in
Storing Mode](#name-encapsulation-to-parent-6lr){.selfRef}
:::

The difference from the example presented in Figure 19 of
\[[RFC8138](#RFC8138){.xref}\] is the addition of an SRH-6LoRH before
the RPI-6LoRH to transport the compressed address of the 6LR as the
destination address of the outer IPv6 header. In Figure 19 of
\[[RFC8138](#RFC8138){.xref}\], the destination IP of the outer header
was elided and was implicitly the same address as the destination of the
inner header. Type 1 was arbitrarily chosen, and the size of 0 denotes a
single address in the SRH.[¶](#section-appendix.a-3){.pilcrow}

In [Figure 13](#rtghc){.xref}, the source of the IPv6-in-IPv6
encapsulation is the root, so it is elided in the IPv6-in-IPv6 6LoRH.
The destination is the parent 6LR of the destination of the encapsulated
packet, so it cannot be elided. If the DODAG is operated in Storing
mode, it is the single entry in the SRH-6LoRH and the SRH-6LoRH Size is
encoded as 0. The SRH-6LoRH is the first 6LoRH in the chain. In this
particular example, the 6LR address can be compressed to 2 bytes, so a
Type of 1 is used. The result is that the total length of the SRH-6LoRH
is 4 bytes.[¶](#section-appendix.a-4){.pilcrow}

In Non-Storing mode, the encapsulation from the root would be similar to
that represented in [Figure 13](#rtghc){.xref} with possibly more hops
in the SRH‑6LoRH and possibly multiple SRH-6LoRHs if the various
addresses in the routing header are not compressed to the same format.
Note that on the last hop to the parent 6LR, the RH3 is consumed and
removed from the compressed form, so the use of Non-Storing mode
vs. Storing mode is indistinguishable from the packet
format.[¶](#section-appendix.a-5){.pilcrow}

The SRH-6LoRHs are followed by the RPI-6LoRH and then the IPv6-in-IPv6
6LoRH. When the IPv6-in-IPv6 6LoRH is removed, all the 6LoRH Headers
that precede it are also removed. The Paging Dispatch
\[[RFC8025](#RFC8025){.xref}\] may also be removed if there was no
previous Page change to a Page other than 0 or 1, since the LOWPAN_IPHC
is encoded in the same fashion in the default Page 0 and in Page 1. The
resulting packet to the destination is the encapsulated packet
compressed per
\[[RFC6282](#RFC6282){.xref}\].[¶](#section-appendix.a-6){.pilcrow}
