# Deployment Considerations for Information-Centric Networking (ICN) {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

Information-Centric Networking (ICN) is now reaching technological
maturity after many years of fundamental research and experimentation.
This document provides a number of deployment considerations in the
interest of helping the ICN community move forward to the next step of
live deployments. First, the major deployment configurations for ICN are
described, including the key overlay and underlay approaches. Then,
proposed deployment migration paths are outlined to address major
practical issues, such as network and application migration. Next,
selected ICN trial experiences are summarized. Finally, protocol areas
that require further standardization are identified to facilitate future
interoperable ICN deployments. This document is a product of the
Information-Centric Networking Research Group
(ICNRG).[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

The ICNRG charter identifies deployment guidelines as an important topic
area for the ICN community. Specifically, the charter states that
defining concrete migration paths for ICN deployments that avoid
forklift upgrades and defining practical ICN interworking configurations
with the existing Internet paradigm are key topic areas that require
further investigation \[[ICNRGCharter](#ICNRGCharter){.xref}\]. Also, it
is well understood that results and conclusions from any mid- to
large-scale ICN experiments in the live Internet will also provide
useful guidance for deployments.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

So far, outside of some preliminary investigations, such as
\[[ICN-DEP-CON](#I-D.paik-icn-deployment-considerations){.xref}\], there
has not been much progress on this topic. This document attempts to fill
some of these gaps by defining clear deployment configurations for ICN
and associated migration pathways for these configurations. Also,
selected deployment trial experiences of ICN technology are summarized.
Recommendations are also made for potential future IETF standardization
of key protocol functionality that will facilitate interoperable ICN
deployments going forward.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

The major configurations of possible ICN deployments are identified in
this document as (1) Clean-slate ICN replacement of existing Internet
infrastructure, (2) ICN-as-an-Overlay, (3) ICN-as-an-Underlay, (4)
ICN-as-a-Slice, and (5) Composite-ICN. Existing ICN trial systems
primarily fall under the ICN-as-an-Overlay, ICN-as-an-Underlay, and
Composite-ICN configurations. Each of these deployment configurations
have their respective strengths and weaknesses. This document will aim
to provide guidance for current and future members of the ICN community
when they consider deployment of ICN
technologies.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

This document represents the consensus of the Information-Centric
Networking Research Group (ICNRG). It has been reviewed extensively by
the Research Group (RG) members active in the specific areas of work
covered by the document.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

This document assumes readers are, in general, familiar with the terms
and concepts that are defined in \[[RFC7927](#RFC7927){.xref}\] and
\[[ICN-TERM](#I-D.irtf-icnrg-terminology){.xref}\]. In addition, this
document defines the following terminology:[¶](#section-2-1){.pilcrow}

Deployment:
:   The final stage of the process of setting up an ICN network that
    is (1) ready for useful work (e.g., transmission of end-user video
    and text) in a live environment and (2) integrated and interoperable
    with the Internet. We consider the Internet in its widest sense
    where it encompasses various access networks (e.g., Wi-Fi or mobile
    radio network), service edge networks (e.g., for edge computing),
    transport networks, Content Distribution Networks (CDNs), core
    networks (e.g., mobile core network), and back-end processing
    networks (e.g., data centers). However, throughout this document,
    the discussion is typically limited to edge networks, core networks,
    and CDNs, for simplicity.[¶](#section-2-2.2){.pilcrow}
:   

Information-Centric Networking (ICN):
:   A data-centric network architecture where accessing data by name is
    the essential network primitive. See
    \[[ICN-TERM](#I-D.irtf-icnrg-terminology){.xref}\] for further
    information.[¶](#section-2-2.4){.pilcrow}
:   

Network Functions Virtualization (NFV):
:   A networking approach where network functions (e.g., firewalls or
    load balancers) are modularized as software logic that can run on
    general purpose hardware and, thus, are specifically decoupled from
    the previous generation of proprietary and dedicated hardware. See
    \[[RFC8568](#RFC8568){.xref}\] for further
    information.[¶](#section-2-2.6){.pilcrow}
:   

Software-Defined Networking (SDN):
:   A networking approach where the control and data planes for switches
    are separated, allowing for realizing capabilities, such as traffic
    isolation and programmable forwarding actions. See
    \[[RFC7426](#RFC7426){.xref}\] for further
    information.[¶](#section-2-2.8){.pilcrow}

## [4.](#section-4){.section-number .selfRef} [Deployment Configurations](#name-deployment-configurations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-deployment-configurations}

In this section, we present various deployment options for ICN. These
are presented as \"configurations\" that allow for studying these
options further. While this document will outline experiences with a
number of these configurations (in [Section
6](#sec_trial_experiences){.xref}), we will not provide an in-depth
technical or commercial evaluation for any of them \-- for this, we
refer to existing literature in this space, such as

### [4.1.](#section-4.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Clean-Slate ICN](#name-clean-slate-icn){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-clean-slate-icn}

ICN has often been described as a \"clean-slate\" approach with the goal
to renew or replace the complete IP infrastructure of the Internet. As
such, existing routing hardware and ancillary services, such as existing
applications that are typically tied directly to the TCP/IP stack, are
not taken for granted. For instance, a Clean-slate ICN deployment would
see existing IP routers being replaced by ICN-specific forwarding and
routing elements, such as NFD \[[NFD](#NFD){.xref}\], CCNx routers
\[[Jacobson](#Jacobson){.xref}\], or Publish-Subscribe Internet
Technology (PURSUIT) forwarding nodes
\[[IEEE_Communications](#IEEE_Communications){.xref}\].[¶](#section-4.1-1){.pilcrow}

While such clean-slate replacement could be seen as exclusive for ICN
deployments, some ICN approaches (e.g., \[[POINT](#POINT){.xref}\]) also
rely on the deployment of general infrastructure upgrades, in this case,
SDN switches. Different proposals have been made for various ICN
approaches to enable the operation over an SDN transport

### [4.2.](#section-4.2){.section-number .selfRef} [ICN-as-an-Overlay](#name-icn-as-an-overlay){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-icn-as-an-overlay}

Similar to other significant changes to the Internet routing fabric,
particularly the transition from IPv4 to IPv6 or the introduction of IP
multicast, this deployment configuration foresees the creation of an ICN
overlay. Note that this overlay approach is sometimes, informally, also
referred to as a tunneling approach. The overlay approach can be
implemented directly (e.g., ICN-over-UDP), as described in
\[[CCNx_UDP](#CCNx_UDP){.xref}\]. Alternatively, the overlay can be
accomplished via ICN-in-L2-in-IP as in
\[[IEEE_Communications](#IEEE_Communications){.xref}\], which describes
a recursive layering process. Another approach used in the Network of
Information (NetInf) is to define a convergence layer to map NetInf
semantics to HTTP \[[NetInf](#I-D.kutscher-icnrg-netinf-proto){.xref}\].
Finally, \[[Overlay_ICN](#Overlay_ICN){.xref}\] describes an incremental
approach to deploying an ICN architecture particularly well suited to
SDN-based networks by also segregating ICN user- and control-plane
traffic.[¶](#section-4.2-1){.pilcrow}

However, regardless of the flavor, the overlay approach results in
islands of ICN deployments over existing IP-based infrastructure.
Furthermore, these ICN islands are typically connected to each other via
ICN/IP tunnels. In certain scenarios, this requires interoperability
between existing IP routing protocols (e.g., OSPF, RIP, or IS-IS) and
ICN-based ones. ICN-as-an-Overlay can be deployed over the IP
infrastructure in either edge or core networks. This overlay approach is
thus very attractive for ICN experimentation and testing, as it allows
rapid and easy deployment of ICN over existing IP
networks.[¶](#section-4.2-2){.pilcrow}

Proposals, such as \[[POINT](#POINT){.xref}\] and
\[[White](#White){.xref}\], outline the deployment option of using an
ICN underlay that would integrate with existing (external) IP-based
networks by deploying application-layer gateways at appropriate
locations. The main reasons for such a configuration option is the
introduction of ICN technology in given islands (e.g., inside a CDN or
edge IoT network) to reap the benefits of native ICN, in terms of
underlying multicast delivery, mobility support, fast indirection due to
location independence, in-network computing, and possibly more. The
underlay approach thus results in islands of native ICN deployments that
are connected to the rest of the Internet through protocol conversion
gateways or proxies. Routing domains are strictly separated. Outside of
the ICN island, normal IP routing protocols apply. Within the ICN
island, ICN-based routing schemes apply. The gateways transfer the
semantic content of the messages (i.e., IP packet payload) between the
two routing domains.[¶](#section-4.3-1){.pilcrow}

::: {#sec_application_gateways}

#### [4.3.1.](#section-4.3.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Edge Network](#name-edge-network){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-edge-network}

Native ICN networks may be located at the edge of the network where the
introduction of new network architectures and protocols is easier in
so-called greenfield deployments. In this context, ICN is an attractive
option for scenarios, such as IoT
\[[ICN-IoT](#I-D.irtf-icnrg-icniot){.xref}\]. The integration with the
current IP protocol suite takes place at an application gateway/proxy at
the edge network boundary, e.g., translating incoming CoAP
request/response transactions \[[RFC7252](#RFC7252){.xref}\] into ICN
message exchanges or vice versa.[¶](#section-4.3.1-1){.pilcrow}

The work in \[[VSER](#VSER){.xref}\] positions ICN as an edge service
gateway driven by a generalized ICN-based service orchestration system
with its own compute and network virtualization controllers to manage an
ICN infrastructure. The platform also offers service discovery
capabilities to enable user applications to discover appropriate ICN
service gateways. To exemplify a scenario in a use case, the
\[[VSER](#VSER){.xref}\] platform shows the realization of a multi-party
audio/video conferencing service over such an edge cloud deployment of
ICN routers realized over commodity hardware platforms. This platform
has also been extended to offer seamless mobility as a service that
\[[VSER-Mob](#VSER-Mob){.xref}\]
features.[¶](#section-4.3.1-2){.pilcrow}

#### [4.3.2.](#section-4.3.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Core Network](#name-core-network){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-core-network}

In this suboption, a core network would utilize edge-based protocol
mapping onto the native ICN underlay. For instance,
\[[POINT](#POINT){.xref}\] proposes to map HTTP transactions or some
other IP-based transactions, such as CoAP, directly onto an ICN-based
message exchange. This mapping is realized at the NAP, for example, in
access points or customer premise equipment, which, in turn, provides a
standard IP interface to existing user devices. Thus, the NAP provides
the apparent perception of an IP-based core network toward any external
peering network.[¶](#section-4.3.2-1){.pilcrow}

The work in \[[White](#White){.xref}\] proposes a similar deployment
configuration. There, the goal is to use ICN for content distribution
within CDN server farms. Specifically, the protocol mapping is realized
at the ingress of the server farm where the HTTP-based retrieval request
is served, while the response is delivered through a suitable egress
node translation.[¶](#section-4.3.2-2){.pilcrow}

### [4.4.](#section-4.4){.section-number .selfRef} [ICN-as-a-Slice](#name-icn-as-a-slice){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-icn-as-a-slice}

The objective of network slicing \[[NGMN-5G](#NGMN-5G){.xref}\] is to
multiplex a general pool of compute, storage, and bandwidth resources
among multiple service networks with exclusive SLA requirements on
transport and compute-level QoS and security. This is enabled through
NFV and SDN technology functions that enable functional decomposition
(hence, modularity, independent scalability of control, and/or the
user-plane functions), agility, and service-driven programmability.
Network slicing is often associated with 5G but is clearly not limited
to such systems. However, from a 5G perspective, the definition of
slicing includes access networks enabling dynamic slicing of the
spectrum resources among various services, hence naturally extending
itself to end points and cloud resources across multiple domains, to
offer end-to-end guarantees. Once instantiated, these slices could
include a mix of connectivity services (e.g., LTE-as-a-service),
Over-the-Top (OTT) services (e.g., VoD), or other IoT services through
composition of a group of virtual and/or physical network functions at
the control-, user-, and service-plane levels. Such a framework can also
be used to realize ICN slices with its own control and forwarding plane,
over which one or more end-user services can be delivered
\[[NGMN-Network-Slicing](#NGMN-Network-Slicing){.xref}\].[¶](#section-4.4-1){.pilcrow}

The 5G next generation architecture
\[[fiveG-23501](#fiveG-23501){.xref}\] provides the flexibility to
deploy the ICN-as-a-Slice over either the edge (RAN) or mobile core
network; otherwise, the ICN-as-a-Slice may be deployed end to end.
Further discussions on extending the architecture presented in
\[[fiveG-23501](#fiveG-23501){.xref}\] and the corresponding procedures
in \[[fiveG-23502](#fiveG-23502){.xref}\] to support ICN has been
provided in \[[ICN-5GC](#I-D.ravi-icnrg-5gc-icn){.xref}\]. The document
elaborates on two possible approaches to enable ICN: (1) as an edge
service using the local data network (LDN) feature in 5G using User
Plane Function (UPF) classification functions to fast handover to the
ICN forwarder and (2) as a native deployment using the non-IP Protocol
Data Unit (PDU) support that would allow new network layer PDU to be
handed over to ICN UPFs collocated with the Generation NodeB (gNB)
functions without invoking any IP functions. While the former deployment
would still rely on 3GPP-based mobility functions, the later would allow
mobility to be handled natively by ICN. However, both these deployment
modes should benefit from other ICN features, such as in-network caching
and computing. Associated with this ICN user-plane enablement,
control-plane extensions are also proposed leveraging 5th Generation
Core Network (5GC)\'s interface to other application functions (AFs) to
allow new network service-level programmability. Such a generalized
network slicing framework should be able to offer service slices over
both IP and ICN. Coupled with the view of ICN functions as being
\"service function chaining\" \[[RFC7665](#RFC7665){.xref}\], an ICN
deployment within such a slice could also be realized within the
emerging control plane that is targeted for adoption in future (e.g., 5G
mobile) network deployments. Finally, it should be noted that ICN is not
creating the network slice but instead that the slice is created to run
a 5G-ICN instance
\[[Ravindran](#Ravindran){.xref}\].[¶](#section-4.4-2){.pilcrow}

At the level of the specific technologies involved, such as ONAP
\[[ONAP](#ONAP){.xref}\] (which can be used to orchestrate slices), the
5G-ICN slice requires compatibility, for instance, at the level of the
forwarding/data plane depending on if it is realized as an overlay or
using programmable data planes. With SDN emerging for new network
deployments, some ICN approaches will need to integrate as a data-plane
forwarding function with SDN, as briefly discussed in [Section
4.1](#sec_replacements){.xref}. Further cross-domain ICN slices can also
be realized using frameworks, such as
\[[ONAP](#ONAP){.xref}\].[¶](#section-4.4-3){.pilcrow}

### [4.5.](#section-4.5){.section-number .selfRef} [Composite-ICN Approach](#name-composite-icn-approach){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-composite-icn-approach}

Some deployments do not clearly correspond to any of the previously
defined basic configurations of (1) Clean-slate ICN, (2)
ICN-as-an-Overlay, (3) ICN-as-an-Underlay, and (4) ICN-as-a-Slice. Or, a
deployment may contain a composite mixture of the properties of these
basic configurations. For example, the Hybrid ICN
\[[H-ICN_1](#H-ICN_1){.xref}\] approach carries ICN names in existing
IPv6 headers and does not have distinct gateways or tunnels connecting
ICN islands or any other distinct feature identified in the previous
basic configurations. So we categorize Hybrid ICN and other approaches
that do not clearly correspond to one of the other basic configurations
as a Composite-ICN approach.[¶](#section-4.5-1){.pilcrow}

## [5.](#section-5){.section-number .selfRef} [Deployment Migration Paths](#name-deployment-migration-paths){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-deployment-migration-paths}

We now focus on the various migration paths that will have importance to
the various stakeholders that are usually involved in the deployment of
ICN networks. We can identify these stakeholders
as:[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

-   [application providers[¶](#section-5-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-5-2.1}
-   [ISPs and service providers, both as core and access network
    providers, as well as ICN network
    providers[¶](#section-5-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-5-2.2}
-   [CDN providers (due to the strong relation of the ICN proposition to

-   [end-device manufacturers and
    users[¶](#section-5-2.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-5-2.4}

Our focus is on technological aspects of such migration. Economic or
regulatory aspects, such as those studied in
\[[Tateson](#Tateson){.xref}\],
\[[Techno_Economic](#Techno_Economic){.xref}\], and
\[[Internet_Pricing](#Internet_Pricing){.xref}\], are left out of our
discussion.[¶](#section-5-3){.pilcrow}

### [5.1.](#section-5.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Application and Service Migration](#name-application-and-service-mig){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-application-and-service-mig}

The Internet supports a multitude of applications and services using the
many protocols defined over the packet-level IP service. HTTP provides
one convergence point for these services with many web development
frameworks based on the semantics provided by it. In recent years, even
services such as video delivery have been migrating from the traditional
RTP-over-UDP delivery to the various HTTP-level streaming solutions,
such as DASH \[[DASH](#DASH){.xref}\] and others. Nonetheless, many
non-HTTP services exist, all of which need consideration when migrating
from the IP-based Internet to an ICN-based
one.[¶](#section-5.1-1){.pilcrow}

The underlay deployment configuration option presented in [Section
4.3](#sec_underlay){.xref} aims at providing some level of compatibility
to the existing ecosystem through a proxy-based message flow mapping
mechanism (e.g., mapping of existing HTTP/TCP/IP message flows to
HTTP/ICN message flows). A related approach of mapping TCP/IP to TCP/ICN
message flows is described in \[[Moiseenko](#Moiseenko){.xref}\].
Another approach described in \[[Marchal](#Marchal){.xref}\] uses
HTTP/NDN gateways and focuses, in particular, on the right strategy to
map HTTP to NDN to guarantee a high level of compatibility with HTTP
while enabling an efficient caching of data in the ICN island. The
choice of approach is a design decision based on how to configure the
protocol stack. For example, the approach described in
\[[Moiseenko](#Moiseenko){.xref}\] carries the TCP layer into the ICN
underlay, while the \[[Marchal](#Marchal){.xref}\] approach terminates
both HTTP and TCP at the edge of the ICN underlay and maps these
functionalities onto existing ICN
functionalities.[¶](#section-5.1-2){.pilcrow}

Alternatively, ICN-as-an-Overlay ([Section 4.2](#sec_overlay){.xref})
and ICN-as-a-Slice ([Section 4.4](#sec_icn_slice){.xref}) allow for the
introduction of the full capabilities of ICN through new
application/service interfaces, as well as operations in the network.
With that, these approaches of deployment are likely to aim at
introducing new application/services capitalizing on those ICN
capabilities, such as in-network multicast and/or
caching.[¶](#section-5.1-3){.pilcrow}

Finally, \[[ICN-LTE-4G](#I-D.irtf-icnrg-icn-lte-4g){.xref}\] outlines a
dual-stack end-user device approach that is applicable for all
deployment configurations. Specifically, it introduces middleware layers
(called the TCL) in the device that will dynamically adapt existing
applications to either an underlying ICN protocol stack or standard IP
protocol stack. This involves end device signaling with the network to
determine which protocol stack instance and associated middleware
adaptation layers to utilize for a given application
transaction.[¶](#section-5.1-4){.pilcrow}

### [5.2.](#section-5.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Content Delivery Network Migration](#name-content-delivery-network-mi){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-content-delivery-network-mi}

A significant number of services and applications are devoted to content
delivery in some form, e.g., as video delivery, social media platforms,
and many others. CDNs are deployed to assist these services through
localizing the content requests and therefore reducing latency and
possibly increasing utilization of available bandwidth, as well as
reducing the load on origin servers. Similar to the previous subsection,
the underlay deployment configuration presented in [Section
4.3](#sec_underlay){.xref} aims at providing a migration path for
existing CDNs. This is also highlighted in a BIER use-case document
\[[BIER](#I-D.ietf-bier-multicast-http-response){.xref}\], specifically
with potential benefits in terms of utilizing multicast in the delivery
of content but also reducing load on origin and delegation servers. We
return to this benefit in the trial experiences in [Section

### [5.3.](#section-5.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Edge Network Migration](#name-edge-network-migration){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-edge-network-migration}

Edge networks often see the deployment of novel network-level
technology, e.g., in the space of IoT. For many years, such IoT
deployments have relied, and often still do, on proprietary protocols
for reasons, such as increased efficiency, lack of standardization
incentives, and others. Utilizing the underlay deployment configuration
in [Section 4.3.1](#sec_application_gateways){.xref}, application
gateways/proxies can integrate such edge deployments into IP-based
services, e.g., utilizing CoAP-based \[[RFC7252](#RFC7252){.xref}\] M2M
platforms, such as oneM2M \[[oneM2M](#oneM2M){.xref}\] or
others.[¶](#section-5.3-1){.pilcrow}

Another area of increased edge network innovation is that of mobile
(access) networks, particularly in the context of the 5G mobile
networks. Network softwarization (using technologies like service
orchestration frameworks leveraging NFV and SDN concepts) are now common
in access networks and other network segments. Therefore, the
ICN-as-a-Slice deployment configuration in [Section
4.4](#sec_icn_slice){.xref} provides a suitable migration path for the
integration of non-IP-based edge networks into the overall system by
virtue of realizing the relevant (ICN) protocols in an access network
slice.[¶](#section-5.3-2){.pilcrow}

With the advent of SDN and NFV capabilities, so-called campus or
site-specific deployments could see the introduction of ICN islands at
the edge for scenarios such as gaming or deployments based on Augmented
Reality (AR) / Virtual Reality (VR), e.g., smart cities or theme
parks.[¶](#section-5.3-3){.pilcrow}

Migrating core networks of the Internet or mobile networks requires not
only significant infrastructure renewal but also the fulfillment of the
key performance requirements, particularly in terms of throughput. For
those parts of the core network that would migrate to an SDN-based
optical transport, the ICN-as-a-Slice deployment configuration in
[Section 4.4](#sec_icn_slice){.xref} would allow the introduction of
native ICN solutions within slices. This would allow for isolating the
ICN traffic while addressing the specific ICN performance benefits (such
as in-network multicast or caching) and constraints (such as the need
for specific network elements within such isolated slices). For ICN
solutions that natively work on top of SDN, the underlay deployment
configuration in [Section 4.3.2](#sec_http_ip){.xref} provides an
additional migration path, preserving the IP-based services and
applications at the edge of the network while realizing the core network
routing through an ICN solution (possibly itself realized in a slice of
the SDN transport network).[¶](#section-5.4-1){.pilcrow}

ICN2020 is an ICN-related project of the EU H2020 research program and
NICT \[[ICN2020-overview](#ICN2020-overview){.xref}\]. ICN2020 has a
specific focus to advance ICN towards real-world deployments through

UMOBILE is another of the ICN research projects under the H2020 research
program \[[UMOBILE-overview](#UMOBILE-overview){.xref}\]. The UMOBILE
architecture integrates the principles of DTN and ICN in a common
framework to support edge computing and mobile opportunistic wireless
environments (e.g., post-disaster scenarios and remote areas). The
UMOBILE architecture \[[UMOBILE-2](#UMOBILE-2){.xref}\] was developed on
top of the NDN framework by following the overlay deployment
configuration of [Section 4.2](#sec_overlay){.xref}. UMOBILE aims to
extend Internet functionally by combining ICN and DTN
technologies.[¶](#section-6.1.5-1){.pilcrow}

One of the key aspects of UMOBILE was the extension of the NDN framework
to locate network services (e.g., mobility management and intermittent
connectivity support) and user services (e.g., pervasive content
management) as close as possible to the end users to optimize bandwidth
utilization and resource management. Another aspect was the evolution of
the NDN framework to operate in challenging wireless networks, namely in
emergency scenarios \[[UMOBILE-3](#UMOBILE-3){.xref}\] and environments
with intermittent connectivity. To achieve this, the NDN framework was
leveraged with a new messaging application called Oi!
\[[UMOBILE-4](#UMOBILE-4){.xref}\] \[[UMOBILE-5](#UMOBILE-5){.xref}\],
which supports intermittent wireless networking. UMOBILE also implements
a new data-centric wireless routing protocol, DABBER
\[[UMOBILE-6](#UMOBILE-6){.xref}\]
\[[DABBER](#I-D.mendes-icnrg-dabber){.xref}\], which was designed based
on data reachability metrics that take availability of adjacent wireless
nodes and different data sources into consideration. The contextual
awareness of the wireless network operation is obtained via a
machine-learning agent running within the wireless nodes
\[[UMOBILE-7](#UMOBILE-7){.xref}\].[¶](#section-6.1.5-2){.pilcrow}

The consortium has completed several ICN deployment trials. In a
post-disaster scenario trial \[[UMOBILE-8](#UMOBILE-8){.xref}\], a
special DTN face was created to provide reachability to remote areas
where there is no typical Internet connection. Another trial was the ICN
deployment over the \"Guifi.net\" community network in the Barcelona
region. This trial focused on the evaluation of an ICN edge computing
platform, called PiCasso \[[UMOBILE-9](#UMOBILE-9){.xref}\]. In this
trial, ten (10) Raspberry Pis were deployed across Barcelona to create
an ICN overlay network on top of the existing IP routing protocol (e.g.,
qMp routing). This trial showed that ICN can play a key role in
improving data delivery QoS and reducing the traffic in intermittent
connectivity environments (e.g., wireless community network). A third
trial in Italy was focused on displaying the capability of the UMOBILE
architecture to reach disconnected areas and assist responsible
authorities in emergencies, corresponding to an infrastructure scenario.
The demonstration encompassed seven (7) end-user devices, one (1) access
point, and one (1) gateway.[¶](#section-6.1.5-3){.pilcrow}

research program. The efforts in the H2020 POINT and RIFE projects
follow the underlay deployment configuration in [Section
4.3.2](#sec_http_ip){.xref}; edge-based NAPs provide the IP/HTTP-level
protocol mapping onto ICN protocol exchanges, while the SDN underlay (or
the VPN-based L2 underlay) is used as a transport
network.[¶](#section-6.2.1-1){.pilcrow}

The multicast and service endpoint surrogate benefit in HTTP-based
scenarios, such as for HTTP-level streaming video delivery, and have
been demonstrated in the deployed POINT testbed with 80+ nodes being
utilized. Demonstrations of this capability have been given to the
ICNRG, and public demonstrations were also provided at events
\[[MWC_Demo](#MWC_Demo){.xref}\]. The trial has also been accepted by
the ETSI MEC group as a public proof-of-concept

While the aforementioned demonstrations all use the overlay deployment,
H2020 also has performed ICN underlay trials. One such trial involved
commercial end users located in the PrimeTel network in Cyprus with the
use case centered on IPTV and HLS video dissemination. Another trial was
performed over the \"Guifi.net\" community network in the Barcelona
region, where the solution was deployed in 40 households, providing
general Internet connectivity to the residents. Standard IPTV Set-Top

were conducted with the city/university joint venture Bristol-is-Open
(BIO) to ensure the readiness of the city-scale SDN transport network
for such experiments. Another trial was for the ETSI MEC PoC. This trial
showcased operational benefits provided by the ICN underlay for the
scenario of a location-based game. These benefits aim at reduced network
utilization through improved video delivery performance (multicast of
all captured videos to the service surrogates deployed in the city at
six locations), as well as reduced latency through the play out of the
video originating from the local NAP, collocated with the Wi-Fi Access
Point (AP) instead of a remote server, i.e., the playout latency was
bounded by the maximum single-hop
latency.[¶](#section-6.2.2-1){.pilcrow}

part of the H2020 FLAME efforts in the area of Future Media Internet

The data plane relies on an HTTP/NDN gateway
\[[Marchal](#Marchal){.xref}\] that processes HTTP traffic and
transports it in an optimized way over NDN to benefit from the
properties of the NDN island (i.e., by mapping HTTP semantics to NDN
semantics within the NDN island). The testbed carries real Web traffic

websites. The users only need to set the gateway as the web proxy. The
control plane relies on a central manager that uses

intent is to enable rapid hybrid deployments and seamless
interconnection of IP and Hybrid ICN domains. Hybrid ICN uses

In summary, there have been significant trials over the years with all
the major ICN protocol flavors (e.g., CCNx, NDN, and POINT) using both
the ICN-as-an-Overlay and ICN-as-an-Underlay deployment configurations.
The major limitations of the trials include the fact that only a limited
number of applications have been tested. However, the tested
applications include both native ICN and existing IP-based applications
(e.g., videoconferencing and IPTV). Another limitation of the trials is
that all of them involve less than 1k
users.[¶](#section-6.4-1){.pilcrow}

Huawei and China Unicom have just started trials of the ICN-as-a-Slice
configuration to demonstrate ICN features of security, mobility, and
bandwidth efficiency over a wired infrastructure using videoconferencing
as the application scenario \[[Chakraborti](#Chakraborti){.xref}\];
also, this prototype has been extended to demonstrate this over a 5G-NR
access.[¶](#section-6.4-2){.pilcrow}

The Clean-slate ICN approach has obviously never been in trials, as
complete replacement of Internet infrastructure (e.g., existing
applications, TCP/IP protocol stack, IP routers, etc.) is no longer
considered a viable alternative.[¶](#section-6.4-3){.pilcrow}

Finally, Hybrid ICN is a Composite-ICN approach that offers an
interesting alternative, as it allows ICN semantics to be embedded in
standard IPv6 packets so the packets can be routed through either IP
routers or Hybrid ICN routers. Note that some other trials, such as the
DOCTOR testbed ([Section 6.2.6](#sec_Doctor){.xref}), could also be
characterized as a Composite-ICN approach, because it contains both ICN
gateways (as in ICN-as-an-Underlay) and virtualized infrastructure (as
in ICN-as-a-Slice). However, for the DOCTOR testbed, we have chosen to
characterize it as an ICN-as-an-Underlay configuration because that is a
dominant characteristic.[¶](#section-6.4-4){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC7927](#RFC7927){.xref}\] is research oriented without a specific

relevant for further standardization effort in the IETF. The focus is
specifically on identifying protocols that will facilitate future

End-user applications and services need a standardized approach to
trigger ICN transactions. For example, in Internet and web applications
today, there are established socket APIs, communication paradigms (such
as REST), common libraries, and best practices. We see a need to study

A key issue in CDNs is to quickly find a location of a copy of the
object requested by an end user. In ICN, a Named Data Object (NDO) is
typically defined by its name. \[[RFC6920](#RFC6920){.xref}\] defines a
mechanism that is suitable for static naming of ICN data objects. Other
ways of encoding and representing ICN names have been described in
\[[RFC8609](#RFC8609){.xref}\] and \[[RFC8569](#RFC8569){.xref}\].
Naming dynamically generated data requires different approaches(e.g.,
hash-digest-based names would normally not work), and there is a lack of
established conventions and standards.[¶](#section-7.2-1){.pilcrow}

Another CDN issue for ICN is related to multicast distribution of
content. Existing CDNs have started using multicast mechanisms for
certain cases, such as for broadcasting streaming TV. However, as
discussed in [Section 6.2.1](#sec_point_rife){.xref}, certain ICN
approaches provide substantial improvements over IP multicast, such as
the implicit support for multicast retrieval of content in all ICN
flavors.[¶](#section-7.2-2){.pilcrow}

Caching is an implicit feature in many ICN architectures that can
improve performance and availability in several scenarios. The ICN
in-network caching can augment managed CDN and improve its performance.
The details of the interplay between ICN caching and managed CDN need
further consideration.[¶](#section-7.2-3){.pilcrow}

ICN provides the potential to redesign current edge and core network
computing approaches. Leveraging ICN\'s inherent security and its
ability to make name data and dynamic computation results available
independent of location can enable a lightweight insertion of traffic
into the network without relying on redirection of DNS requests. For
this, proxies that translate from commonly used protocols in the general
Internet to ICN message exchanges in the ICN domain could be used for
the migration of application and services within deployments at the
network edge but also in core networks. This is similar to existing
approaches for IoT scenarios where a proxy translates CoAP
request/responses to other message formats. For example,
\[[RFC8075](#RFC8075){.xref}\] specifies proxy mapping between CoAP and
HTTP protocols. Also, \[[RFC8613](#RFC8613){.xref}\] is an example of
how to pass end-to-end encrypted content between HTTP and CoAP by an
application-layer security mechanism. Further work is required to
identify if an approach like \[[RFC8613](#RFC8613){.xref}\], or some
other approach, is suitable to preserve ICN message security through
future protocol translation functions of
gateways/proxies.[¶](#section-7.3-1){.pilcrow}

Interaction and interoperability between existing IP routing protocols
(e.g., OSPF, RIP, or IS-IS) and ICN routing approaches (e.g., NFD and
CCNx routers) are expected, especially in the overlay approach. Another
important topic is the integration of ICN into networks that support
virtualized infrastructure in the form of NFV/SDN and most likely
utilize SFC as a key protocol. Further work is required to validate this
idea and document best practices.[¶](#section-7.3-2){.pilcrow}

There are several existing approaches to supporting QoS in IP networks,
including Diffserv, IntServ, and RSVP. Some initial ideas for QoS
support in ICN networks are outlined in
\[[FLOW-CLASS](#I-D.moiseenko-icnrg-flowclass){.xref}\], which proposes
an approach based on flow classification to enable functions, such ICN
rate control and cache control. Also,
\[[ICN-QoS](#I-D.anilj-icnrg-icn-qos){.xref}\] proposes how to use
Diffserv Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) codes to support QoS
for ICN-based data path delivery. Further work is required to identify
the best approaches for support of QoS in ICN
networks.[¶](#section-7.3-3){.pilcrow}

OAM is a crucial area that has not yet been fully addressed by the ICN
research community but which is obviously critical for future
deployments of ICN. Potential areas that need investigation include
whether the YANG data modeling approach and associated NETCONF/RESTCONF
protocols need any specific updates for ICN support. Another open area
is how to measure and benchmark performance of ICN networks comparable
to the sophisticated techniques that exist for standard IP networks,
virtualized networks, and data centers. It should be noted that some
initial progress has been made in the area of ICN network path
traceroute facility with approaches, such as CCNxinfo

This document provides high-level deployment considerations for current
and future members of the ICN community. Specifically, the major
configurations of possible ICN deployments are identified as (1)
Clean-slate ICN replacement of existing Internet infrastructure, (2)
ICN-as-an-Overlay, (3) ICN-as-an-Underlay, (4) ICN-as-a-Slice, and (5)
Composite-ICN. Existing ICN trial systems primarily fall under the
ICN-as-an-Overlay, ICN-as-an-Underlay, and Composite-ICN
configurations.[¶](#section-8-1){.pilcrow}

In terms of deployment migration paths, ICN-as-an-Underlay offers a
clear migration path for CDN, edge, or core networks to go to an ICN
paradigm (e.g., for an IoT deployment) while leaving the critical mass
of existing end-user applications untouched. ICN-as-an-Overlay is the
easiest configuration to deploy rapidly, as it leaves the underlying IP
infrastructure essentially untouched. However, its applicability for
general deployment must be considered on a case-by-case basis. (That is,
can it support all required user applications?). ICN-as-a-Slice is an
attractive deployment option for upcoming 5G systems (i.e., for 5G radio
and core networks) that will naturally support network slicing, but this
still has to be validated through more trial experiences. Composite-ICN,
by its nature, can combine some of the best characteristics of the other
configurations, but its applicability for general deployment must again
be considered on a case-by-case basis (i.e., can enough IP routers be
upgraded to support Composite-ICN functionality to provide sufficient
performance benefits?).[¶](#section-8-2){.pilcrow}

There has been significant trial experience with all the major ICN
protocol flavors (e.g., CCNx, NDN, and POINT). However, only a limited
number of applications have been tested so far, and the maximum number
of users in any given trial has been less than 1k users. It is
recommended that future ICN deployments scale their users gradually and
closely monitor network performance as they go above 1k users. A logical
approach would be to increase the number of users in a slowly increasing
linear manner and monitor network performance and stability, especially
at every multiple of 1k users.[¶](#section-8-3){.pilcrow}

Finally, this document describes a set of technical features in ICN that
warrant potential future IETF specification work. This will aid initial
and incremental deployments to proceed in an interoperable manner. The
fundamental details of the potential protocol specification effort,
however, are best left for future study by the appropriate IETF WGs
and/or BoFs. The ICNRG can aid this process in the near and mid-term by
continuing to examine key system issues like QoS mechanisms, flexible
naming schemes, and OAM support for ICN.[¶](#section-8-4){.pilcrow}

ICN was purposefully designed from the start to have certain intrinsic
security properties. The most well known of which are authentication of
delivered content and (optional) encryption of the content.
\[[RFC7945](#RFC7945){.xref}\] has an extensive discussion of various
aspects of ICN security, including many that are relevant to
deployments. Specifically, \[[RFC7945](#RFC7945){.xref}\] points out
that ICN access control, privacy, security of in-network caches, and
protection against various network attacks (e.g., DoS) have not yet been
fully developed due to the lack of a sufficient mass of deployments.
\[[RFC7945](#RFC7945){.xref}\] also points out relevant advances
occurring in the ICN research community that hold promise to address
each of the identified security gaps. Lastly,
\[[RFC7945](#RFC7945){.xref}\] points out that as secure communications
in the existing Internet (e.g., HTTPS) become the norm, major gaps in
ICN security will inevitably slow down the adoption of
ICN.[¶](#section-10-1){.pilcrow}

In addition to the security findings of \[[RFC7945](#RFC7945){.xref}\],
this document has highlighted that all anticipated ICN deployment
configurations will involve coexistence with existing Internet
infrastructure and applications. Thus, even the basic authentication and
encryption properties of ICN content will need to account for
interworking with non-ICN content to preserve end-to-end security. For
example, in the edge network underlay deployment configuration described
in [Section 4.3.1](#sec_application_gateways){.xref}, the gateway/proxy
that translates HTTP or CoAP request/responses into ICN message
exchanges will need to support a security model to preserve end-to-end
security. One alternative would be to consider an approach similar to
\[[RFC8613](#RFC8613){.xref}\], which is used to pass end-to-end
encrypted content between HTTP and CoAP by an application-layer security
mechanism. Further investigation is required to see if this approach is
suitable to preserve ICN message security through future protocol
translation functions (e.g., ICN to HTTP or CoAP to ICN) of
gateways/proxies.[¶](#section-10-2){.pilcrow}

Finally, the DOCTOR project discussed in [Section
6.2.6](#sec_Doctor){.xref} is an example of an early deployment that is
looking at specific attacks against ICN infrastructure, in this case,
looking at Interest Flooding Attacks \[[Nguyen-2](#Nguyen-2){.xref}\]
and Content Poisoning Attacks \[[Nguyen-1](#Nguyen-1){.xref}\]
\[[Mai-2](#Mai-2){.xref}\] \[[Nguyen-3](#Nguyen-3){.xref}\] and
evaluating potential countermeasures based on MANO-orchestrated actions
on the virtualized infrastructure
\[[Mai-1](#Mai-1){.xref}\].[¶](#section-10-3){.pilcrow}
