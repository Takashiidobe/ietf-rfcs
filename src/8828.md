One of WebRTC\'s key features is its support of peer-to-peer
connections. However, when establishing such a connection, which
involves connection attempts from various IP addresses, WebRTC may allow
a web application to learn additional information about the user
compared to an application that only uses the Hypertext Transfer
Protocol (HTTP) \[[RFC7230](#RFC7230){.xref}\]. This may be problematic
in certain cases. This document summarizes the concerns and makes
recommendations on how WebRTC implementations should best handle the
trade-off between privacy and media
performance.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-3 .section}
## [3.](#section-3){.section-number .selfRef} [Problem Statement](#name-problem-statement){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-problem-statement}

In order to establish a peer-to-peer connection, WebRTC implementations
use Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE)
\[[RFC8445](#RFC8445){.xref}\]. ICE attempts to discover multiple IP
addresses using techniques such as Session Traversal Utilities for NAT
(STUN) \[[RFC5389](#RFC5389){.xref}\] and Traversal Using Relays around
NAT (TURN) \[[RFC5766](#RFC5766){.xref}\] and then checks the
connectivity of each local-address-remote-address pair in order to
select the best one. The addresses that are collected usually consist of
an endpoint\'s private physical or virtual addresses and its public
Internet addresses.[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

These addresses are provided to the web application so that they can be
communicated to the remote endpoint for its checks. This allows the
application to learn more about the local network configuration than it
would from a typical HTTP scenario, in which the web server would only
see a single public Internet address, i.e., the address from which the
HTTP request was sent.[¶](#section-3-2){.pilcrow}

The additional information revealed falls into three
categories:[¶](#section-3-3){.pilcrow}

1.  [If the client is multihomed, additional public IP addresses for the
    client can be learned. In particular, if the client tries to hide
    its physical location through a Virtual Private Network (VPN), and
    the VPN and local OS support routing over multiple interfaces (a
    \"split-tunnel\" VPN), WebRTC can discover not only the public
    address for the VPN, but also the ISP public address over which the
    VPN is running.[¶](#section-3-4.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-4.1}
2.  [If the client is behind a Network Address Translator (NAT), the
    client\'s private IP addresses, often \[[RFC1918](#RFC1918){.xref}\]
    addresses, can be
    learned.[¶](#section-3-4.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-4.2}
3.  [If the client is behind a proxy (a client-configured \"classical
    application proxy\", as defined in \[[RFC1919](#RFC1919){.xref}\],
    [Section
    3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1919#section-3){.relref}), but
    direct access to the Internet is permitted, WebRTC\'s STUN checks
    will bypass the proxy and reveal the public IP address of the
    client. This concern also applies to the \"enterprise TURN server\"
    scenario described in \[[RFC7478](#RFC7478){.xref}\], [Section
    2.3.5.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7478#section-2.3.5.1){.relref}
    if, as above, direct Internet access is permitted. However, when the
    term \"proxy\" is used in this document, it is always in reference
    to an \[[RFC1919](#RFC1919){.xref}\] proxy
    server.[¶](#section-3-4.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-4.3}

Of these three concerns, the first is the most significant, because for
some users, the purpose of using a VPN is for anonymity. However,
different VPN users will have different needs, and some VPN users (e.g.,
corporate VPN users) may in fact prefer WebRTC to send media traffic
directly \-- i.e., not through the VPN.[¶](#section-3-5){.pilcrow}

The second concern is less significant but valid nonetheless. The core
issue is that web applications can learn about addresses that are not
exposed to the Internet; typically, these address are IPv4, but they can
also be IPv6, as in the case of NAT64 \[[RFC6146](#RFC6146){.xref}\].
While disclosure of the \[[RFC4941](#RFC4941){.xref}\] IPv6 addresses
recommended by \[[RFC8835](#RFC8835){.xref}\] is fairly benign due to
their intentionally short lifetimes, IPv4 addresses present some
challenges. Although private IPv4 addresses often contain minimal
entropy (e.g., 192.168.0.2, a fairly common address), in the worst case,
they can contain 24 bits of entropy with an indefinite lifetime. As
such, they can be a fairly significant fingerprinting surface. In
addition, intranet web sites can be attacked more easily when their IPv4
address range is externally known.[¶](#section-3-6){.pilcrow}

Private IP addresses can also act as an identifier that allows web
applications running in isolated browsing contexts (e.g., normal and
private browsing) to learn that they are running on the same device.
This could allow the application sessions to be correlated, defeating
some of the privacy protections provided by isolation. It should be
noted that private addresses are just one potential mechanism for this
correlation and this is an area for further
study.[¶](#section-3-7){.pilcrow}

The third concern is the least common, as proxy administrators can
already control this behavior through organizational firewall policy,
and generally, forcing WebRTC traffic through a proxy server will have
negative effects on both the proxy and media
quality.[¶](#section-3-8){.pilcrow}

Note also that these concerns predate WebRTC; Adobe Flash Player has
provided similar functionality since the introduction of Real-Time Media
Flow Protocol (RTMFP) support \[[RFC7016](#RFC7016){.xref}\] in
2008.[¶](#section-3-9){.pilcrow}

## [4.](#section-4){.section-number .selfRef} [Goals](#name-goals){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-goals}

WebRTC\'s support of secure peer-to-peer connections facilitates
deployment of decentralized systems, which can have privacy benefits. As
a result, blunt solutions that disable WebRTC or make it significantly
harder to use are undesirable. This document takes a more nuanced
approach, with the following goals:[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

-   [Provide a framework for understanding the problem so that controls
    might be provided to make different trade-offs regarding performance
    and privacy concerns with
    WebRTC.[¶](#section-4-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-4-2.1}
-   [Using that framework, define settings that enable peer-to-peer
    communications, each with a different balance between performance
    and privacy.[¶](#section-4-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-4-2.2}
-   [Finally, provide recommendations for default settings that provide
    reasonable performance without also exposing addressing information
    in a way that might violate user
    expectations.[¶](#section-4-2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-4-2.3}

### [5.1.](#section-5.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Principles](#name-principles){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-principles}

The key principles for our framework are stated
below:[¶](#section-5.1-1){.pilcrow}

1.  [By default, WebRTC traffic should follow typical IP routing (i.e.,
    WebRTC should use the same interface used for HTTP traffic) and only
    the system\'s \'typical\' public addresses (or those of an
    enterprise TURN server, if present) should be visible to the
    application. However, in the interest of optimal media quality, it
    should be possible to enable WebRTC to make use of all network
    interfaces to determine the ideal
    route.[¶](#section-5.1-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.1-2.1}
2.  [By default, WebRTC should be able to negotiate direct peer-to-peer
    connections between endpoints (i.e., without traversing a NAT or
    relay server) when such connections are possible. This ensures that
    applications that need true peer-to-peer routing for bandwidth or
    latency reasons can operate
    successfully.[¶](#section-5.1-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.1-2.2}
3.  [It should be possible to configure WebRTC to not disclose private
    local IP addresses, to avoid the issues associated with web
    applications learning such addresses. This document does not require
    this to be the default state, as there is no currently defined
    mechanism that can satisfy this requirement as well as the
    aforementioned requirement to allow direct peer-to-peer
    connections.[¶](#section-5.1-2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.1-2.3}
4.  [By default, WebRTC traffic should not be sent through proxy
    servers, due to the media-quality problems associated with sending
    WebRTC traffic over TCP, which is almost always used when
    communicating with such proxies, as well as proxy performance issues
    that may result from proxying WebRTC\'s long-lived, high-bandwidth
    connections. However, it should be possible to force WebRTC to send
    its traffic through a configured proxy if
    desired.[¶](#section-5.1-2.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.1-2.4}

::: {#section-5.2 .section}
### [5.2.](#section-5.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Modes and Recommendations](#name-modes-and-recommendations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-modes-and-recommendations}

Based on these ideas, we define four specific modes of WebRTC behavior,
reflecting different media quality/privacy
trade-offs:[¶](#section-5.2-1){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

Mode 1 - Enumerate all addresses:
:   WebRTC [MUST]{.bcp14} use all network interfaces to attempt
    communication with STUN servers, TURN servers, or peers. This will
    converge on the best media path and is ideal when media performance
    is the highest priority, but it discloses the most
    information.[¶](#section-5.2-2.2){.pilcrow}
:   

Mode 2 - Default route + associated local addresses:
:   WebRTC [MUST]{.bcp14} follow the kernel routing table rules, which
    will typically cause media packets to take the same route as the
    application\'s HTTP traffic. If an enterprise TURN server is
    present, the preferred route [MUST]{.bcp14} be through this TURN
    server. Once an interface has been chosen, the private IPv4 and IPv6
    addresses associated with this interface [MUST]{.bcp14} be
    discovered and provided to the application as host candidates. This
    ensures that direct connections can still be established in this
    mode.[¶](#section-5.2-2.4){.pilcrow}
:   

Mode 3 - Default route only:
:   This is the same as Mode 2, except that the associated private
    addresses [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be provided; the only IP addresses
    gathered are those discovered via mechanisms like STUN and TURN (on
    the default route). This may cause traffic to hairpin through a NAT,
    fall back to an application TURN server, or fail altogether, with
    resulting quality implications.[¶](#section-5.2-2.6){.pilcrow}
:   

Mode 4 - Force proxy:
:   This is the same as Mode 3, but when the application\'s HTTP traffic
    is sent through a proxy, WebRTC media traffic [MUST]{.bcp14} also be
    proxied. If the proxy does not support UDP (as is the case for all
    HTTP and most SOCKS \[[RFC1928](#RFC1928){.xref}\] proxies), or the
    WebRTC implementation does not support UDP proxying, the use of UDP
    will be disabled, and TCP will be used to send and receive media
    through the proxy. Use of TCP will result in reduced media quality,
    in addition to any performance considerations associated with
    sending all WebRTC media through the proxy
    server.[¶](#section-5.2-2.8){.pilcrow}
:   

Mode 1 [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be used unless user consent has been provided.
The details of this consent are left to the implementation; one
potential mechanism is to tie this consent to getUserMedia (device
permissions) consent, described in \[[RFC8827](#RFC8827){.xref}\],
[Section
6.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8827#section-6.2){.relref}.
Alternatively, implementations can provide a specific mechanism to
obtain user consent.[¶](#section-5.2-3){.pilcrow}

In cases where user consent has not been obtained, Mode 2
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} be used.[¶](#section-5.2-4){.pilcrow}

These defaults provide a reasonable trade-off that permits trusted
WebRTC applications to achieve optimal network performance but gives
applications without consent (e.g., 1-way streaming or data-channel
applications) only the minimum information needed to achieve direct
connections, as defined in Mode 2. However, implementations
[MAY]{.bcp14} choose stricter modes if desired, e.g., if a user
indicates they want all WebRTC traffic to follow the default
route.[¶](#section-5.2-5){.pilcrow}

Future documents may define additional modes and/or update the
recommended default modes.[¶](#section-5.2-6){.pilcrow}

Note that the suggested defaults can still be used even for
organizations that want all external WebRTC traffic to traverse a proxy
or enterprise TURN server, simply by setting an organizational firewall
policy that allows WebRTC traffic to only leave through the proxy or
TURN server. This provides a way to ensure the proxy or TURN server is
used for any external traffic but still allows direct connections (and,
in the proxy case, avoids the performance issues associated with forcing
media through said proxy) for intra-organization
traffic.[¶](#section-5.2-7){.pilcrow}

### [6.1.](#section-6.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Ensuring Normal Routing](#name-ensuring-normal-routing){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-ensuring-normal-routing}

When trying to follow typical IP routing, as required by Modes 2 and 3,
the simplest approach is to bind() the sockets used for peer-to-peer
connections to the wildcard addresses (0.0.0.0 for IPv4, :: for IPv6),
which allows the OS to route WebRTC traffic the same way as it would
HTTP traffic. STUN and TURN will work as usual, and host candidates can
still be determined as mentioned below.[¶](#section-6.1-1){.pilcrow}

### [6.2.](#section-6.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Determining Associated Local Addresses](#name-determining-associated-loca){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-determining-associated-loca}

When binding to a wildcard address, some extra work is needed to
determine the associated local address required by Mode 2, which we
define as the source address that would be used for any packets sent to
the web application host (assuming that UDP and TCP get the same routing
treatment). Use of the web-application host as a destination ensures the
right source address is selected, regardless of where the application
resides (e.g., on an intranet).[¶](#section-6.2-1){.pilcrow}

First, the appropriate remote IPv4/IPv6 address is obtained by resolving
the host component of the web application URI
\[[RFC3986](#RFC3986){.xref}\]. If the client is behind a proxy and
cannot resolve these IPs via DNS, the address of the proxy can be used
instead. Or, if the web application was loaded from a file:// URI
\[[RFC8089](#RFC8089){.xref}\] rather than over the network, the
implementation can fall back to a well-known DNS name or IP
address.[¶](#section-6.2-2){.pilcrow}

Once a suitable remote IP has been determined, the implementation can
create a UDP socket, bind() it to the appropriate wildcard address, and
then connect() to the remote IP. Generally, this results in the socket
being assigned a local address based on the kernel routing table,
without sending any packets over the
network.[¶](#section-6.2-3){.pilcrow}

Finally, the socket can be queried using getsockname() or the equivalent
to determine the appropriate local address.[¶](#section-6.2-4){.pilcrow}
