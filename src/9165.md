# Additional Control Operators for the Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL) {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

The Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL), standardized in RFC 8610,
provides \"control operators\" as its main language extension
point.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

The present document defines a number of control operators that were not
yet ready at the time RFC 8610 was completed: `.plus`, `.cat`, and
`.det` for the construction of constants; `.abnf`/`.abnfb` for including
ABNF (RFC 5234 and RFC 7405) in CDDL specifications; and `.feature` for
indicating the use of a non-basic feature in an
instance.[¶](#section-abstract-2){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC8174](#RFC8174){.xref}\] when, and only when, they appear in all
capitals, as shown here.[¶](#section-1.1-1){.pilcrow}

This specification uses terminology from \[[RFC8610](#RFC8610){.xref}\].
In particular, with respect to control operators, \"target\" refers to
the left-hand side operand and \"controller\" to the right-hand side
operand. \"Tool\" refers to tools along the lines of that described in
[Appendix F](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8610#appendix-F){.relref}
of \[[RFC8610](#RFC8610){.xref}\]. Note also that the data model
underlying CDDL provides for text strings as well as byte strings as two
separate types, which are then collectively referred to as
\"strings\".[¶](#section-1.1-2){.pilcrow}

The term \"ABNF\" in this specification stands for the combination of
\[[RFC5234](#RFC5234){.xref}\] and \[[RFC7405](#RFC7405){.xref}\]; i.e.,
the ABNF control operators defined by this document allow use of the
case-sensitive extensions defined in
\[[RFC7405](#RFC7405){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1.1-3){.pilcrow}

CDDL as defined in \[[RFC8610](#RFC8610){.xref}\] does not have any
mechanisms to compute literals. To cover a large part of the use cases,
this specification adds three control operators: `.plus` for numeric
addition, `.cat` for string concatenation, and `.det` for string
concatenation with dedenting of both sides (target and
controller).[¶](#section-2-1){.pilcrow}

For these operators, as with all control operators, targets and
controllers are types. The resulting type is therefore formally a
function of the elements of the cross-product of the two types. Not all
tools may be able to work with non-unique targets or
controllers.[¶](#section-2-2){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-2.1 .section}
### [2.1.](#section-2.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Numeric Addition](#name-numeric-addition){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-numeric-addition}

In many cases, numbers are needed relative to a base number in a
specification. The `.plus` control identifies a number that is
constructed by adding the numeric values of the target and the
controller.[¶](#section-2.1-1){.pilcrow}

The target and controller both [MUST]{.bcp14} be numeric. If the target
is a floating point number and the controller an integer number, or vice
versa, the sum is converted into the type of the target; converting from
a floating point number to an integer selects its floor (the largest
integer less than or equal to the floating point number, i.e., rounding
towards negative infinity).[¶](#section-2.1-2){.pilcrow}

:::

The example in [Figure 1](#exa-plus){.xref} contains the generic
definition of a CDDL group `interval` that gives a lower and upper bound
and, optionally, a tolerance. The parameter BASE allows the
non-conflicting use of a multiple of these interval groups in one map by
assigning different labels to the entries of the interval. The rule
`rect` combines two of these interval groups into a map, one group for
the X dimension (using 0, 1, and 2 as labels) and one for the Y
dimension (using 3, 4, and 5 as labels).[¶](#section-2.1-4){.pilcrow}

It is often useful to be able to compose string literals out of
component literals defined in different places in the
specification.[¶](#section-2.2-1){.pilcrow}

The `.cat` control identifies a string that is built from a
concatenation of the target and the controller. The target and
controller both [MUST]{.bcp14} be strings. The result of the operation
has the same type as the target. The concatenation is performed on the
bytes in both strings. If the target is a text string, the result of
that concatenation [MUST]{.bcp14} be valid
UTF-8.[¶](#section-2.2-2){.pilcrow}

:::

The example in [Figure 2](#exa-cat){.xref} builds a text string named
`c` from concatenating the target text string `"foo"` and the controller
byte string entered in a text form byte string literal. (This particular
idiom is useful when the text string contains newlines, which, as shown
in the example for `b`, may be harder to read when entered in the format
that the pure CDDL text string notation inherits from
JSON.)[¶](#section-2.2-4){.pilcrow}

Multi-line string literals for various applications, including embedded
ABNF ([Section 3](#embedded-abnf){.xref}), need to be set flush left, at
least partially. Often, having some indentation in the source code for
the literal can promote readability, as in [Figure
3](#exa-det){.xref}.[¶](#section-2.3-1){.pilcrow}

The control operator `.det` works like `.cat`, except that both
arguments (target and controller) are independently *dedented* before
the concatenation takes place.[¶](#section-2.3-3){.pilcrow}

equivalent to [Figure

For the purposes of this specification, we define \"dedenting\"
as:[¶](#section-2.3-6){.pilcrow}

1.  [determining the smallest amount of leftmost blank space (number of
    leading space characters) present in all the non-blank lines,
    and[¶](#section-2.3-7.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.3-7.1}
2.  [removing exactly that number of leading space characters from each
    line. For blank (blank space only or empty) lines, there may be
    fewer (or no) leading space characters than this amount, in which
    case all leading space is
    removed.[¶](#section-2.3-7.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.3-7.2}

(The name `.det` is a shortcut for \"dedenting cat\". The maybe more
obvious name `.dedcat` has not been chosen as it is longer and may
invoke unpleasant images.)[¶](#section-2.3-8){.pilcrow}

Occasionally, dedenting of only a single item is needed. This can be
achieved by using this operator with an empty string, e.g.,
`"" .det rhs` or `lhs .det ""`, which can in turn be combined with a
`.cat`: in the construct `lhs .cat ("" .det rhs)`, only `rhs` is
dedented.[¶](#section-2.3-9){.pilcrow}

## [3.](#section-3){.section-number .selfRef} [Embedded ABNF](#name-embedded-abnf){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-embedded-abnf}

Many IETF protocols define allowable values for their text strings in
ABNF \[[RFC5234](#RFC5234){.xref}\] \[[RFC7405](#RFC7405){.xref}\]. It
is often desirable to define a text string type in CDDL by employing
existing ABNF embedded into the CDDL specification. Without specific
ABNF support in CDDL, that ABNF would usually need to be translated into
a regular expression (if that is even
possible).[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

ABNF is added to CDDL in the same way that regular expressions were
added: by defining a `.abnf` control operator. The target is usually
`text` or some restriction on it, and the controller is the text of an
ABNF specification.[¶](#section-3-2){.pilcrow}

There are several small issues; the solutions are given
here:[¶](#section-3-3){.pilcrow}

-   [ABNF can be used to define byte sequences as well as UTF-8 text
    strings interpreted as Unicode scalar sequences. This means this
    specification defines two control operators: `.abnfb` for ABNF
    denoting byte sequences and `.abnf` for denoting sequences of
    Unicode scalar values (code points) represented as UTF-8 text
    strings. Both control operators can be applied to targets of either
    string type; the ABNF is applied to the sequence of bytes in the
    string and interprets it as a sequence of bytes (`.abnfb`) or as a
    sequence of code points represented as an UTF-8 text string
    (`.abnf`). The controller string [MUST]{.bcp14} be a string. When a
    byte string, it [MUST]{.bcp14} be valid UTF-8 and is interpreted as
    the text string that has the same sequence of
    bytes.[¶](#section-3-4.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-4.1}
-   [ABNF defines a list of rules, not a single expression (called
    \"elements\" in \[[RFC5234](#RFC5234){.xref}\]). This is resolved by
    requiring the controller string to be one valid \"element\",
    followed by zero or more valid \"rules\" separated from the element
    by a newline; thus, the controller string can be built by preceding
    a piece of valid ABNF by an \"element\" that selects from that ABNF
    and a newline.[¶](#section-3-4.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-4.2}
-   [For the same reason, ABNF requires newlines; specifying newlines in
    CDDL text strings is tedious (and leads to essentially unreadable
    ABNF). The workaround employs the `.cat` operator introduced in
    [Section 2.2](#string-concatenation){.xref} and the syntax for text
    in byte strings. As is customary for ABNF, the syntax of ABNF itself
    (*not* the syntax expressed in ABNF!) is relaxed to allow a single
    line feed as a
    newline:[¶](#section-3-4.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-4.3}

::: {#section-3-5}
``` {.lang-abnf .sourcecode}
   CRLF = %x0A / %x0D.0A
```

[¶](#section-3-5){.pilcrow}
:::

-   [One set of rules provided in an ABNF specification is often used in
    multiple positions, particularly staples such as DIGIT and ALPHA.
    (Note that all rules referenced need to be defined in each ABNF
    operator controller string \-- there is no implicit import of core
    ABNF rules from \[[RFC5234](#RFC5234){.xref}\] or other rules.) The
    composition this calls for can be provided by the `.cat` operator
    and/or by `.det` if there is indentation to be disposed
    of.[¶](#section-3-6.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-6.1}

These points are combined into an example in [Figure
5](#exa-abnf){.xref}, which uses ABNF from
\[[RFC3339](#RFC3339){.xref}\] to specify one of each of the Concise
Binary Object Representation (CBOR) tags defined in
\[[RFC8943](#RFC8943){.xref}\] and

Commonly, the kind of validation enabled by languages such as CDDL
provides a Boolean result: valid or invalid.[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

In rapidly evolving environments, this is too simplistic. The data
models described by a CDDL specification may continually be enhanced by
additional features, and it would be useful even for a specification
that does not yet describe a specific future feature to identify the
extension point the feature can use and accept such extensions while
marking them as extensions.[¶](#section-4-2){.pilcrow}

The `.feature` control annotates the target as making use of the feature
named by the controller. The latter will usually be a string. A tool
that validates an instance against that specification may mark the
instance as using a feature that is annotated by the
specification.[¶](#section-4-3){.pilcrow}

More specifically, the tool\'s diagnostic output might contain the
controller (right-hand side) as a feature name and the target (left-hand
side) as a feature detail. However, in some cases, the target has too
much detail, and the specification might want to hint to the tool that
more limited detail is appropriate. In this case, the controller should
be an array, with the first element being the feature name (that would
otherwise be the entire controller) and the second element being the
detail (usually another string), as illustrated in [Figure
6](#exa-feat-array){.xref}.[¶](#section-4-4){.pilcrow}

[Figure 6](#figure-6){.selfRef}: [Providing Explicit Detail with
.feature](#name-providing-explicit-detail-w){.selfRef}
:::

[Figure 7](#exa-feat-map){.xref} shows what could be the definition of a
person, with potential extensions beyond `name` and `organization` being
marked `further-person-extension`. Extensions that are known at the time
this definition is written can be collected into `$$person-extensions`.
However, future extensions would be deemed invalid unless the wildcard
at the end of the map is added. These extensions could then be
specifically examined by a user or a tool that makes use of the
validation result; the label (map key) actually used makes a fine
feature detail for the tool\'s diagnostic
output.[¶](#section-4-6){.pilcrow}

Leaving out the entire extension point would mean that instances that
make use of an extension would be marked as wholesale invalid, making
the entire validation approach much less useful. Leaving the extension
point in but not marking its use as special would render mistakes (such
as using the label \"`organisation`\" instead of \"`organization`\")
invisible.[¶](#section-4-7){.pilcrow}

A CDDL tool may simply report the set of features being used; the
control then only provides information to the process requesting the
validation. One could also imagine a tool that takes arguments, allowing
the tool to accept certain features and reject others (enable/disable).
The latter approach could, for instance, be used for a JSON/CBOR switch,
as illustrated in [Figure 9](#exa-feat-variants){.xref}, using Sensor
Measurement Lists (SenML) \[[RFC8428](#RFC8428){.xref}\] as the example
data model used with both JSON and CBOR.[¶](#section-4-11){.pilcrow}

```

It remains to be seen if the enable/disable approach can lead to new
idioms of using CDDL. The language currently has no way to enforce
mutually exclusive use of features, as would be needed in this
example.[¶](#section-4-13){.pilcrow}

The security considerations of \[[RFC8610](#RFC8610){.xref}\]
apply.[¶](#section-6-1){.pilcrow}

While both \[[RFC5234](#RFC5234){.xref}\] and
\[[RFC7405](#RFC7405){.xref}\] state that security is truly believed to
be irrelevant to the respective document, the use of formal description
techniques cannot only simplify but sometimes also complicate a
specification. This can lead to security problems in implementations and
in the specification itself. As with CDDL itself, ABNF should be
judiciously applied, and overly complex (or \"cute\") constructions
should be avoided.[¶](#section-6-2){.pilcrow}

the need for `.det`.[¶](#appendix-A-1){.pilcrow}

.det is an abbreviation for \"dedenting cat\", but Det is also the name
