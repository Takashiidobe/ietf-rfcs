# RFC 9264 {#rfcnum}

# Linkset: Media Types and a Link Relation Type for Link Sets {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

This specification defines two formats and associated media types for
representing sets of links as standalone documents. One format is based
on JSON, and the other is aligned with the format for representing links
in the HTTP \"Link\" header field. This specification also introduces a
link relation type to support the discovery of sets of
links.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

Resources on the Web often use typed Web Links
\[[RFC8288](#RFC8288){.xref}\], either (1) embedded in resource
representations \-- for example, using the \<link> element for HTML
documents or (2) conveyed in the HTTP \"Link\" header field for
documents of any media type. In some cases, however, providing links in
this manner is impractical or impossible, and delivering a set of links
as a standalone document is preferable.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

Therefore, this specification defines two formats for representing sets
of Web Links and their attributes as standalone documents. One
serializes links in the same format as the format used in the HTTP
\"Link\" header field, and the other serializes links in JSON. It also
defines associated media types to represent sets of links, and the
\"linkset\" relation type to support the discovery of any resource that
conveys a set of links as a standalone
document.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

In the examples provided in this document, links in the HTTP \"Link\"

readability. Note, however, that as per [Section
5.5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-5.5){.relref} of

The following sections describe use cases in which providing links by
means of a standalone document instead of in an HTTP \"Link\" header
field or as links embedded in the resource representation is
advantageous or necessary.[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

For all scenarios, links could be provided by means of a standalone
document that is formatted according to the JSON-based serialization,
the serialization aligned with the HTTP \"Link\" field format, or both.
The former serialization is motivated by the widespread use of JSON and
related tools, which suggests that handling sets of links expressed as
JSON documents should be attractive to developers. The latter
serialization is provided for compatibility with the existing
serialization used in the HTTP \"Link\" field and to allow the reuse of
tools created to handle it.[¶](#section-3-2){.pilcrow}

It is important to keep in mind that when providing links by means of a
standalone representation, other links can still be provided using other
approaches, i.e., it is possible to combine various mechanisms to convey
links.[¶](#section-3-3){.pilcrow}

### [3.1.](#section-3.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Third-Party Links](#name-third-party-links){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-third-party-links}

In some cases, it is useful that links pertaining to a resource are
provided by a server other than the one that hosts the resource. For
example, this allows:[¶](#section-3.1-1){.pilcrow}

-   [Providing links in which the resource is involved not just as a
    link context but also as a link target, with a different resource
    being the link
    context.[¶](#section-3.1-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.1-2.1}
-   [Providing links pertaining to the resource that the server hosting
    that resource is not aware
    of.[¶](#section-3.1-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.1-2.2}
-   [External management of links pertaining to the resource in a
    special-purpose link management
    service.[¶](#section-3.1-2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.1-2.3}

In such cases, links pertaining to a resource can be provided by
another, specific resource. That specific resource may be managed, by
the same custodian or by another custodian, as the resource to which the
links pertain. For clients intent on consuming links provided in that
manner, it would be beneficial if the following conditions were
met:[¶](#section-3.1-3){.pilcrow}

-   [Links are provided in a document that uses a well-defined media
    type.[¶](#section-3.1-4.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.1-4.1}
-   [The resource to which the provided links pertain is able to link to
    the resource that provides these links using a well-known link
    relation type.[¶](#section-3.1-4.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.1-4.2}

These requirements are addressed in this specification through the
definition of two media types and a link relation type,
respectively.[¶](#section-3.1-5){.pilcrow}

In some cases, it is not straightforward to write links to the HTTP
\"Link\" header field from an application. This can, for example, be the
case because not all required link information is available to the
application or because the application does not have the capability to
directly write HTTP fields. In such cases, providing links by means of a
standalone document can be a solution. Making the resource that provides
these links discoverable can be achieved by means of a typed
link.[¶](#section-3.2-1){.pilcrow}

### [3.3.](#section-3.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Large Number of Links](#name-large-number-of-links){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-large-number-of-links}

When conveying links in an HTTP \"Link\" header field, it is possible
for the size of the HTTP response fields to become unpredictable. This
can be the case when links are determined dynamically in a manner
dependent on a range of contextual factors. It is possible to statically
configure a web server to correctly handle large HTTP response fields by
specifying an upper bound for their size. But when the number of links
is unpredictable, estimating a reliable upper bound is
challenging.[¶](#section-3.3-1){.pilcrow}

[Section 15](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-15){.relref}
of \"HTTP Semantics\" \[[RFC9110](#RFC9110){.xref}\] defines error codes
related to excess communication by the user agent (\"413 Content Too
Large\" and \"414 URI Too Long\"), but no specific error codes are
defined to indicate that response field content exceeds the upper bound
that can be handled by the server and thus has been truncated. As a
result, applications take countermeasures aimed at controlling the size
of the HTTP \"Link\" header field \-- for example, by limiting the links
they provide to those with select relation types, thereby limiting the
value of the HTTP \"Link\" header field to clients. Providing links by
means of a standalone document overcomes challenges related to the
unpredictable (to the web server implementation) nature of the size of
HTTP \"Link\" header fields.[¶](#section-3.3-2){.pilcrow}

## [4.](#section-4){.section-number .selfRef} [Document Formats for Sets of Links](#name-document-formats-for-sets-o){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-document-formats-for-sets-o}

This section specifies two document formats to convey a set of links.
Both are based on the abstract model specified in [Section
2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8288#section-2){.relref} of \"Web
Linking\" \[[RFC8288](#RFC8288){.xref}\], which defines a link as
consisting of a \"link context\", a \"link relation type\", a \"link
target\", and optional \"target attributes\":[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

-   [The format defined in [Section 4.1](#linkset-native){.xref} is
    nearly identical to the field value of the HTTP \"Link\" header
    field as specified in [Section
    3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8288#section-3){.relref} of
    \[[RFC8288](#RFC8288){.xref}\].[¶](#section-4-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-4-2.1}
-   [The format defined in [Section 4.2](#linkset-json){.xref} is
    expressed in [JSON](#RFC8259){.xref}
    \[[RFC8259](#RFC8259){.xref}\].[¶](#section-4-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-4-2.2}

Links provided in the HTTP \"Link\" header field are intended to be used
in the context of an HTTP interaction, and contextual information that
is available during an interaction is used to correctly interpret them.
Links provided in link sets, however, can be reused outside of an HTTP
interaction, when no such contextual information is available. As a
result, implementers of link sets should strive to make them
self-contained by adhering to the following
recommendations.[¶](#section-4-3){.pilcrow}

For links provided in the HTTP \"Link\" header field that have no anchor
or that use relative references, the URI of the resource that delivers
the links provides the contextual information that is needed for their
correct interpretation. In order to support use cases where link set
documents are reused outside the context of an HTTP interaction, it is
[RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14} to make them self-contained by adhering to the
following guidelines:[¶](#section-4-4){.pilcrow}

-   [For every link provided in the set of links, explicitly provide the
    link context using the \"anchor\"
    attribute.[¶](#section-4-5.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-4-5.1}
-   [For the link context (\"anchor\" attribute) and link target
    (\"href\" attribute), use URI references that are not relative
    references (as defined in [Section
    4.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986#section-4.1){.relref} of
    \[[RFC3986](#RFC3986){.xref}\]).[¶](#section-4-5.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-4-5.2}

If these recommendations are not followed, the interpretation of links
in link set documents will depend on which URI is used as the
context.[¶](#section-4-6){.pilcrow}

For a \"title\" attribute provided on a link in the HTTP \"Link\" header
field, the language in which the title is expressed is provided by the
\"Content-Language\" header field of the HTTP interaction with the
resource that delivers the links. This does not apply to \"title\"
attributes provided for links in link set documents because that would
constrain all links in a link set to having a single title language and
would not support determining title languages when a link set is used
outside of an HTTP interaction. In order to support use cases where link
set documents are reused outside the context of an HTTP interaction, it
is [RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14} to make them self-contained by using the
\"title\*\" attribute instead of the \"title\" attribute because
\"title\*\" allows expressing the title language as part of its value by
means of a language tag. Note that, in this regard, language tags are
matched case insensitively (see [Section
2.1.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5646#section-2.1.1){.relref} of
\[[RFC5646](#RFC5646){.xref}\]). If this recommendation is not followed,
accurately determining the language of titles provided on links in link
set documents will not be possible.[¶](#section-4-7){.pilcrow}

Note also that [Section
3.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8288#section-3.3){.relref} of
\[[RFC8288](#RFC8288){.xref}\] deprecates the \"rev\" construct that was
provided by \[[RFC5988](#RFC5988){.xref}\] as a means to express links
with a directionality that is the inverse of direct links that use the
\"rel\" construct. In both serializations for link sets defined here,
inverse links may be represented as direct links using the \"rel\"
construct and by switching the roles of the resources involved in the
link.[¶](#section-4-8){.pilcrow}

This document format is nearly identical to the field value of the HTTP
\"Link\" header field as defined in [Section
3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8288#section-3){.relref} of
\[[RFC8288](#RFC8288){.xref}\], more specifically by its ABNF
\[[RFC5234](#RFC5234){.xref}\] production rule for \"Link\" and its
subsequent rules. It differs from the format for field values of the
HTTP \"Link\" header field only in that not only spaces and horizontal
tabs are allowed as separators but also newline characters as a means to
improve readability for humans. The use of non-ASCII characters in the
field value of the HTTP \"Link\" header field is not allowed and as such
is also not allowed in \"application/linkset\" link
sets.[¶](#section-4.1-1){.pilcrow}

The assigned media type for this format is
\"application/linkset\".[¶](#section-4.1-2){.pilcrow}

When converting an \"application/linkset\" document to a field value for
the HTTP \"Link\" header field, newline characters [MUST]{.bcp14} be
removed or [MUST]{.bcp14} be replaced by whitespace (SP) in order to
comply with [Section
5.5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-5.5){.relref} of
\[[RFC9110](#RFC9110){.xref}\].[¶](#section-4.1-3){.pilcrow}

Implementers of \"application/linkset\" link sets should strive to make
them self-contained by following the recommendations provided in
[Section 4](#linkset-formats){.xref} regarding their use outside the
context of an HTTP interaction.[¶](#section-4.1-4){.pilcrow}

It should be noted that the \"application/linkset\" format specified
here is different from the \"application/link-format\" format specified
in \[[RFC6690](#RFC6690){.xref}\] in that the former fully matches the
field value of the HTTP \"Link\" header field as defined in [Section

This document format uses JSON \[[RFC8259](#RFC8259){.xref}\] as the
syntax to represent a set of links. The set of links follows the

\"application/linkset+json\".[¶](#section-4.2-2){.pilcrow}

In the interests of interoperability, \"application/linkset+json\" link
sets [MUST]{.bcp14} be encoded using UTF-8 as per [Section
8.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8259#section-8.1){.relref} of

The \"application/linkset+json\" serialization allows for
[OPTIONAL]{.bcp14} support of a JSON-LD serialization. This can be
achieved by adding an appropriate context to the
\"application/linkset+json\" serialization using the approach described
in [Section

of \[[W3C.REC-json-ld](#W3C.REC-json-ld){.xref}\]. Communities of
practice can decide which context best meets their application needs.
[Appendix A](#appendix-1){.xref} shows an example of a possible context
that, when added to a JSON serialization, allows it to be interpreted as

#### [4.2.5.](#section-4.2.5){.section-number .selfRef} [JSON Extensibility](#name-json-extensibility){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-json-extensibility}

The Web Linking model \[[RFC8288](#RFC8288){.xref}\] provides for the
use of extension target attributes as discussed in [Section
4.2.4.3](#json-target-attributes-extension){.xref}. The use of other
forms of extensions is [NOT RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14}. Limiting the JSON
format in this way allows unambiguous round trips between links provided
in the HTTP \"Link\" header field, sets of links serialized according to
the \"application/linkset\" format, and sets of links serialized
according to the \"application/linkset+json\"
format.[¶](#section-4.2.5-1){.pilcrow}

Cases may exist in which the use of extensions other than those
discussed in [Section 4.2.4.3](#json-target-attributes-extension){.xref}
may be useful \-- for example, when a link set publisher needs to
include descriptive or technical metadata for internal consumption. If
such extensions are used, they [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} change the semantics
of the JSON members defined in this specification. Agents that consume
JSON linkset documents can safely ignore such
extensions.[¶](#section-4.2.5-2){.pilcrow}

As a means to convey specific constraints or conventions (as per
\[[RFC6906](#RFC6906){.xref}\]) that apply to a link set document, the
\"profile\" parameter [MAY]{.bcp14} be used in conjunction with the
media types \"application/linkset\" and \"application/linkset+json\" as
detailed in Sections [4.1](#linkset-native){.xref} and
[4.2](#linkset-json){.xref}, respectively. For example, the parameter
could be used to indicate that a link set uses a specific, limited set
of link relation types.[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

The value of the \"profile\" parameter [MUST]{.bcp14} be a non-empty
list of space-separated URIs, each of which identifies specific
constraints or conventions that apply to the link set document. When
providing multiple profile URIs, care should be taken that the
corresponding profiles are not conflicting. Profile URIs [MAY]{.bcp14}
be registered in the IANA\'s \"Profile URIs\" registry in the manner
specified by \[[RFC7284](#RFC7284){.xref}\].[¶](#section-5-2){.pilcrow}

The presence of a \"profile\" parameter in conjunction with the
\"application/linkset\" and \"application/linkset+json\" media types
does not change the semantics of a link set. As such, clients with and
without knowledge of profile URIs can use the same
representation.[¶](#section-5-3){.pilcrow}

[Section 7.4.2](#profile-parameter-example){.xref} shows an example of
using the \"profile\" parameter in conjunction with the
\"application/linkset+json\" media type.[¶](#section-5-4){.pilcrow}

The target of a link with the \"linkset\" relation type provides a set
of links, including links in which the resource that is the link context
participates.[¶](#section-6-1){.pilcrow}

A link with the \"linkset\" relation type [MAY]{.bcp14} be provided in
the header field and/or the body of a resource\'s representation. It may
also be discovered by other means, such as through client-side
information.[¶](#section-6-2){.pilcrow}

A resource [MAY]{.bcp14} provide more than one link with a \"linkset\"
relation type. Multiple such links can refer to the same set of links
expressed using different media types, or to different sets of links,
potentially provided by different third-party
services.[¶](#section-6-3){.pilcrow}

The set of links provided by the resource that is the target of a
\"linkset\" link may contain links in which the resource that is the
context of the \"linkset\" link does not participate. User agents
[MUST]{.bcp14} process each link in the link set independently,
including processing of the link context and link target, and
[MAY]{.bcp14} ignore links from the link set in which the context of the
\"linkset\" link does not participate.[¶](#section-6-4){.pilcrow}

A user agent that follows a \"linkset\" link and obtains links for which
anchors and targets are expressed as relative references (as per
[Section
4.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986#section-4.1){.relref} of
\[[RFC3986](#RFC3986){.xref}\]) [MUST]{.bcp14} determine what the
context is for these links; it [SHOULD]{.bcp14} ignore links for which
it is unable to unambiguously make that
determination.[¶](#section-6-5){.pilcrow}

As a means to convey specific constraints or conventions (as per
\[[RFC6906](#RFC6906){.xref}\]) that apply to a link set document, the
\"profile\" attribute [MAY]{.bcp14} be used in conjunction with the
\"linkset\" link relation type. For example, the attribute could be used
to indicate that a link set uses a specific, limited set of link
relation types. The value of the \"profile\" attribute [MUST]{.bcp14} be
a non-empty list of space-separated URIs, each of which identifies
specific constraints or conventions that apply to the link set document.
Profile URIs [MAY]{.bcp14} be registered in the IANA\'s \"Profile URIs\"
registry in the manner specified by \[[RFC7284](#RFC7284){.xref}\].
[Section 7.4.1](#profile-attribute-example){.xref} shows an example of
using the \"profile\" attribute on a link with the \"linkset\" relation

## [9.](#section-9){.section-number .selfRef} [Security Considerations](#name-security-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-security-considerations}

The security considerations of [Section
7](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986#section-7){.relref} of
\[[RFC3986](#RFC3986){.xref}\] apply, as well as those of Web Linking
\[[RFC8288](#RFC8288){.xref}\] as long as the latter are not
specifically discussing the risks of exposing information in HTTP header
fields.[¶](#section-9-1){.pilcrow}

In general, links may cause information leakage when they expose
information (such as URIs) that can be sensitive or private. Links may
expose \"hidden URIs\" that are not supposed to be openly shared and
that may not be sufficiently protected. Ideally, none of the URIs
exposed in links should be supposed to be \"hidden\"; instead, if these
URIs are supposed to be limited to certain users, then technical
measures should be put in place so that accidentally exposing them does
not cause any harm.[¶](#section-9-2){.pilcrow}

For the specific mechanisms defined in this specification, two security
considerations should be taken into account:[¶](#section-9-3){.pilcrow}

-   [The Web Linking model always has an \"implicit context\", which is
    the resource of the HTTP interaction. This original context can be
    lost or can change when self-contained link representations are
    moved. Changing the context can change the interpretation of links
    when they have no explicit anchor or when they use relative URIs.
    Applications may choose to ignore links that have no explicit anchor
    or that use relative URIs when these are exchanged in standalone
    resources.[¶](#section-9-4.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-9-4.1}
-   [The model introduced in this specification supports \"third-party
    links\", where one party can provide links that have another
    party\'s resource as an anchor. Depending on the link semantics and
    the application context, it is important to verify that there is
    sufficient trust in that third party to allow it to provide these
    links. Applications may choose to treat third-party links
    differently than cases where a resource and the links for that
    resource are provided by the same
    party.[¶](#section-9-4.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-9-4.2}

## [Appendix A.](#appendix-A){.section-number .selfRef} [JSON-LD Context](#name-json-ld-context){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-json-ld-context}

A set of links rendered according to the JSON serialization defined in
[Section 4.2](#linkset-json){.xref} can be interpreted as RDF triples by
adding a [JSON-LD context](#W3C.REC-json-ld){.xref}
\[[W3C.REC-json-ld](#W3C.REC-json-ld){.xref}\] that maps the JSON keys
to corresponding Linked Data terms. And, as per [Section
6.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/#interpreting-json-as-json-ld){.relref}
of \[[W3C.REC-json-ld](#W3C.REC-json-ld){.xref}\], when delivering a
link set that is rendered according to the \"application/linkset+json\"
media type to a user agent, a server can convey the availability of such
a JSON-LD context by using a link with the relation type
\"[http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context](https://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context)\"
in the HTTP \"Link\" header field.[¶](#appendix-A-1){.pilcrow}

[Figure 19](#contextlinkrel){.xref} shows the response to an HTTP GET
against the URI of a link set resource and illustrates this approach to
support the discovery of a JSON-LD context. This example is inspired by
the GS1 implementation and shows a link set that uses relation types
from the GS1 vocabulary at \<<https://www.gs1.org/voc/>\> that are
expressed as HTTP URIs.[¶](#appendix-A-2){.pilcrow}

In order to obtain the JSON-LD context conveyed by the server, the user
agent issues an HTTP GET against the link target of the link with the
\"[http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context](https://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context)\"
relation type. The response to this GET is shown in [Figure

\"application/linkset+json\" representations of link sets to Dublin Core
terms \[[DCMI-TERMS](#DCMI-TERMS){.xref}\]. Note that the \"linkset\"
entry in the JSON-LD context is introduced to support links with the
\"linkset\" relation type in link sets.[¶](#appendix-A-4){.pilcrow}

[Figure 20](#figure-20){.selfRef}: [JSON-LD context mapping to Dublin
Core terms](#name-json-ld-context-mapping-to-){.selfRef}
:::

Applying the JSON-LD context of [Figure 20](#jsonld-context){.xref} to
the link set of [Figure 19](#contextlinkrel){.xref} allows transforming
the \"application/linkset+json\" link set to an RDF link set. [Figure
21](#triples){.xref} shows the latter represented by means of the
\"text/turtle\" RDF serialization.[¶](#appendix-A-6){.pilcrow}
