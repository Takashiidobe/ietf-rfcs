# RFC 9012 {#rfcnum}

# The BGP Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

This document defines a BGP path attribute known as the \"Tunnel
Encapsulation attribute\", which can be used with BGP UPDATEs of various
Subsequent Address Family Identifiers (SAFIs) to provide information
needed to create tunnels and their corresponding encapsulation headers.
It provides encodings for a number of tunnel types, along with
procedures for choosing between alternate tunnels and routing packets
into tunnels.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

This document obsoletes RFC 5512, which provided an earlier definition
of the Tunnel Encapsulation attribute. RFC 5512 was never deployed in
production. Since RFC 5566 relies on RFC 5512, it is likewise obsoleted.
This document updates RFC 5640 by indicating that the Load-Balancing
Block sub-TLV may be included in any Tunnel Encapsulation attribute
where load balancing is desired.[¶](#section-abstract-2){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC5512](#RFC5512){.xref}\] defines a BGP path attribute known as the
Tunnel Encapsulation attribute. This attribute consists of one or more
TLVs. Each TLV identifies a particular type of tunnel. Each TLV also
contains one or more sub-TLVs. Some of the sub-TLVs, for example, the
Encapsulation sub-TLV, contain information that may be used to form the
encapsulation header for the specified tunnel type. Other sub-TLVs, for
example, the \"color sub-TLV\" and the \"protocol sub-TLV\", contain
information that aids in determining whether particular packets should
be sent through the tunnel that the TLV
identifies.[¶](#section-1.1-1){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC5512](#RFC5512){.xref}\] only allows the Tunnel Encapsulation
attribute to be attached to BGP UPDATE messages of the Encapsulation
Address Family. These UPDATE messages have an Address Family Identifier
(AFI) of 1 or 2, and a SAFI of 7. In an UPDATE of the Encapsulation
SAFI, the Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) is an address of
the BGP speaker originating the UPDATE. Consider the following
scenario:[¶](#section-1.1-2){.pilcrow}

-   [BGP speaker R1 has received and selected UPDATE U for local
    use;[¶](#section-1.1-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-1.1-3.1}

    SAFI;[¶](#section-1.1-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-1.1-3.2}

    NLRI;[¶](#section-1.1-3.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-1.1-3.3}

Consider the case of a router R1 forwarding an IP packet P. Let D be
P\'s IP destination address. R1 must look up D in its forwarding table.
Suppose that the \"best match\" route for D is route Q, where Q is a
BGP-distributed route whose \"BGP next hop\" is router R2. And suppose
further that the routers along the path from R1 to R2 have entries for
R2 in their forwarding tables but do NOT have entries for D in their
forwarding tables. For example, the path from R1 to R2 may be part of a
\"BGP-free core\", where there are no BGP-distributed routes at all in
the core. Or, as in \[[RFC5565](#RFC5565){.xref}\], D may be an IPv4
address while the intermediate routers along the path from R1 to R2 may
support only IPv6.[¶](#section-1.3-1){.pilcrow}

In cases such as this, in order for R1 to properly forward packet P, it
must encapsulate P and send P \"through a tunnel\" to R2. For example,
R1 may encapsulate P using GRE, Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol version 3
(L2TPv3), IP in IP, etc., where the destination IP address of the
encapsulation header is the address of R2.[¶](#section-1.3-2){.pilcrow}

In order for R1 to encapsulate P for transport to R2, R1 must know what
encapsulation protocol to use for transporting different sorts of
packets to R2. R1 must also know how to fill in the various fields of
the encapsulation header. With certain encapsulation types, this
knowledge may be acquired by default or through manual configuration.
Other encapsulation protocols have fields such as session id, key, or
cookie that must be filled in. It would not be desirable to require
every BGP speaker to be manually configured with the encapsulation
information for every one of its BGP next
hops.[¶](#section-1.3-3){.pilcrow}

This document specifies a way in which BGP itself can be used by a given
BGP speaker to tell other BGP speakers, \"If you need to encapsulate
packets to be sent to me, here\'s the information you need to properly
form the encapsulation header\". A BGP speaker signals this information
to other BGP speakers by using a new BGP attribute type value \-- the
BGP Tunnel Encapsulation attribute. This attribute specifies the
encapsulation protocols that may be used, as well as whatever additional
information (if any) is needed in order to properly use those protocols.
Other attributes, for example, communities or extended communities, may
also be included.[¶](#section-1.3-4){.pilcrow}

    has a two-octet Length
    field.[¶](#section-1.4-2.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-1.4-2.5}

One of the sub-TLVs defined in \[[RFC5512](#RFC5512){.xref}\] is the
\"Encapsulation sub-TLV\". For a given tunnel, the Encapsulation sub-TLV
specifies some of the information needed to construct the encapsulation
header used when sending packets through that tunnel. This document
defines Encapsulation sub-TLVs for a number of tunnel types not
discussed in \[[RFC5512](#RFC5512){.xref}\]: Virtual eXtensible Local
Area Network (VXLAN) \[[RFC7348](#RFC7348){.xref}\], Network
Virtualization Using Generic Routing Encapsulation (NVGRE)
\[[RFC7637](#RFC7637){.xref}\], and MPLS in Generic Routing
Encapsulation (MPLS-in-GRE) \[[RFC4023](#RFC4023){.xref}\]. MPLS-in-UDP
\[[RFC7510](#RFC7510){.xref}\] is also supported, but an Encapsulation
sub-TLV for it is not needed since there are no additional parameters to
be signaled.[¶](#section-1.4-3){.pilcrow}

Some of the encapsulations mentioned in the previous paragraph need to
be further encapsulated inside UDP and/or IP.
\[[RFC5512](#RFC5512){.xref}\] provides no way to specify that certain
information is to appear in these outer IP and/or UDP encapsulations.
This document provides a framework for including such information in the
TLVs of the Tunnel Encapsulation attribute.[¶](#section-1.4-4){.pilcrow}

When the Tunnel Encapsulation attribute is attached to a BGP UPDATE
whose AFI/SAFI identifies one of the labeled address families, it is not
always obvious whether the label embedded in the NLRI is to appear
somewhere in the tunnel encapsulation header (and if so, where), whether
it is to appear in the payload, or whether it can be omitted altogether.
This is especially true if the tunnel encapsulation header itself
contains a \"virtual network identifier\". This document provides a
mechanism that allows one to signal (by using sub-TLVs of the Tunnel
Encapsulation attribute) how one wants to use the embedded label when
the tunnel encapsulation has its own Virtual Network Identifier
field.[¶](#section-1.4-5){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC5512](#RFC5512){.xref}\] defines an Encapsulation Extended
Community that can be used instead of the Tunnel Encapsulation attribute
under certain circumstances. This document describes how the
Encapsulation Extended Community can be used in a backwards-compatible
fashion (see [Section 4.1](#encapsulation-extcomm){.xref}). It is
possible to combine Encapsulation Extended Communities and Tunnel
Encapsulation attributes in the same BGP UPDATE in this
manner.[¶](#section-1.4-6){.pilcrow}

In order to determine the Route Origin ASN of the address depicted in
the Address subfield of the Tunnel Egress Endpoint sub-TLV, it is
necessary to consider the forwarding route \-- that is, the route that
will be used to forward traffic toward that address. This route is
determined by a recursive route-lookup operation for that address, as
discussed in \[[RFC4271](#RFC4271){.xref}\], [Section
5.1.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4271#section-5.1.3){.relref}.
The relevant AS path to consider is the last one encountered while
performing the recursive lookup; the procedures of
\[[RFC6811](#RFC6811){.xref}\], [Section
2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6811#section-2){.relref} are
applied to that AS path to determine the Route Origin ASN. If no AS path
is encountered at all, for example, if that route\'s source is a
protocol other than BGP, the Route Origin ASN is the BGP speaker\'s own
AS number. Call this value Egress_AS.[¶](#section-3.1.1-3){.pilcrow}

If Route_AS does not equal Egress_AS, then the Tunnel Egress Endpoint
sub-TLV is considered not to be valid. In some cases, a network operator
who controls a set of ASes might wish to allow a tunnel egress endpoint
to reside in an AS other than Route_AS; configuration [MAY]{.bcp14}
allow for such a case, in which case the check becomes: if Egress_AS is
not within the configured set of permitted AS numbers, then the Tunnel
Egress Endpoint sub-TLV is considered to be
\"malformed\".[¶](#section-3.1.1-4){.pilcrow}

Note that if the forwarding route changes, this procedure [MUST]{.bcp14}
be reapplied. As a result, a sub-TLV that was formerly considered valid
might become not valid, or vice versa.[¶](#section-3.1.1-5){.pilcrow}

This section defines Encapsulation sub-TLVs for the following tunnel
types: VXLAN \[[RFC7348](#RFC7348){.xref}\], NVGRE
\[[RFC7637](#RFC7637){.xref}\], MPLS-in-GRE
\[[RFC4023](#RFC4023){.xref}\], L2TPv3 \[[RFC3931](#RFC3931){.xref}\],
and GRE \[[RFC2784](#RFC2784){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3.2-1){.pilcrow}

Rules for forming the encapsulation based on the information in a given
TLV are given in Sections [6](#usage){.xref} and
[9](#use-of-vni){.xref}.[¶](#section-3.2-2){.pilcrow}

Recall that the tunnel type itself is identified by the Tunnel Type
field in the attribute header ([Section 2](#encaps-attr){.xref}); the
Encapsulation sub-TLV\'s structure is inferred from this. Regardless of
the tunnel type, the sub-TLV type of the Encapsulation sub-TLV is 1.
There are also tunnel types for which it is not necessary to define an
Encapsulation sub-TLV, because there are no fields in the encapsulation
header whose values need to be signaled from the tunnel egress
endpoint.[¶](#section-3.2-3){.pilcrow}

Some of the tunnel types that can be specified in the Tunnel

there is a standard UDP destination port value for a particular tunnel

than the standard one, the port to be used can be specified by including
a UDP Destination Port sub-TLV. The Value field of this sub-TLV is
always a two-octet field, containing the port value. Any two-octet value

For example, if there are three L2TPv3 sessions, one carrying IPv4
packets, one carrying IPv6 packets, and one carrying MPLS packets, the
egress router will include three TLVs of L2TPv3 encapsulation type, each
specifying a different Session ID and a different payload type. The
Protocol Type sub-TLV for these will be IPv4 (protocol type = 0x0800),
IPv6 (protocol type = 0x86dd), and MPLS (protocol type = 0x8847),
respectively. This informs the ingress routers of the appropriate
encapsulation information to use with each of the given protocol types.
Insertion of the specified Session ID at the ingress routers allows the
egress to process the incoming packets correctly, according to their
protocol type.[¶](#section-3.4.1-3){.pilcrow}

Note that for tunnel types whose names are of the form \"X-in-Y\" (for
example, MPLS-in-GRE), only packets of the specified payload type \"X\"
are to be carried through the tunnel of type \"Y\". This is the
equivalent of specifying a tunnel type \"Y\" and including in its TLV a
Protocol Type sub-TLV (see [Section 3.4.1](#protocol-type){.xref})
specifying protocol \"X\". If the tunnel type is \"X-in-Y\", it is
unnecessary, though harmless, to explicitly include a Protocol Type

Certain BGP address families (corresponding to particular AFI/SAFI
pairs, for example, 1/4, 2/4, 1/128, 2/128) have MPLS labels embedded in
their NLRIs. The term \"embedded label\" is used to refer to the MPLS
label that is embedded in an NLRI, and the term \"labeled address
family\" to refer to any AFI/SAFI that has embedded
labels.[¶](#section-3.5-1){.pilcrow}

Some of the tunnel types (for example, VXLAN and NVGRE) that can be
specified in the Tunnel Encapsulation attribute have an encapsulation
header containing a virtual network identifier of some sort. The
Encapsulation sub-TLVs for these tunnel types may optionally specify a
value for the virtual network identifier.[¶](#section-3.5-2){.pilcrow}

Suppose a Tunnel Encapsulation attribute is attached to an UPDATE of a
labeled address family, and it is decided to use a particular tunnel
(specified in one of the attribute\'s TLVs) for transmitting a packet
that is being forwarded according to that UPDATE. When forming the
encapsulation header for that packet, different deployment scenarios
require different handling of the embedded label and/or the virtual
network identifier. The Embedded Label Handling sub-TLV can be used to
control the placement of the embedded label and/or the virtual network
identifier in the encapsulation.[¶](#section-3.5-3){.pilcrow}

The Embedded Label Handling sub-TLV may be included in any TLV of the
Tunnel Encapsulation attribute. If the Tunnel Encapsulation attribute is
attached to an UPDATE of a non-labeled address family, then the sub-TLV
[MUST]{.bcp14} be disregarded. If the sub-TLV is contained in a TLV
whose tunnel type does not have a virtual network identifier in its
encapsulation header, the sub-TLV [MUST]{.bcp14} be disregarded. In
those cases where the sub-TLV is ignored, it [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be
stripped from the TLV before the route is
propagated.[¶](#section-3.5-4){.pilcrow}

The sub-TLV\'s Length field always contains the value 1, and its Value
field consists of a single octet. The following values are
defined:[¶](#section-3.5-5){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

1:
:   The payload will be an MPLS packet with the embedded label at the
    top of its label stack.[¶](#section-3.5-6.2){.pilcrow}

:   The embedded label is not carried in the payload but is either
    carried in the Virtual Network Identifier field of the encapsulation

If any value other than 1 or 2 is carried, the sub-TLV [MUST]{.bcp14} be

packet before any other labels are pushed onto the packet. (See [Section

In particular, if the Tunnel Encapsulation attribute is attached to a

Stack sub-TLV [MUST]{.bcp14} be pushed onto the packet before the label
embedded in the NLRI is pushed onto the
packet.[¶](#section-3.6-7){.pilcrow}

If the MPLS Label Stack sub-TLV is included in a TLV identifying a

[MUST]{.bcp14} be pushed onto the packet before the procedures of
[Section 9](#use-of-vni){.xref} are
applied.[¶](#section-3.6-8){.pilcrow}

The number of label stack entries in the sub-TLV [MUST]{.bcp14} be
determined from the Sub-TLV Length field. Thus, it is not necessary to
set the S bit in any of the label stack entries of the sub-TLV, and the
setting of the S bit is ignored when parsing the sub-TLV. When the label
stack entries are pushed onto a packet that already has a label stack,
the S bits of all the entries being pushed [MUST]{.bcp14} be cleared.
When the label stack entries are pushed onto a packet that does not
already have a label stack, the S bit of the bottommost label stack
entry [MUST]{.bcp14} be set, and the S bit of all the other label stack
entries [MUST]{.bcp14} be cleared.[¶](#section-3.6-9){.pilcrow}

The Traffic Class (TC) field
\[[RFC3270](#RFC3270){.xref}\]\[[RFC5129](#RFC5129){.xref}\] of each
label stack entry [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be set to 0, unless changed by policy
at the originator of the sub-TLV. When pushing the label stack onto a
packet, the TC of each label stack [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be preserved, unless
local policy results in a modification.[¶](#section-3.6-10){.pilcrow}

The TTL (Time to Live) field of each label stack entry [SHOULD]{.bcp14}
be set to 255, unless changed to some other non-zero value by policy at
the originator of the sub-TLV. When pushing the label stack onto a
packet, the TTL of each label stack entry [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be preserved,
unless local policy results in a modification to some other non-zero
value. If any label stack entry in the sub-TLV has a TTL value of zero,
the router that is pushing the stack onto a packet [MUST]{.bcp14} change
the value to a non-zero value, either 255 or some other value as
determined by policy as discussed above.[¶](#section-3.6-11){.pilcrow}

Note that this sub-TLV can appear within a TLV identifying any type of
tunnel, not just within a TLV identifying an MPLS tunnel. However, if
this sub-TLV appears within a TLV identifying an MPLS tunnel (or an

or an Originator SRGB (Source Routing Global Block)
TLV.[¶](#section-3.7-1){.pilcrow}

This document defines a Prefix-SID (Prefix Segment Identifier) sub-TLV.
The Value field of the Prefix-SID sub-TLV can be set to any permitted
value of the Value field of a BGP Prefix-SID attribute
\[[RFC8669](#RFC8669){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3.7-2){.pilcrow}

Prefix-SID attribute is attached to routes of type IPv4/IPv6 Labeled
Unicast \[[RFC4760](#RFC4760){.xref}\]\[[RFC8277](#RFC8277){.xref}\],
and it only defines values of the BGP Prefix-SID attribute for those
cases. Therefore, similar limitations exist for the Prefix-SID sub-TLV:
it [SHOULD]{.bcp14} only be included in a BGP UPDATE message for one of
the address families for which \[[RFC8669](#RFC8669){.xref}\] has a
defined behavior, namely BGP IPv4/IPv6 Labeled Unicast
\[[RFC4760](#RFC4760){.xref}\] \[[RFC8277](#RFC8277){.xref}\]. If
included in a BGP UPDATE for any other address family, it [MUST]{.bcp14}
be ignored.[¶](#section-3.7-3){.pilcrow}

The Prefix-SID sub-TLV can occur in a TLV identifying any type of
tunnel. If an Originator SRGB is specified in the sub-TLV, that SRGB
[MUST]{.bcp14} be interpreted to be the SRGB used by the tunnel\'s
egress endpoint. The Label-Index, if present, is the Segment Routing SID
that the tunnel\'s egress endpoint uses to represent the prefix
appearing in the NLRI field of the BGP UPDATE to which the Tunnel
Encapsulation attribute is attached.[¶](#section-3.7-4){.pilcrow}

If a Label-Index is present in the Prefix-SID sub-TLV, then when a
packet is sent through the tunnel identified by the TLV, if that tunnel
is from a labeled address family, the corresponding MPLS label
[MUST]{.bcp14} be pushed on the packet\'s label stack. The corresponding
MPLS label is computed from the Label-Index value and the SRGB of the
route\'s originator, as specified in [Section
4.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8669#section-4.1){.relref} of
\[[RFC8669](#RFC8669){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3.7-5){.pilcrow}

The corresponding MPLS label is pushed on after the processing of the
MPLS Label Stack sub-TLV, if present, as specified in [Section
3.6](#label-stack){.xref}. It is pushed on before any other labels (for
example, a label embedded in an UPDATE\'s NLRI or a label determined by
the procedures of [Section 9](#use-of-vni){.xref}) are pushed on the
stack.[¶](#section-3.7-6){.pilcrow}

The Prefix-SID sub-TLV has slightly different semantics than the BGP
Prefix-SID attribute. When the BGP Prefix-SID attribute is attached to a
given route, the BGP speaker that originally attached the attribute is
expected to be in the same Segment Routing domain as the BGP speakers
who receive the route with the attached attribute. The Label-Index tells
the receiving BGP speakers what the Prefix-SID is for the advertised
prefix in that Segment Routing domain. When the Prefix-SID sub-TLV is
used, there is no implication that the Prefix-SID for the advertised
prefix is the same in the Segment Routing domains of the BGP speaker
that originated the sub-TLV and the BGP speaker that received
it.[¶](#section-3.7-7){.pilcrow}

In certain situations with an IP fabric underlay, one could have a

advertise the IP-in-IP tunnel endpoint address in the Tunnel Egress
Endpoint sub-TLV. When the tunnel type of the TLV is IP-in-IP, it will

Unicast), 1/4 (IPv4 Labeled Unicast), 2/4 (IPv6 Labeled Unicast), 1/128

(Ethernet VPN, usually known as EVPN). Use of the Tunnel Encapsulation
attribute in BGP UPDATE messages of other AFI/SAFIs is outside the scope
of this document.[¶](#section-6-1){.pilcrow}

There is no significance to the order in which the TLVs occur within the
Tunnel Encapsulation attribute. Multiple TLVs may occur for a given
tunnel type; each such TLV is regarded as describing a different tunnel.
(This also applies if the Encapsulation Extended Community encoding is
used.)[¶](#section-6-2){.pilcrow}

The decision to attach a Tunnel Encapsulation attribute to a given BGP
UPDATE is determined by policy. The set of TLVs and sub-TLVs contained
in the attribute is also determined by
policy.[¶](#section-6-3){.pilcrow}

Suppose that:[¶](#section-6-4){.pilcrow}

-   [a given packet P must be forwarded by router
    R;[¶](#section-6-5.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-6-5.1}

-   [the path along which P is to be forwarded is determined by BGP
    UPDATE U;[¶](#section-6-5.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-6-5.2}

-   ::: {#section-6-5.3}
    UPDATE U has a Tunnel Encapsulation attribute, containing at least
    one TLV that identifies a \"feasible tunnel\" for packet P. A tunnel
    is considered feasible if it has the following four
    properties:[¶](#section-6-5.3.1){.pilcrow}

    1.  [The tunnel type is supported (that is, router R knows how to
        set up tunnels of that type, how to create the encapsulation
        header for tunnels of that type,
        etc.).[¶](#section-6-5.3.2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-6-5.3.2.1}
    2.  [The tunnel is of a type that can be used to carry packet P (for
        example, an MPLS-in-UDP tunnel would not be a feasible tunnel
        for carrying an IP packet, unless the IP packet can first be
        encapsulated in a MPLS
        packet).[¶](#section-6-5.3.2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-6-5.3.2.2}
    3.  [The tunnel is specified in a TLV whose Tunnel Egress Endpoint
        sub-TLV identifies an IP address that is reachable. The
        reachability condition is evaluated as per
        \[[RFC4271](#RFC4271){.xref}\]. If the IP address is reachable
        via more than one forwarding table, local policy is used to
        determine which table to
        use.[¶](#section-6-5.3.2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-6-5.3.2.3}
    4.  [There is no local policy that prevents the use of the
        tunnel.[¶](#section-6-5.3.2.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-6-5.3.2.4}
    :::

Then router R [MUST]{.bcp14} send packet P through one of the feasible
tunnels identified in the Tunnel Encapsulation attribute of UPDATE
U.[¶](#section-6-6){.pilcrow}

If the Tunnel Encapsulation attribute contains several TLVs (that is, if
it specifies several feasible tunnels), router R may choose any one of
those tunnels, based upon local policy. If any Tunnel TLV contains one
or more Color sub-TLVs ([Section 3.4.2](#color){.xref}) and/or the
Protocol Type sub-TLV ([Section 3.4.1](#protocol-type){.xref}), the
choice of tunnel may be influenced by these sub-TLVs. Many other
factors, for example, minimization of encapsulation-header overhead,
could also be used to influence selection.[¶](#section-6-7){.pilcrow}

The reachability to the address of the egress endpoint of the tunnel may
change over time, directly impacting the feasibility of the tunnel. A
tunnel that is not feasible at some moment may become feasible at a
later time when its egress endpoint address is reachable. The router may
start using the newly feasible tunnel instead of an existing one. How
this decision is made is outside the scope of this
document.[¶](#section-6-8){.pilcrow}

Once it is determined to send a packet through the tunnel specified in a
particular Tunnel TLV of a particular Tunnel Encapsulation attribute,
then the tunnel\'s egress endpoint address is the IP address contained
in the Tunnel Egress Endpoint sub-TLV. If the Tunnel TLV contains a
Tunnel Egress Endpoint sub-TLV whose Value field is all zeroes, then the
tunnel\'s egress endpoint is the address of the next hop of the BGP
UPDATE containing the Tunnel Encapsulation attribute (that is, the
Network Address of Next Hop field of the MP_REACH_NLRI attribute if the
encoding of \[RFC4760\] is in use or the NEXT_HOP attribute otherwise).
The address of the tunnel egress endpoint generally appears in a
Destination Address field of the
encapsulation.[¶](#section-6-9){.pilcrow}

The full set of procedures for sending a packet through a particular
tunnel type to a particular tunnel egress endpoint depends upon the
tunnel type and is outside the scope of this document. Note that some
tunnel types may require the execution of an explicit tunnel setup
protocol before they can be used for carrying data. Other tunnel types
may not require any tunnel setup protocol.[¶](#section-6-10){.pilcrow}

Sending a packet through a tunnel always requires that the packet be
encapsulated, with an encapsulation header that is appropriate for the
tunnel type. The contents of the tunnel encapsulation header may be
influenced by the Encapsulation sub-TLV. If there is no Encapsulation
sub-TLV present, the router transmitting the packet through the tunnel
must have a priori knowledge (for example, by provisioning) of how to
fill in the various fields in the encapsulation
header.[¶](#section-6-11){.pilcrow}

A Tunnel Encapsulation attribute may contain several TLVs that all
specify the same tunnel type. Each TLV should be considered as
specifying a different tunnel. Two tunnels of the same type may have
different Tunnel Egress Endpoint sub-TLVs, different Encapsulation
sub-TLVs, etc. Choosing between two such tunnels is a matter of local
policy.[¶](#section-6-12){.pilcrow}

Once router R has decided to send packet P through a particular tunnel,
it encapsulates packet P appropriately and then forwards it according to
the route that leads to the tunnel\'s egress endpoint. This route may
itself be a BGP route with a Tunnel Encapsulation attribute. If so, the
encapsulated packet is treated as the payload and encapsulated according
to the Tunnel Encapsulation attribute of that route. That is, tunnels
may be \"stacked\".[¶](#section-6-13){.pilcrow}

Notwithstanding anything said in this document, a BGP speaker
[MAY]{.bcp14} have local policy that influences the choice of tunnel and
the way the encapsulation is formed. A BGP speaker [MAY]{.bcp14} also
have a local policy that tells it to ignore the Tunnel Encapsulation
attribute entirely or in part. Of course, interoperability issues must
be considered when such policies are put into
place.[¶](#section-6-14){.pilcrow}

The presence of the Tunnel Encapsulation attribute affects the BGP best
route-selection algorithm. If a route includes the Tunnel Encapsulation
attribute, and if that attribute includes no tunnel that is feasible,
then that route [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be considered resolvable for the

Consider a packet destined for address X. Suppose a BGP UPDATE for
address prefix X carries a Tunnel Encapsulation attribute that specifies
a tunnel egress endpoint of Y, and suppose that a BGP UPDATE for address
prefix Y carries a Tunnel Encapsulation attribute that specifies a
tunnel egress endpoint of X. It is easy to see that this can have no
good outcome. \[[RFC4271](#RFC4271){.xref}\] describes an analogous case
as mutually recursive routes.[¶](#section-7.2-1){.pilcrow}

This could happen as a result of misconfiguration, either accidental or
intentional. It could also happen if the Tunnel Encapsulation attribute
were altered by a malicious agent. Implementations should be aware that
such an attack will result in unresolvable BGP routes due to the
mutually recursive relationship. This document does not specify a
maximum number of recursions; that is an implementation-specific
matter.[¶](#section-7.2-2){.pilcrow}

Improper setting (or malicious altering) of the Tunnel Encapsulation
attribute could also cause data packets to loop. Suppose a BGP UPDATE
for address prefix X carries a Tunnel Encapsulation attribute that
specifies a tunnel egress endpoint of Y. Suppose router R receives and
processes the advertisement. When router R receives a packet destined
for X, it will apply the encapsulation and send the encapsulated packet
to Y. Y will decapsulate the packet and forward it further. If Y is
further away from X than is router R, it is possible that the path from
Y to X will traverse R. This would cause a long-lasting routing loop.
The control plane itself cannot detect this situation, though a TTL
field in the payload packets would prevent any given packet from looping
infinitely.[¶](#section-7.2-3){.pilcrow}

During the deployment of techniques described in this document,
operators are encouraged to avoid mutually recursive route and/or tunnel
dependencies. There is greater potential for such scenarios to arise
when the tunnel egress endpoint for a given prefix differs from the
address of the next hop for that prefix.[¶](#section-7.2-4){.pilcrow}

In a given UPDATE of a labeled address family, the label embedded in the
NLRI is generally a label that is meaningful only to the router
represented by the address of the next hop. Certain of the procedures of
Sections [9.2.2.1](#valid-vni){.xref} or [9.2.2.2](#no-valid-vni){.xref}
cause the embedded label to be carried by a data packet to the router
whose address appears in the Tunnel Egress Endpoint sub-TLV. If the
Tunnel Egress Endpoint sub-TLV does not identify the same router
represented by the address of the next hop, sending the packet through
the tunnel may cause the label to be misinterpreted at the tunnel\'s
egress endpoint. This may cause misdelivery of the packet. Avoidance of
this unfortunate outcome is a matter of network planning and design and
is outside the scope of this document.[¶](#section-10-1){.pilcrow}

Note that if the Tunnel Encapsulation attribute is attached to a VPN- IP
route \[[RFC4364](#RFC4364){.xref}\], if Inter-AS \"option b\" (see

granularities (for example, per route and/or per attribute TLV)

A potential operational difficulty arises when tunnels are used, if the
size of packets entering the tunnel exceeds the maximum transmission
unit (MTU) the tunnel is capable of supporting. This difficulty can be
exacerbated by stacking multiple tunnels, since each stacked tunnel
header further reduces the supportable MTU. This issue is long-standing
and well-known. The tunnel signaling provided in this specification does
nothing to address this issue, nor to aggravate it (except insofar as it
may further increase the popularity of
tunneling).[¶](#section-12-1){.pilcrow}

## [13.](#section-13){.section-number .selfRef} [Validation and Error Handling](#name-validation-and-error-handli){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-validation-and-error-handli}

The Tunnel Encapsulation attribute is a sequence of TLVs, each of which
is a sequence of sub-TLVs. The final octet of a TLV is determined by its
Length field. Similarly, the final octet of a sub- TLV is determined by
its Length field. The final octet of a TLV [MUST]{.bcp14} also be the
final octet of its final sub-TLV. If this is not the case, the TLV
[MUST]{.bcp14} be considered to be malformed, and the
\"Treat-as-withdraw\" procedure of \[[RFC7606](#RFC7606){.xref}\] is
applied.[¶](#section-13-1){.pilcrow}

If a Tunnel Encapsulation attribute does not have any valid TLVs, or it
does not have the transitive bit set, the \"Treat-as-withdraw\"
procedure of \[[RFC7606](#RFC7606){.xref}\] is
applied.[¶](#section-13-2){.pilcrow}

If a Tunnel Encapsulation attribute can be parsed correctly but contains
a TLV whose tunnel type is not recognized by a particular BGP speaker,
that BGP speaker [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} consider the attribute to be
malformed. Rather, it [MUST]{.bcp14} interpret the attribute as if that
TLV had not been present. If the route carrying the Tunnel Encapsulation
attribute is propagated with the attribute, the unrecognized TLV
[MUST]{.bcp14} remain in the attribute.[¶](#section-13-3){.pilcrow}

The following sub-TLVs defined in this document [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} occur
more than once in a given Tunnel TLV: Tunnel Egress Endpoint (discussed
below), Encapsulation, DS, UDP Destination Port, Embedded Label
Handling, MPLS Label Stack, and Prefix-SID. If a Tunnel TLV has more
than one of any of these sub-TLVs, all but the first occurrence of each
such sub-TLV type [MUST]{.bcp14} be disregarded. However, the Tunnel TLV
containing them [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be considered to be malformed, and
all the sub-TLVs [MUST]{.bcp14} be propagated if the route carrying the
Tunnel Encapsulation attribute is
propagated.[¶](#section-13-4){.pilcrow}

The following sub-TLVs defined in this document may appear zero or more
times in a given Tunnel TLV: Protocol Type and Color. Each occurrence of
such sub-TLVs is meaningful. For example, the Color sub-TLV may appear
multiple times to assign multiple colors to a
tunnel.[¶](#section-13-5){.pilcrow}

If a TLV of a Tunnel Encapsulation attribute contains a sub-TLV that is
not recognized by a particular BGP speaker, the BGP speaker
[MUST]{.bcp14} process that TLV as if the unrecognized sub-TLV had not
been present. If the route carrying the Tunnel Encapsulation attribute
is propagated with the attribute, the unrecognized sub-TLV
[MUST]{.bcp14} remain in the attribute.[¶](#section-13-6){.pilcrow}

In general, if a TLV contains a sub-TLV that is malformed, the sub-TLV
[MUST]{.bcp14} be treated as if it were an unrecognized sub-TLV. There
is one exception to this rule: if a TLV contains a malformed Tunnel
Egress Endpoint sub-TLV (as defined in [Section
3.1](#tunnel-egress-endpoint){.xref}), the entire TLV [MUST]{.bcp14} be
ignored and [MUST]{.bcp14} be removed from the Tunnel Encapsulation
attribute before the route carrying that attribute is
distributed.[¶](#section-13-7){.pilcrow}

Within a Tunnel Encapsulation attribute that is carried by a BGP UPDATE
whose AFI/SAFI is one of those explicitly listed in the first paragraph
of [Section 6](#usage){.xref}, a TLV that does not contain exactly one
Tunnel Egress Endpoint sub-TLV [MUST]{.bcp14} be treated as if it
contained a malformed Tunnel Egress Endpoint
sub-TLV.[¶](#section-13-8){.pilcrow}

A TLV identifying a particular tunnel type may contain a sub-TLV that is
meaningless for that tunnel type. For example, perhaps the TLV contains
a UDP Destination Port sub-TLV, but the identified tunnel type does not
use UDP encapsulation at all, or a tunnel of the form \"X-in-Y\"
contains a Protocol Type sub-TLV that specifies something other than
\"X\". Sub-TLVs of this sort [MUST]{.bcp14} be disregarded. That is,
they [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} affect the creation of the encapsulation header.
However, the sub-TLV [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be considered to be malformed
and [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be removed from the TLV before the route carrying
the Tunnel Encapsulation attribute is distributed. An implementation
[MAY]{.bcp14} log a message when it encounters such a
sub-TLV.[¶](#section-13-9){.pilcrow}

## [15.](#section-15){.section-number .selfRef} [Security Considerations](#name-security-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-security-considerations}

As [Section 11](#scoping){.xref} discusses, it is intended that the
Tunnel Encapsulation attribute be used only within a well-defined scope,
for example, within a set of ASes that belong to a single administrative
entity. As long as the filtering mechanisms discussed in that section
are applied diligently, an attacker outside the scope would not be able
to use the Tunnel Encapsulation attribute in an attack. This leaves open
the questions of attackers within the scope (for example, a compromised
router) and failures in filtering that allow an external attack to
succeed.[¶](#section-15-1){.pilcrow}

As \[[RFC4272](#RFC4272){.xref}\] discusses, BGP is vulnerable to
traffic-diversion attacks. The Tunnel Encapsulation attribute adds a new
means by which an attacker could cause traffic to be diverted from its
normal path, especially when the Tunnel Egress Endpoint sub-TLV is used.
Such an attack would differ from pre-existing vulnerabilities in that
traffic could be tunneled to a distant target across intervening network
infrastructure, allowing an attack to potentially succeed more easily,
since less infrastructure would have to be subverted. Potential
consequences include \"hijacking\" of traffic (insertion of an undesired
node in the path, which allows for inspection or modification of
traffic, or avoidance of security controls) or denial of service
(directing traffic to a node that doesn\'t desire to receive
it).[¶](#section-15-2){.pilcrow}

In order to further mitigate the risk of diversion of traffic from its
intended destination, [Section 3.1.1](#address-validation){.xref}
provides an optional procedure to check that the destination given in a
Tunnel Egress Endpoint sub-TLV is within the AS that was the source of
the route. One then has some level of assurance that the tunneled
traffic is going to the same destination AS that it would have gone to
had the Tunnel Encapsulation attribute not been present. As RFC 4272
discusses, it\'s possible for an attacker to announce an inaccurate
AS_PATH; therefore, an attacker with the ability to inject a Tunnel
Egress Endpoint sub-TLV could equally craft an AS_PATH that would pass
the validation procedures of [Section
3.1.1](#address-validation){.xref}. BGP origin validation
\[[RFC6811](#RFC6811){.xref}\] and BGPsec \[[RFC8205](#RFC8205){.xref}\]
provide means to increase assurance that the origins being validated
have not been falsified.[¶](#section-15-3){.pilcrow}

Many tunnels carry traffic that embeds a destination address that comes
from a non-global namespace. One example is MPLS VPNs. If a tunnel
crosses from one namespace to another, without the necessary translation
being performed for the embedded address(es), there exists a risk of
misdelivery of traffic. If the traffic contains confidential data
that\'s not otherwise protected (for example, by end-to-end encryption),
then confidential information could be revealed. The restriction of
applicability of the Tunnel Encapsulation attribute to a well-defined
scope limits the likelihood of this occurring. See the discussion of
\"option b\" in [Section 10](#applicability){.xref} for further
discussion of one such scenario.[¶](#section-15-4){.pilcrow}

RFC 8402 specifies that \"SR domain boundary routers [MUST]{.bcp14}
filter any external traffic\" (\[[RFC8402](#RFC8402){.xref}\], [Section
8.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8402#section-8.1){.relref}). For
these purposes, traffic introduced into an SR domain using the
Prefix-SID sub-TLV lies within the SR domain, even though the
Prefix-SIDs used by the routers at the two ends of the tunnel may be
different, as discussed in [Section 3.7](#prefix-sid){.xref}. This
implies that the duty to filter external traffic extends to all routers
participating in such tunnels.[¶](#section-15-5){.pilcrow}

## [Appendix A.](#section-appendix.a){.section-number .selfRef} [Impact on RFC 8365](#name-impact-on-rfc-8365){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-impact-on-rfc-8365}

\[[RFC8365](#RFC8365){.xref}\] references RFC 5512 for its definition of
the BGP Encapsulation Extended Community. That extended community is now
defined in this document, in a way consistent with its previous
definition.[¶](#section-appendix.a-1){.pilcrow}

[Section 6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8365#section-6){.relref}
of \[[RFC8365](#RFC8365){.xref}\] talks about the use of the
Encapsulation Extended Community to allow Network Virtualization Edge
(NVE) devices to signal their supported encapsulations. We note that
with the introduction of this specification, the Tunnel Encapsulation
attribute can also be used for this purpose. For purposes where RFC 8365
talks about \"advertising supported encapsulations\" (for example, in
the second paragraph of Section
[6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8365#section-6){.relref}),
encapsulations advertised using the Tunnel Encapsulation attribute
should be considered equally with those advertised using the
Encapsulation Extended Community.[¶](#section-appendix.a-2){.pilcrow}

In particular, a review of [Section
8.3.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8365#section-8.3.1){.relref} of
\[[RFC8365](#RFC8365){.xref}\] is called for, to consider whether the
introduction of the Tunnel Encapsulation attribute creates a need for
any revisions to the split-horizon
procedures.[¶](#section-appendix.a-3){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC8365](#RFC8365){.xref}\] also refers to a draft version of this
specification in the final paragraph of Section
[5.1.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8365#section-5.1.3){.relref}.
That paragraph references Section 8.2.2.2 of the draft. In this
document, the correct reference would be [Section
9.2.2.2](#no-valid-vni){.xref}. There are no substantive differences
between the section in the referenced draft version and that in this
document.[¶](#section-appendix.a-4){.pilcrow}
