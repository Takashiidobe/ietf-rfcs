This document introduces the Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP)
architecture \[[RFC9300](#RFC9300){.cite .xref}\]
\[[RFC9301](#RFC9301){.cite .xref}\], its main operational mechanisms,
and its design rationale. Fundamentally, LISP is built following a
well-known architectural idea: decoupling the overloaded semantics of IP
addresses. As pointed out by [Noel Chiappa]{.contact-name}
\[[RFC4984](#RFC4984){.cite .xref}\], currently, IP addresses identify
both the topological location of a network attachment point as well as
the node\'s identity. However, nodes and routing have fundamentally
different requirements. On one hand, routing systems require that
addresses be aggregatable and have topological meaning; on the other
hand, nodes must be identified independently of their current location
\[[RFC4984](#RFC4984){.cite .xref}\].[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

LISP creates two separate namespaces, Endpoint Identifiers (EIDs) and
Routing Locators (RLOCs). Both are syntactically identical to the
current IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. However, EIDs are used to uniquely
identify nodes irrespective of their topological location and are
typically routed intra-domain. RLOCs are assigned topologically to
network attachment points and are typically routed inter-domain. With
LISP, the edge of the Internet (where the nodes are connected) and the
core (where inter-domain routing occurs) can be logically separated.
LISP-capable routers interconnect the two logical spaces. LISP also
introduces a database, called the Mapping System, to store and retrieve
mappings between identity and location. LISP-capable routers exchange
packets over the Internet core by encapsulating them to the appropriate
location.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

In summary:[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

-   [RLOCs have meaning only in the underlay network, that is, the
    underlying core routing
    system.[¶](#section-1-4.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-4.1}
-   [EIDs have meaning only in the overlay network, which is the
    encapsulation relationship between LISP-capable
    routers.[¶](#section-1-4.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-4.2}
-   [The LISP edge maps EIDs to
    RLOCs.[¶](#section-1-4.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-4.3}
-   [Within the underlay network, RLOCs have both Locator and identifier
    semantics.[¶](#section-1-4.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-4.4}
-   [An EID within a LISP site carries both identifier and Locator
    semantics to other nodes within that
    site.[¶](#section-1-4.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-4.5}
-   [An EID within a LISP site carries identifier and limited Locator
    semantics to nodes at other LISP sites (i.e., enough Locator
    information to tell that the EID is external to the
    site).[¶](#section-1-4.6){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-4.6}

The relationship described above is not unique to LISP, and it is common
to other overlay technologies.[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}

The initial motivation in the LISP effort is to be found in the routing
scalability problem \[[RFC4984](#RFC4984){.cite .xref}\], where, if LISP
were to be completely deployed, the Internet core is populated with
RLOCs while Traffic Engineering (TE) mechanisms are pushed to the
Mapping System. In such a scenario, RLOCs are quasi-static (i.e., low
churn), hence making the routing system scalable
\[[Quoitin](#Quoitin){.cite .xref}\], while EIDs can roam anywhere with
no churn to the underlying global routing system.
\[[RFC7215](#RFC7215){.cite .xref}\] discusses the impact of LISP on the
global routing system during the transition period. However, the
separation between location and identity that LISP offers makes it
suitable for use in additional scenarios, such as TE, multihoming, and
mobility among others.[¶](#section-1-6){.pilcrow}

This document describes the LISP architecture and its main operational
mechanisms as well as its design rationale. It is important to note that
this document does not specify or complement LISP. The interested reader
should refer to the main LISP specifications (see
\[[RFC9300](#RFC9300){.cite .xref}\] and \[[RFC9301](#RFC9301){.cite
.xref}\]), as well as the complementary documents (i.e.,

\[[RFC6835](#RFC6835){.cite .xref}\], \[[RFC6836](#RFC6836){.cite
.xref}\], and \[[RFC7052](#RFC7052){.cite .xref}\]) for the protocol
specifications along with the LISP deployment guidelines

### [3.1.](#section-3.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Design Principles](#name-design-principles){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-design-principles}

The LISP architecture is built on top of four basic design
principles:[¶](#section-3.1-1){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

Locator/Identifier split:
:   Decoupling the overloaded semantics of current IP addresses allows
    devices to have identity-based addresses that are separate from
    topologically meaningful addresses. By allowing only the
    topologically meaningful addresses to be exposed to the Internet
    core, those topologically meaningful addresses can be aggregated to
    support substantial scaling. Individual devices are assigned
    identity-based addresses that are not used for forwarding in the
    Internet core.[¶](#section-3.1-2.2){.pilcrow}
:   

Overlay architecture:
:   This architecture overlays route packets over the current Internet,
    allowing deployment of new protocols without changing the current
    infrastructure; hence, this results in a low deployment
    cost.[¶](#section-3.1-2.4){.pilcrow}
:   

Decoupled data plane and control plane:
:   Separating the data plane from the control plane allows them to
    scale independently and use different architectural approaches. This
    is important given that they typically have different requirements
    and allows for other data planes to be added. Even though the data
    plane and the control plane are decoupled, they are not completely
    isolated, because the LISP data plane may trigger control plane
    activity.[¶](#section-3.1-2.6){.pilcrow}
:   

Incremental deployability:
:   This principle ensures that the protocol interoperates with the
    legacy Internet while providing some of the targeted benefits to
    early adopters.[¶](#section-3.1-2.8){.pilcrow}

### [3.2.](#section-3.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Overview of the Architecture](#name-overview-of-the-architectur){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-overview-of-the-architectur}

LISP architecturally splits the core from the edge of the Internet by
creating two separate namespaces: Endpoint Identifiers (EIDs) and
Routing Locators (RLOCs). The edge consists of LISP sites (e.g., an
Autonomous System) that use EID addresses. EIDs are IPv4 or IPv6
addresses that uniquely identify communication end hosts and are
assigned and configured by the same mechanisms that exist at the time of
this writing. EIDs do not contain inter-domain topological information,
and because of this, EIDs are usually routable at the edge (within LISP
sites) but not in the core; see [Section 3.5](#sect-3.5){.auto .internal
.xref} for discussion of LISP site internetworking with non-LISP sites
and domains in the Internet.[¶](#section-3.2-1){.pilcrow}

LISP sites (at the edge) are connected to the interconnecting core of
the Internet by means of LISP-capable routers (e.g., border routers).
LISP sites are connected across the interconnecting core of the Internet
using tunnels between the LISP-capable routers. When packets originated
from a LISP site are flowing towards the core network, they ingress into
an encapsulated tunnel via an Ingress Tunnel Router (ITR). When packets
flow from the core network to a LISP site, they egress from an
encapsulated tunnel to an Egress Tunnel Router (ETR). An xTR is a router
that can perform both ITR and ETR operations. In this context, ITRs
encapsulate packets, while ETRs decapsulate them; hence, LISP operates
as an overlay on top of the current Internet
core.[¶](#section-3.2-2){.pilcrow}

[Figure 1](#figure-1){.selfRef}: [A Schema of the LISP
Architecture](#name-a-schema-of-the-lisp-archit){.selfRef}

With LISP, the core uses RLOCs. An RLOC is an IPv4 or IPv6 address
assigned to a core-facing network interface of an ITR or
ETR.[¶](#section-3.2-4){.pilcrow}

A database that is typically distributed, called the Mapping System,
stores mappings between EIDs and RLOCs. Such mappings relate the
identity of the devices attached to LISP sites (EIDs) to the set of
RLOCs configured at the LISP-capable routers servicing the site.
Furthermore, the mappings also include TE policies and can be configured
to achieve multihoming and load balancing. The LISP Mapping System is
conceptually similar to the DNS, where it is organized as a distributed
multi-organization network database. With LISP, ETRs register mappings,
while ITRs retrieve them.[¶](#section-3.2-5){.pilcrow}

Finally, the LISP architecture emphasizes incremental deployment. Given
that LISP represents an overlay to the current Internet architecture,
end hosts, as well as intra-domain and inter-domain routers, remain
unchanged. The only required changes to the existing infrastructure are
to routers connecting the EID space with the RLOC space. Additionally,
LISP requires the deployment of an independent Mapping System; such a
distributed database is a new network
entity.[¶](#section-3.2-6){.pilcrow}

The following describes a simplified packet flow sequence between two
nodes that are attached to LISP sites. Please note that typical
LISP-capable routers are xTRs (both ITR and ETR). Client HostA wants to
send a packet to server HostB.[¶](#section-3.2-7){.pilcrow}

1.  [HostA retrieves the EID_B of HostB, typically querying the DNS and
    obtaining an A or AAAA record. Then, it generates an IP packet as in
    the Internet. The packet has source address EID_A and destination
    address EID_B.[¶](#section-3.2-9.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.2-9.1}
2.  [The packet is forwarded towards ITR_A in the LISP site using
    standard intra-domain

3.  [ITR_A, upon receiving the packet, queries the Mapping System to
    retrieve the Locator of ETR_B that is servicing HostB\'s EID_B. In
    order to do so, it uses a LISP control message called Map-Request.
    The message contains EID_B as the lookup key. In turn, it receives
    another LISP control message called Map-Reply. The message contains
    two Locators: RLOC_B1 and RLOC_B2. It also contains TE policies:
    priority and weight per Locator. Note that a Map-Reply can contain
    more Locators if needed. ITR_A can cache the mapping in local
    storage to speed up forwarding of subsequent
    packets.[¶](#section-3.2-9.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.2-9.3}
4.  [ITR_A encapsulates the packet towards RLOC_B1 (chosen according to
    the priorities/weights specified in the mapping). The packet
    contains two IP headers. The outer header has RLOC_A1 as source and
    RLOC_B1 as destination. The inner original header has EID_A as
    source and EID_B as destination. Furthermore, ITR_A adds a LISP
    header. More details about LISP encapsulation can be found in

### [3.3.](#section-3.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Data Plane](#name-data-plane){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-data-plane}

This section provides a high-level description of the LISP data plane,
which is specified in detail in \[[RFC9300](#RFC9300){.cite .xref}\].
The LISP data plane is responsible for encapsulating and decapsulating
data packets and caching the appropriate forwarding state. It includes
two main entities, the ITR and the ETR. Both are LISP-capable routers
that connect the EID with the RLOC space (ITR) and vice versa
(ETR).[¶](#section-3.3-1){.pilcrow}

::: {#encapsulation}

#### [3.3.1.](#section-3.3.1){.section-number .selfRef} [LISP Encapsulation](#name-lisp-encapsulation){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-lisp-encapsulation}

ITRs encapsulate data packets towards ETRs. LISP data packets are
encapsulated using UDP (port 4341). The source port is usually selected
by the ITR using a 5-tuple hash of the inner header (so as to be
consistent in case of multipath solutions, such as ECMP
\[[RFC2992](#RFC2992){.cite .xref}\]) and ignored on reception. LISP
data packets are often encapsulated in UDP packets that include a zero
checksum \[[RFC6935](#RFC6935){.cite .xref}\]
\[[RFC6936](#RFC6936){.cite .xref}\] that may not be verified when it is
received, because LISP data packets typically include an inner transport
protocol header with a non-zero checksum. The use of UDP zero checksums
over IPv6 for all tunneling protocols like LISP is subject to the
applicability statement in \[[RFC6936](#RFC6936){.cite .xref}\]. If LISP
data packets are encapsulated in UDP packets with non-zero checksums,
the outer UDP checksums are verified when the UDP packets are received,
as part of normal UDP processing.[¶](#section-3.3.1-1){.pilcrow}

LISP-encapsulated packets also include a LISP header (after the UDP
header and before the original IP header). The LISP header is prepended
by ITRs and stripped by ETRs. It carries reachability information (see
more details in [Section 4.2](#reachability){.auto .internal .xref}) and
the \'Instance ID\' field. The \'Instance ID\' field is used to
distinguish traffic to/from different tenant address spaces at the LISP
site, and this use of the Instance ID may use overlapped but logically
separated EID addressing.[¶](#section-3.3.1-2){.pilcrow}

Overall, LISP works on 4 headers: the inner header the source
constructed and the 3 headers a LISP encapsulator prepends (\"outer\" to
\"inner\"):[¶](#section-3.3.1-3){.pilcrow}

1.  [Outer IP header containing RLOCs as source and destination
    addresses. This header is originated by ITRs and stripped by
    ETRs.[¶](#section-3.3.1-4.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.3.1-4.1}
2.  [UDP header (port 4341), usually with zero checksum. This header is
    originated by ITRs and stripped by
    ETRs.[¶](#section-3.3.1-4.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.3.1-4.2}
3.  [LISP header that contains various forwarding-plane features (such
    as reachability) and an \'Instance ID\' field. This header is
    originated by ITRs and stripped by
    ETRs.[¶](#section-3.3.1-4.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.3.1-4.3}
4.  [Inner IP header containing EIDs as source and destination
    addresses. This header is created by the source end host and is left
    unchanged by the LISP data plane processing on the ITR and
    ETR.[¶](#section-3.3.1-4.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.3.1-4.4}

Finally, in some scenarios, re-encapsulating and/or recursive tunnels
are useful to choose a specified path in the underlay network, for
instance, to avoid congestion or failure. Re-encapsulating tunnels are
consecutive LISP tunnels and occur when a decapsulator (an ETR action)
removes a LISP header and then acts as an encapsulator (an ITR action)
to prepend another one. On the other hand, recursive tunnels are nested
tunnels and are implemented by using multiple LISP encapsulations on a
packet. Such functions are implemented by Re-encapsulating Tunnel
Routers (RTRs). An RTR can be thought of as a router that first acts as
an ETR by decapsulating packets and then as an ITR by encapsulating them
towards another Locator; more information can be found in
\[[RFC9300](#RFC9300){.cite .xref}\] and \[[RFC9301](#RFC9301){.cite
.xref}\].[¶](#section-3.3.1-5){.pilcrow}

In the LISP architecture, ITRs keep just enough information to route
traffic flowing through them. In other words, ITRs only need to retrieve
from the LISP Mapping System mappings between EID-Prefixes (blocks of
EIDs) and RLOCs that are used to encapsulate packets. Such mappings are
stored in a local cache called the LISP Map-Cache for subsequent packets
addressed to the same EID-Prefix. Note that in the case of overlapping
EID-Prefixes, after a request, the ITR may receive a set of mappings
covering the requested EID-Prefix and all more-specific EID-Prefixes
(cf., [Section
5.5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9301#section-5.5){.relref} of
\[[RFC9301](#RFC9301){.cite .xref}\]). Mappings include a Time to Live
(TTL) (set by the ETR). More details about the Map-Cache management can

The LISP control plane, specified in \[[RFC9301](#RFC9301){.cite
.xref}\], provides a standard interface to register and request
mappings. The LISP Mapping System is a database that stores such
mappings. The following sub-sections first describe the mappings, then
the standard interface to the Mapping System, and finally its
architecture.[¶](#section-3.4-1){.pilcrow}

#### [3.4.1.](#section-3.4.1){.section-number .selfRef} [LISP Mappings](#name-lisp-mappings){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-lisp-mappings}

Each mapping includes the bindings between EID-Prefix(es) and a set of
RLOCs as well as TE policies, in the form of priorities and weights for
the RLOCs. Priorities allow the ETR to configure active/backup policies,
while weights are used to load-balance traffic among the RLOCs (on a
per-flow basis).[¶](#section-3.4.1-1){.pilcrow}

Typical mappings in LISP bind EIDs in the form of IP prefixes with a set
of RLOCs, also in the form of IP addresses. IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are
encoded using the appropriate Address Family Identifier (AFI)
\[[RFC8060](#RFC8060){.cite .xref}\]. However, LISP can also support
more general address encoding by means of the ongoing effort around the
LISP Canonical Address Format (LCAF) \[[RFC8060](#RFC8060){.cite
.xref}\].[¶](#section-3.4.1-2){.pilcrow}

With such a general syntax for address encoding in place, LISP aims to
provide flexibility to current and future applications. For instance,
LCAFs could support Media Access Control (MAC) addresses,
geocoordinates, ASCII names, and application-specific
data.[¶](#section-3.4.1-3){.pilcrow}

LISP defines a standard interface between data and control planes. The
interface is specified in \[[RFC9301](#RFC9301){.cite .xref}\] and
defines two entities:[¶](#section-3.4.2-1){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

Map-Server:
:   A network infrastructure component that learns mappings from ETRs
    and publishes them into the LISP Mapping System. Typically,
    Map-Servers are not authoritative to reply to queries; hence, they
    forward them to the ETR. However, they can also operate in
    proxy-mode, where the ETRs delegate replying to queries to
    Map-Servers. This setup is useful when the ETR has limited resources
    (e.g., CPU or power).[¶](#section-3.4.2-2.2){.pilcrow}
:   

Map-Resolver:
:   A network infrastructure component that interfaces ITRs with the
    Mapping System by proxying queries and, in some cases,
    responses.[¶](#section-3.4.2-2.4){.pilcrow}
:   

The interface defines four LISP control messages that are sent as UDP
datagrams (port 4342):[¶](#section-3.4.2-3){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

Map-Register:
:   This message is used by ETRs to register mappings in the Mapping
    System, and it is authenticated using a shared key between the ETR
    and the Map-Server.[¶](#section-3.4.2-4.2){.pilcrow}
:   

Map-Notify:
:   When requested by the ETR, this message is sent by the Map-Server in
    response to a Map-Register to acknowledge the correct reception of
    the mapping and convey the latest Map-Server state on the
    EID-to-RLOC mapping. In some cases, a Map-Notify can be sent to the
    previous RLOCs when an EID is registered by a new set of
    RLOCs.[¶](#section-3.4.2-4.4){.pilcrow}
:   

Map-Request:
:   This message is used by ITRs or Map-Resolvers to resolve the mapping
    of a given EID.[¶](#section-3.4.2-4.6){.pilcrow}
:   

Map-Reply:
:   This message is sent by Map-Servers or ETRs in response to a
    Map-Request and contains the resolved mapping. Please note that a
    Map-Reply may contain a negative reply if, for example, the queried
    EID is not part of the LISP EID space. In such cases, the ITR
    typically forwards the traffic as is (non-encapsulated) to the
    public Internet. This behavior is defined to support incremental
    deployment of LISP.[¶](#section-3.4.2-4.8){.pilcrow}

:::

::: {#section-3.4.3 .section}
#### [3.4.3.](#section-3.4.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Mapping System](#name-mapping-system){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-mapping-system}

LISP architecturally decouples control and data planes by means of a
standard interface. This interface glues the data plane \-- routers
responsible for forwarding data packets \-- with the LISP Mapping System
\-- a database responsible for storing
mappings.[¶](#section-3.4.3-1){.pilcrow}

With this separation in place, the data and control planes can use
different architectures if needed and scale independently. Typically,
the data plane is optimized to route packets according to hierarchical
IP addresses. However, the control plane may have different
requirements, for instance, and by taking advantage of the LCAFs, the
Mapping System may be used to store nonhierarchical keys (such as MAC
addresses), requiring different architectural approaches for
scalability. Another important difference between the LISP control and
data planes is that, and as a result of the local mapping cache
available at the ITR, the Mapping System does not need to operate at
line-rate.[¶](#section-3.4.3-2){.pilcrow}

Many of the existing mechanisms to create distributed systems have been
explored and considered for the Mapping System architecture: graph-based
databases in the form of LISP Alternative Logical Topology (LISP-ALT)
\[[RFC6836](#RFC6836){.cite .xref}\], hierarchical databases in the form
of the LISP Delegated Database Tree (LISP-DDT)
\[[RFC8111](#RFC8111){.cite .xref}\], monolithic databases in the form
of the LISP Not-so-novel EID-to-RLOC Database (LISP-NERD)
\[[RFC6837](#RFC6837){.cite .xref}\], flat databases in the form of the
LISP Distributed Hash Table (LISP-DHT)
\[[LISP-SHDHT](#I-D.cheng-lisp-shdht){.cite .xref}\]
\[[Mathy](#Mathy){.cite .xref}\], and a multicast-based database
\[[LISP-EMACS](#I-D.curran-lisp-emacs){.cite .xref}\]. Furthermore, it
is worth noting that, in some scenarios, such as private deployments,
the Mapping System can operate as logically centralized. In such cases,
it is typically composed of a single
Map-Server/Map-Resolver.[¶](#section-3.4.3-3){.pilcrow}

The following sub-sections focus on the two Mapping Systems that have
been implemented and deployed (LISP-ALT and
LISP-DDT).[¶](#section-3.4.3-4){.pilcrow}

##### [3.4.3.1.](#section-3.4.3.1){.section-number .selfRef} [LISP-ALT](#name-lisp-alt){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-lisp-alt}

LISP-ALT \[[RFC6836](#RFC6836){.cite .xref}\] was the first Mapping
System proposed, developed, and deployed on the LISP pilot network. It
is based on a distributed BGP overlay in which Map-Servers and
Map-Resolvers participate. The nodes connect to their peers through
static tunnels. Each Map-Server involved in the ALT topology advertises
the EID-Prefixes registered by the serviced ETRs, making the EID
routable on the ALT topology.[¶](#section-3.4.3.1-1){.pilcrow}

When an ITR needs a mapping, it sends a Map-Request to a Map-Resolver
that, using the ALT topology, forwards the Map-Request towards the
Map-Server responsible for the mapping. Upon reception, the Map-Server
forwards the request to the ETR, which in turn replies directly to the
ITR.[¶](#section-3.4.3.1-2){.pilcrow}

LISP-DDT \[[RFC8111](#RFC8111){.cite .xref}\] is conceptually similar to
the DNS, a hierarchical directory whose internal structure mirrors the
hierarchical nature of the EID address space. The DDT hierarchy is
composed of DDT nodes forming a tree structure; the leafs of the tree
are Map-Servers. On top of the structure, there is the DDT root node,
which is a particular instance of a DDT node, that matches the entire
address space. As in the case of DNS, DDT supports multiple redundant
DDT nodes and/or DDT roots. Finally, Map-Resolvers are the clients of
the DDT hierarchy and can query the DDT root and/or other DDT
nodes.[¶](#section-3.4.3.2-1){.pilcrow}

Tree Structure](#name-a-schematic-representation-){.selfRef}

Please note that the prefixes and the structure depicted in the figure
above should only be considered as an
example.[¶](#section-3.4.3.2-3){.pilcrow}

The DDT structure does not actually index EID-Prefixes; rather, it
indexes Extended EID-Prefixes (XEID-Prefixes). An XEID-Prefix is just
the concatenation of the following fields (from most significant bit to
less significant bits): Database-ID, Instance ID, Address Family
Identifier, and the actual EID-Prefix. The Database-ID is provided for
possible future requirements of higher levels in the hierarchy and to
enable the creation of multiple and separate database
trees.[¶](#section-3.4.3.2-4){.pilcrow}

In order to resolve a query, LISP-DDT operates in a similar way to the
DNS but only supports iterative lookups. DDT clients (usually
Map-Resolvers) generate Map-Requests to the DDT root node. In response,
they receive a newly introduced LISP control message: a Map-Referral. A
Map-Referral provides the list of RLOCs of the set of DDT nodes matching
a configured XEID delegation. That is, the information contained in the
Map-Referral points to the child of the queried DDT node that has more
specific information about the queried XEID-Prefix. This process is
repeated until the DDT client walks the tree structure (downwards) and
discovers the Map-Server servicing the queried XEID. At this point, the
client sends a Map-Request and receives a Map-Reply containing the
mappings. It is important to note that DDT clients can also cache the
information contained in Map-Referrals; that is, they cache the DDT
structure. This is used to reduce the time required to retrieve mappings
\[[Jakab](#Jakab){.cite .xref}\].[¶](#section-3.4.3.2-5){.pilcrow}

The DDT Mapping System relies on manual configuration. That is,
Map-Resolvers are configured with the set of available DDT root nodes,
while DDT nodes are configured with the appropriate XEID delegations.
Configuration changes in the DDT nodes are only required when the tree
structure changes itself, but it doesn\'t depend on EID dynamics (RLOC
allocation or TE policy changes).[¶](#section-3.4.3.2-6){.pilcrow}

result, LISP requires an internetworking mechanism to allow LISP sites
to speak with non-LISP sites and vice versa. LISP internetworking
mechanisms are specified in \[[RFC6832](#RFC6832){.cite
.xref}\].[¶](#section-3.5-1){.pilcrow}

LISP defines two entities to provide
internetworking:[¶](#section-3.5-2){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

Proxy Ingress Tunnel Router (PITR):
:   PITRs provide connectivity from the legacy Internet to LISP sites.
    PITRs announce in the global routing system blocks of EID-Prefixes
    (aggregating when possible) to attract traffic. For each incoming
    packet from a source not in a LISP site (a non-EID), the PITR
    LISP-encapsulates it towards the RLOC(s) of the appropriate LISP
    site. The impact of PITRs on the routing table size of the
    Default-Free Zone (DFZ) is, in the worst case, similar to the case
    in which LISP is not deployed. EID-Prefixes will be aggregated as
    much as possible, both by the PITR and by the global routing
    system.[¶](#section-3.5-3.2){.pilcrow}
:   

Proxy Egress Tunnel Router (PETR):
:   PETRs provide connectivity from LISP sites to the legacy Internet.
    In some scenarios, LISP sites may be unable to send encapsulated
    packets with a local EID address as a source to the legacy Internet,
    for instance, when Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding (uRPF) is used by
    Provider Edge routers or when an intermediate network between a LISP
    site and a non-LISP site does not support the desired version of IP
    (IPv4 or IPv6). In both cases, the PETR overcomes such limitations
    by encapsulating packets over the network. There is no specified
    provision for the distribution of PETR RLOC addresses to the
    ITRs.[¶](#section-3.5-3.4){.pilcrow}
:   

Additionally, LISP also defines mechanisms to operate with private EIDs
\[[RFC1918](#RFC1918){.cite .xref}\] by means of LISP-NAT
\[[RFC6832](#RFC6832){.cite .xref}\]. In this case, the xTR replaces a
private EID source address with a routable one. At the time of this
writing, work is ongoing to define NAT-traversal capabilities, that is,
xTRs behind a NAT using non-routable RLOCs.[¶](#section-3.5-4){.pilcrow}

PITRs, PETRs, and LISP-NAT enable incremental deployment of LISP by
providing significant flexibility in the placement of the boundaries
between the LISP and non-LISP portions of the network and making it easy
to change those boundaries over time.[¶](#section-3.5-5){.pilcrow}

### [4.1.](#section-4.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Cache Management](#name-cache-management){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-cache-management}

LISP\'s decoupled control and data planes, where mappings are stored in
the control plane and used for forwarding in the data plane, require a
local cache in ITRs to reduce signaling overhead (Map-Request/Map-Reply)
and increase forwarding speed. The local cache available at the ITRs,
called Map-Cache, is used by the router to LISP-encapsulate packets. The
Map-Cache is indexed by (Instance ID, EID-Prefix) and contains basically
the set of RLOCs with the associated TE policies (priorities and
weights).[¶](#section-4.1-1){.pilcrow}

The Map-Cache, as with any other cache, requires cache coherence
mechanisms to maintain up-to-date information. LISP defines three main
mechanisms for cache coherence:[¶](#section-4.1-2){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

Record Time To Live (TTL):
:   Each mapping record contains a TTL set by the ETR. Upon expiration
    of the TTL, the ITR can\'t use the mapping until it is refreshed by
    sending a new Map-Request.[¶](#section-4.1-3.2){.pilcrow}
:   

Solicit-Map-Request (SMR):
:   SMR is an explicit mechanism to update mapping information. In
    particular, a special type of Map-Request can be sent on demand by
    ETRs to request refreshing a mapping. Upon reception of an SMR
    message, the ITR must refresh the bindings by sending a Map-Request
    to the Mapping System. Further uses of SMRs are documented in
    \[[RFC9301](#RFC9301){.cite .xref}\].[¶](#section-4.1-3.4){.pilcrow}
:   

Map-Versioning:
:   This optional mechanism piggybacks, in the LISP header of data
    packets, the version number of the mappings used by an xTR. This
    way, when an xTR receives a LISP-encapsulated packet from a remote
    xTR, it can check whether its own Map-Cache or the one of the remote
    xTR is outdated. If its Map-Cache is outdated, it sends a
    Map-Request for the remote EID so as to obtain the newest mappings.
    On the contrary, if it detects that the remote xTR Map-Cache is
    outdated, it sends an SMR to notify it that a new mapping is
    available. Further details are available in
    \[[RFC9302](#RFC9302){.cite .xref}\].[¶](#section-4.1-3.6){.pilcrow}
:   

Finally, it is worth noting that, in some cases, an entry in the
Map-Cache can be proactively refreshed using the mechanisms described in
the section below.[¶](#section-4.1-4){.pilcrow}

### [4.2.](#section-4.2){.section-number .selfRef} [RLOC Reachability](#name-rloc-reachability){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-rloc-reachability}

In most cases, LISP operates with a pull-based Mapping System (e.g.,
DDT). This results in an edge-to-edge pull architecture. In such a
scenario, the network state is stored in the control plane while the
data plane pulls it on demand. This has consequences concerning the
propagation of xTRs\' reachability/liveness information, since pull
architectures require explicit mechanisms to propagate this information.
As a result, LISP defines a set of mechanisms to inform ITRs and PITRs
about the reachability of the cached RLOCs:[¶](#section-4.2-1){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

Locator-Status-Bits (LSBs):
:   Using LSBs is a passive technique. The \'LSB\' field is carried by
    data packets in the LISP header and can be set by ETRs to specify
    which RLOCs of the ETR site are up/down. This information can be
    used by the ITRs as a hint about the reachability to perform
    additional checks. Also note that LSBs do not provide path
    reachability status; they only provide hints about the status of
    RLOCs. As such, they must not be used over the public Internet and
    should be coupled with Map-Versioning to prevent race conditions
    where LSBs are interpreted as referring to different RLOCs than
    intended.[¶](#section-4.2-2.2){.pilcrow}
:   

Echo-Nonce:
:   This is also a passive technique that can only operate effectively
    when data flows bidirectionally between two communicating xTRs.
    Basically, an ITR piggybacks a random number (called a nonce) in
    LISP data packets. If the path and the probed Locator are up, the
    ETR will piggyback the same random number on the next data packet;
    if this is not the case, the ITR can set the Locator as unreachable.
    When traffic flow is unidirectional or when the ETR receiving the
    traffic is not the same as the ITR that transmits it back,
    additional mechanisms are required. The Echo-Nonce mechanism must be
    used in trusted environments only, not over the public
    Internet.[¶](#section-4.2-2.4){.pilcrow}
:   

RLOC-Probing:
:   This is an active probing algorithm where ITRs send probes to
    specific Locators. This effectively probes both the Locator and the
    path. In particular, this is done by sending a Map-Request (with
    certain flags activated) on the data plane (RLOC space) and then
    waiting for a Map-Reply (also sent on the data plane). The active
    nature of RLOC-Probing provides an effective mechanism for
    determining reachability and, in case of failure, switching to a
    different Locator. Furthermore, the mechanism also provides useful
    RTT estimates of the delay of the path that can be used by other
    network algorithms.[¶](#section-4.2-2.6){.pilcrow}
:   

It is worth noting that RLOC-Probing and the Echo-Nonce can work
together. Specifically, if a nonce is not echoed, an ITR cannot
determine which path direction has failed. In this scenario, an ITR can
use RLOC-Probing.[¶](#section-4.2-3){.pilcrow}

Additionally, LISP also recommends inferring the reachability of
Locators by using information provided by the underlay,
particularly:[¶](#section-4.2-4){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

ICMP signaling:
:   The LISP underlay \-- the current Internet \-- uses ICMP to signal
    unreachability (among other things). LISP can take advantage of
    this, and the reception of an ICMP Network Unreachable or ICMP Host
    Unreachable message can be seen as a hint that a Locator might be
    unreachable. This should lead to performing additional
    checks.[¶](#section-4.2-5.2){.pilcrow}
:   

Underlay routing:
:   Both BGP and IGP carry reachability information. LISP-capable
    routers that have access to underlay routing information can use it
    to determine if a given Locator or path is
    reachable.[¶](#section-4.2-5.4){.pilcrow}

### [4.3.](#section-4.3){.section-number .selfRef} [ETR Synchronization](#name-etr-synchronization){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-etr-synchronization}

All the ETRs that are authoritative to a particular EID-Prefix must
announce the same mapping to the requesters. This means that ETRs must
be aware of the status of the RLOCs of the remaining ETRs. This is known
as ETR synchronization.[¶](#section-4.3-1){.pilcrow}

At the time of this writing, LISP does not specify a mechanism to
achieve ETR synchronization. Although many well-known techniques could
be applied to solve this issue, it is still under research. As a result,
operators must rely on coherent manual
configuration.[¶](#section-4.3-2){.pilcrow}

### [4.4.](#section-4.4){.section-number .selfRef} [MTU Handling](#name-mtu-handling){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-mtu-handling}

Since LISP encapsulates packets, it requires dealing with packets that
exceed the MTU of the path between the ITR and the ETR. Specifically,
LISP defines two mechanisms:[¶](#section-4.4-1){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

Stateless:
:   With this mechanism, the effective MTU is assumed from the ITR\'s
    perspective. If a payload packet is too big for the effective MTU
    and can be fragmented, the payload packet is fragmented on the ITR,
    such that reassembly is performed at the destination
    host.[¶](#section-4.4-2.2){.pilcrow}
:   

Stateful:
:   With this mechanism, ITRs keep track of the MTU of the paths towards
    the destination Locators by parsing the ICMP Too Big packets sent by
    intermediate routers. ITRs will send ICMP Too Big messages to inform
    the sources about the effective MTU. Additionally, ITRs can use
    mechanisms such as Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD)
    \[[RFC1191](#RFC1191){.cite .xref}\] or Packetization Layer Path MTU
    Discovery (PLPMTUD) \[[RFC4821](#RFC4821){.cite .xref}\] to keep
    track of the MTU towards the
    Locators.[¶](#section-4.4-2.4){.pilcrow}
:   

In both cases, if the packet cannot be fragmented (IPv4 with DF=1 or
IPv6), then the ITR drops it and replies with an ICMP Too Big message to
the source.[¶](#section-4.4-3){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-5 .section}
## [5.](#section-5){.section-number .selfRef} [Mobility](#name-mobility){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-mobility}

The separation between Locators and identifiers in LISP is suitable for
TE purposes where LISP sites can change their attachment points to the
Internet (i.e., RLOCs) without impacting endpoints or the Internet core.
In this context, the border routers operate the xTR functionality, and
endpoints are not aware of the existence of LISP. This functionality is
similar to Network Mobility \[[RFC3963](#RFC3963){.cite .xref}\].
However, this mode of operation does not allow seamless mobility of
endpoints between different LISP sites, as the EID address might not be
routable in a visited site. Nevertheless, LISP can be used to enable
seamless IP mobility when LISP is directly implemented in the endpoint
or when the endpoint roams to an attached xTR. Each endpoint is then an
xTR, and the EID address is the one presented to the network stack used
by applications while the RLOC is the address gathered from the network
when it is visited. This functionality is similar to Mobile IP
(\[[RFC5944](#RFC5944){.cite .xref}\] and \[[RFC6275](#RFC6275){.cite
.xref}\]).[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

Whenever a device changes its RLOC, the xTR updates the RLOC of its
local mapping and registers it to its Map-Server, typically with a low
TTL value (1 min). To avoid the need for a home gateway, the ITR also
indicates the RLOC change to all remote devices that have ongoing
communications with the device that moved. The combination of both
methods ensures the scalability of the system, as signaling is strictly
limited to the Map-Server and to hosts with which communications are
ongoing. In the mobility case, the EID-Prefix can be as small as a full
/32 or /128 (IPv4 or IPv6, respectively), depending on the specific use
case (e.g., subnet mobility vs. single VM/Mobile node
mobility).[¶](#section-5-2){.pilcrow}

The decoupled identity and location provided by LISP allow it to operate
with other Layer 2 and Layer 3 mobility
solutions.[¶](#section-5-3){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-6 .section}
## [6.](#section-6){.section-number .selfRef} [Multicast](#name-multicast){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-multicast}

LISP also supports transporting IP multicast packets sent from the EID
space. The required operational changes to the multicast protocols are
documented in \[[RFC6831](#RFC6831){.cite
.xref}\].[¶](#section-6-1){.pilcrow}

In such scenarios, LISP may create multicast state both at the core and
at the sites (both source and receiver). When signaling is used to
create multicast state at the sites, LISP routers encapsulate PIM
Join/Prune messages from receiver to source sites as unicast packets. At
the core, ETRs build a new PIM Join/Prune message addressed to the RLOC
of the ITR servicing the source. A simplified sequence is shown
below.[¶](#section-6-2){.pilcrow}

1.  [An end host willing to join a multicast channel sends an IGMP
    report. Multicast PIM routers at the LISP site propagate PIM
    Join/Prune messages (S-EID, G) towards the
    ETR.[¶](#section-6-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-6-3.1}
2.  [The Join message flows to the ETR. Upon reception, the ETR builds
    two Join messages. The first one unicast LISP-encapsulates the
    original Join message towards the RLOC of the ITR servicing the
    source. This message creates (S-EID, G) multicast state at the
    source site. The second Join message contains, as a destination
    address, the RLOC of the ITR servicing the source (S-RLOC, G) and
    creates multicast state at the
    core.[¶](#section-6-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-6-3.2}
3.  [Multicast data packets originated by the source (S-EID, G) flow
    from the source to the ITR. The ITR LISP-encapsulates the multicast
    packets. The outer header includes its own RLOC as the source
    (S-RLOC) and the original multicast group address (G) as the
    destination. Please note that multicast group addresses are logical
    and are not resolved by the Mapping System. Then, the multicast
    packets are transmitted through the core towards the receiving ETRs,
    which decapsulate the packets and forward them using the receiver
    site\'s multicast
    state.[¶](#section-6-3.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-6-3.3}

Please note that the inner and outer multicast addresses are generally
different, except in specific cases where the underlay provider
implements tight control on the overlay. LISP specifications already
support all PIM modes \[[RFC6831](#RFC6831){.cite .xref}\].
Additionally, LISP can also support non-PIM mechanisms in order to
maintain multicast state.[¶](#section-6-4){.pilcrow}

When multicast sources and receivers are active at LISP sites and the
core network between the sites does not provide multicast support, a
signal-free mechanism can be used to create an overlay that will allow
multicast traffic to flow between sites and connect the multicast trees
at the different sites \[[RFC8378](#RFC8378){.cite .xref}\].
Registrations from the different receiver sites will be merged in the
Mapping System to assemble a multicast replication list inclusive of all
RLOCs that lead to receivers for a particular multicast group or
multicast channel. The replication list for each specific multicast
entry is maintained as a database mapping entry in the LISP Mapping
System.[¶](#section-6-5){.pilcrow}

A LISP site can strictly impose via which ETRs the traffic must enter
the LISP site network even though the path followed to reach the ETR is
not under the control of the LISP site. This fine control is implemented
with the mappings. When a remote site is willing to send traffic to a
LISP site, it retrieves the mapping associated with the destination EID
via the Mapping System. The mapping is sent directly by an authoritative
ETR of the EID and is not altered by any intermediate
network.[¶](#section-7.1-1){.pilcrow}

A mapping associates a list of RLOCs with an EID-Prefix. Each RLOC
corresponds to an interface of an ETR (or set of ETRs) that is able to
correctly forward packets to EIDs in the prefix. Each RLOC is tagged
with a priority and a weight in the mapping. The priority is used to
indicate which RLOCs should be preferred for sending packets (the least
preferred ones being provided for backup purposes). The weight permits
balancing the load between the RLOCs with the same priority, in
proportion to the weight value.[¶](#section-7.1-2){.pilcrow}

As mappings are directly issued by the authoritative ETR of the EID and
are not altered when transmitted to the remote site, it offers highly
flexible incoming inter-domain TE and even makes it possible for a site
to support a different mapping policy for each remote
site.[¶](#section-7.1-3){.pilcrow}

LISP encapsulations allow transporting packets using EIDs from a given
address family (e.g., IPv6) with packets from other address families
(e.g., IPv4). The absence of correlation between the address families of
RLOCs and EIDs makes LISP a candidate to allow, e.g., IPv6 to be
deployed when all of the core network may not have IPv6
enabled.[¶](#section-7.2-1){.pilcrow}

For example, two IPv6-only data centers could be interconnected via the
legacy IPv4 Internet. If their border routers are LISP capable, sending
packets between the data centers is done without any form of
translation, as the original IPv6 packets (in the EID space) will be
LISP encapsulated and transmitted over the IPv4 legacy Internet via IPv4
RLOCs.[¶](#section-7.2-2){.pilcrow}

It is common to operate several virtual networks over the same physical
infrastructure. In such virtual private networks, determining to which
virtual network a packet belongs is essential; tags or labels are used
for that purpose. When using LISP, the distinction can be made with the
\'Instance ID\' field. When an ITR encapsulates a packet from a
particular virtual network (e.g., known via Virtual Routing and
Forwarding (VRF) or the VLAN), it tags the encapsulated packet with the
Instance ID corresponding to the virtual network of the packet. When an
ETR receives a packet tagged with an Instance ID, it uses the Instance
ID to determine how to treat the packet.[¶](#section-7.3-1){.pilcrow}

A way to enable seamless virtual machine (VM) mobility in the data
center is to conceive the data center backbone as the RLOC space and the
subnet where servers are hosted as forming the EID space. A LISP router
is placed at the border between the backbone and each subnet. When a VM
is moved to another subnet, it can keep (temporarily) the address it had
before the move so as to continue without a transport-layer connection
reset. When an xTR detects a source address received on a subnet to be
an address not assigned to the subnet, it registers the address to the
Mapping System.[¶](#section-7.4-1){.pilcrow}

## [8.](#section-8){.section-number .selfRef} [Security Considerations](#name-security-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-security-considerations}

This section describes the security considerations associated with
LISP.[¶](#section-8-1){.pilcrow}

In a push Mapping System, the state necessary to forward packets is
learned independently of the traffic itself. However, with a pull
architecture, the system becomes reactive, and data plane events (e.g.,
the arrival of a packet with an unknown destination address) may trigger
control plane events. This on-demand learning of mappings provides many
advantages, as discussed above, but may also affect the way security is
enforced.[¶](#section-8-2){.pilcrow}

Usually, the data plane is implemented in the fast path of routers to
provide high-performance forwarding capabilities, while the control
plane features are implemented in the slow path to offer high
flexibility, and a performance gap of several orders of magnitude can be
observed between the slow and fast paths. As a consequence, the way to
notify the control plane of data plane events must be considered
carefully so as not to overload the slow path, and rate limiting should
be used as specified in \[[RFC9300](#RFC9300){.cite .xref}\] and
\[[RFC9301](#RFC9301){.cite .xref}\].[¶](#section-8-3){.pilcrow}

Care must also be taken not to overload the Mapping System (i.e., the
control plane infrastructure), as the operations to be performed by the
Mapping System may be more complex than those on the data plane. For
that reason, \[[RFC9300](#RFC9300){.cite .xref}\] and
\[[RFC9301](#RFC9301){.cite .xref}\] recommend rate limiting the sending
of messages to the Mapping System.[¶](#section-8-4){.pilcrow}

To improve resiliency and reduce the overall number of messages
exchanged, LISP makes it possible to leak certain information, such as
the reachability of Locators, directly into data plane packets. In
environments that are not fully trusted, like the open Internet, control
information gleaned from data plane packets must not be used or must be
verified before using it.[¶](#section-8-5){.pilcrow}

Mappings are the centerpiece of LISP, and all precautions must be taken
to prevent malicious entities from manipulating or misusing them. Using
trustable Map-Servers that strictly respect \[[RFC9301](#RFC9301){.cite
.xref}\] and the authentication mechanism proposed by LISP-SEC
\[[RFC9303](#RFC9303){.cite .xref}\] reduces the risk of attacks on
mapping integrity. In more critical environments, secure measures may be
needed. The way security is implemented for a given Mapping System
strongly depends on the architecture of the Mapping System itself and
the threat model assumed for the deployment. Thus, Mapping System
security has to be discussed in the relevant documents proposing the
Mapping System architecture.[¶](#section-8-6){.pilcrow}

As with any other tunneling mechanism, middleboxes on the path between
an ITR (or PITR) and an ETR (or PETR) must implement mechanisms to strip
the LISP encapsulation to correctly inspect the content of
LISP-encapsulated packets.[¶](#section-8-7){.pilcrow}

Like other map-and-encap mechanisms, LISP enables triangular routing
(i.e., packets of a flow cross different border routers, depending on
their direction). This means that intermediate boxes may have an
incomplete view of the traffic they inspect or manipulate. Moreover,
LISP-encapsulated packets are routed based on the outer IP address
(i.e., the RLOC) and can be delivered to an ETR that is not responsible
for the destination EID of the packet or even delivered to a network
element that is not an ETR. Mitigation consists of applying appropriate
filtering techniques on the network elements that can potentially
receive unexpected LISP-encapsulated packets.[¶](#section-8-8){.pilcrow}

## [Appendix A.](#appendix-A){.section-number .selfRef} [A Brief History of Location/Identity Separation](#name-a-brief-history-of-location){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-a-brief-history-of-location}

The LISP architecture for separation of location and identity resulted
from the discussions of this topic at the Amsterdam IAB Routing and
Addressing Workshop, which took place in October 2006
\[[RFC4984](#RFC4984){.cite .xref}\].[¶](#appendix-A-1){.pilcrow}

A small group of like-minded personnel spontaneously formed immediately
after that workshop to work on an idea that came out of informal
discussions at the workshop and on various mailing lists. The first
Internet-Draft on LISP appeared in January
2007.[¶](#appendix-A-2){.pilcrow}

Trial implementations started at that time, with initial trial
deployments underway since June 2007; the results of early experience
have been fed back into the design in a continuous, ongoing process over
several years. At this point, LISP represents a moderately mature
system, having undergone a long, organic series of changes and
updates.[¶](#appendix-A-3){.pilcrow}

LISP transitioned from an IRTF activity to an IETF WG in March 2009.
After numerous revisions, the basic specifications moved to becoming
RFCs at the start of 2013; work to expand, improve, and find new uses
for it continues (and undoubtedly will for a long time to come). The
LISP WG was rechartered in 2018 to continue work on the LISP base
protocol and produce Standards Track
documents.[¶](#appendix-A-4){.pilcrow}

### [A.1.](#appendix-A.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Old LISP Models](#name-old-lisp-models){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-old-lisp-models}

LISP, as initially conceived, had a number of potential operating modes,
named \'models\'. Although they are not used anymore, one occasionally
sees mention of them, so they are briefly described
here.[¶](#appendix-A.1-1){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

LISP 1:
:   EIDs all appear in the normal routing and forwarding tables of the
    network (i.e., they are \'routable\'). This property is used to load
    EID-to-RLOC mappings via bootstrapping operations. Packets are sent
    with the EID as the destination in the outer wrapper; when an ETR
    sees such a packet, it sends a Map-Reply to the source ITR, giving
    the full mapping.[¶](#appendix-A.1-2.2){.pilcrow}
:   

LISP 1.5:
:   LISP 1.5 is similar to LISP 1, but the routability of EIDs happens
    on a separate network.[¶](#appendix-A.1-2.4){.pilcrow}
:   

LISP 2:
:   EIDs are not routable; EID-to-RLOC mappings are available from the
    DNS.[¶](#appendix-A.1-2.6){.pilcrow}
:   

LISP 3:
:   EIDs are not routable and have to be looked up in a new EID-to-RLOC
    mapping database (in the initial concept, a system using Distributed
    Hash Tables). Two variants were possible: a \'push\' system in which
    all mappings were distributed to all ITRs and a \'pull\' system in
    which ITRs load the mappings when they need
    them.[¶](#appendix-A.1-2.8){.pilcrow}
