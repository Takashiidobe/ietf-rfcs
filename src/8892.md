# RFC 8892 {#rfcnum}

# Guidelines and Registration Procedures for Interface Types and Tunnel Types {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

This document provides guidelines and procedures for those who are
defining, registering, or evaluating definitions of new interface types
(\"ifType\" values) and tunnel types. The original definition of the
IANA interface type registry predated the use of IANA Considerations
sections and YANG modules, so some confusion arose over time. Tunnel
types were added later, with the same requirements and allocation policy
as interface types. This document updates RFC 2863 and provides updated
guidance for these registries.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

The IANA IfType-MIB, which contains the list of interface type (ifType)
values, was originally defined in \[[RFC1573](#RFC1573){.xref}\] as a
separate MIB module together with the Interfaces Group MIB (IF-MIB)
module. The IF-MIB module was subsequently updated and is currently
specified in \[[RFC2863](#RFC2863){.xref}\], but the latest IF-MIB RFC
no longer contains the IANA IfType-MIB. Instead, the IANA IfType-MIB is
maintained by IANA as a separate module. Similarly,
\[[RFC7224](#RFC7224){.xref}\] created an initial IANA Interface Type
YANG Module, and the current version is maintained by
IANA.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

The current IANA IfType registry is at
\[[ifType-registry](#ifType-registry){.xref}\], with the same values
also appearing in both \[[yang-if-type](#yang-if-type){.xref}\] and the
IANAifType textual convention at
\[[IANAifType-MIB](#IANAifType-MIB){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

Although the ifType registry was originally defined in a MIB module, the
assignment and use of interface type values are not tied to MIB modules
or any other management mechanism. An interface type value can be used
as the value of a data model object (MIB object, YANG object, etc.), as
part of a unique identifier of a data model for a given interface type
(e.g., in an OID), or simply as a value exposed by local APIs or UIs on
a device.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

The TUNNEL-MIB was defined in \[[RFC2667](#RFC2667){.xref}\] (now
obsoleted by \[[RFC4087](#RFC4087){.xref}\]), which created a tunnelType
registry (\[[tunnelType-registry](#tunnelType-registry){.xref}\] and the
IANAtunnelType textual convention at
\[[IANAifType-MIB](#IANAifType-MIB){.xref}\]), and it defined the
assignment policy for tunnelType values to always be identical to the
policy for assigning ifType values.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

This document addresses the following issues:[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

1.  [As noted in [Section 1](#intro){.xref}, the original guidance was
    written with wording specific to MIB modules; accordingly, some
    confusion has resulted when using YANG modules. This document
    clarifies that ifTypes and tunnelTypes are independent from the type
    of, or even existence of, a data
    model.[¶](#section-3-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-2.1}
2.  [The use of and requirements around sub-layers and sub-types were
    not well understood, but good examples of both now exist. This is
    discussed in [Section
    4](#sublayers){.xref}.[¶](#section-3-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-2.2}
3.  [Since the \"Interface Types (ifType)\" and \"Tunnel Types
    (tunnelType)\" registries were originally defined, and are still
    retrievable, in the format of MIB modules (in addition to other
    formats), confusion arose when adding YANG modules as another format
    as to whether each is a separate registry. This is discussed in
    [Section
    5](#formats){.xref}.[¶](#section-3-2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-2.3}
4.  [The registries are retrievable in the format of MIB and YANG
    modules, but there was previously no process guidance written to
    check that those formats were syntactically correct as updates were
    made, which led to the registry having syntax errors that broke
    tools. [Section 6.1](#procedures){.xref} adds a validation step to
    the documented assignment
    procedure.[¶](#section-3-2.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-2.4}
5.  [Various documents and registries previously said to submit requests
    via email, but a web form exists for submitting requests, which
    caused some confusion around which was to be used. This is addressed
    in [Section
    6.1](#procedures){.xref}.[¶](#section-3-2.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-2.5}
6.  [Transmission values
    \[[transmission-registry](#transmission-registry){.xref}\] have
    generally been allocated as part of ifType allocation, but no
    guidance existed as to whether a requester must ask for it or not,
    and the request form had no such required field. As a result, IANA
    has asked the designated expert to decide for each allocation, but
    no relevant guidance for the designated expert has been documented.
    This is remedied in [Section
    6.2](#transmission-discussion){.xref}.[¶](#section-3-2.6){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-2.6}

## [4.](#section-4){.section-number .selfRef} [Interface Sub-layers and Sub-types](#name-interface-sub-layers-and-su){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-interface-sub-layers-and-su}

When multiple sub-layers exist below the network layer, each sub-layer
can be represented by its own row in the ifTable with its own ifType,
with the ifStackTable being used to identify the upward and downward
multiplexing relationships between rows. [Section
3.1.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2863#section-3.1.1){.relref} of
\[[RFC2863](#RFC2863){.xref}\] provides more discussion, and
[3.1.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2863#section-3.1.2){.relref}
provides guidance for defining interface sub-layers. More recent
experience shows that those guidelines were phrased in a way that is now
too restrictive, since at the time \[[RFC2863](#RFC2863){.xref}\] was
written, MIB modules were the dominant data
model.[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

This document clarifies that the same guidance also applies to YANG
modules.[¶](#section-4-2){.pilcrow}

Some ifTypes may define sub-types. For example, the tunnel(131) ifType
defines sub-types known as \"tunnelTypes\", where each tunnelType can
have its own MIB and/or YANG module with protocol-specific information,
but there is enough in common that some information is exposed in a
generic IP Tunnel MIB corresponding to the tunnel(131)
ifType.[¶](#section-4-3){.pilcrow}

For requests that involve multiple sub-layers below the network layer,
requests [MUST]{.bcp14} include (or reference) a discussion of the
multiplexing relationships between sub-layers, ideally with a diagram.
Various well-written examples exist of such definitions, including
[Section
3.4.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3637#section-3.4.1){.relref} of
\[[RFC3637](#RFC3637){.xref}\], [Section
3.1.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4087#section-3.1.1){.relref} of
\[[RFC4087](#RFC4087){.xref}\], and [Section
3.1.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5066#section-3.1.1){.relref} of
\[[RFC5066](#RFC5066){.xref}\].[¶](#section-4-4){.pilcrow}

Definers of sub-layers and sub-types should consider which model is more
appropriate for their needs. A sub-layer is generally used whenever
either a dynamic relationship exists (i.e., when the set of instances
above or below a given instance can change over time) or a multiplexing
relationship exists with another sub-layer. A sub-type can be used when
neither of these is true but where one interface type is conceptually a
subclass of another interface type, as far as a management data model is
concerned.[¶](#section-4-5){.pilcrow}

In general, the intent of an interface type or sub-type is that its
definition should be sufficient to identify an interoperable protocol.
In some cases, however, a protocol might be defined in a way that is not
sufficient to provide interoperability with other compliant
implementations of that protocol. In such a case, an ifType definition
should discuss whether specific instantiations (or profiles) of behavior
should use a sub-layer model (e.g., each vendor might layer the protocol
over its own sub-layer that provides the missing details) or a sub-type
model (i.e., each vendor might subclass the protocol without any
layering relationship). If a sub-type model is more appropriate, then
the data model for the protocol might include a sub-type identifier so
that management software can discover objects specific to the sub-type.
In either case, such discussion is important to guide definers of a data
model for the more specific information (i.e., a lower sub-layer or a
sub-type), as well as the designated expert, who must review requests
for any such ifTypes or sub-types.[¶](#section-4-6){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-4.1 .section}
### [4.1.](#section-4.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Alternate Values](#name-alternate-values){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-alternate-values}

Another design decision is whether to reuse an existing ifType or
tunnelType value, possibly using a sub-type or sub-layer model for
refinements, or to use a different value for a new
mechanism.[¶](#section-4.1-1){.pilcrow}

If there is already an entry that could easily satisfy the modeling and
functional requirements for the requested entry, it should be reused so
that applications and tools that use the existing value can be used
without changes. If, however, the modeling and functional requirements
are significantly different enough such that having existing
applications and tools use the existing value would be seen as a
problem, a new value should be used.[¶](#section-4.1-2){.pilcrow}

For example, originally different ifType values were used for different
flavors of Ethernet (ethernetCsmacd(6), iso88023Csmacd(7),
fastEther(62), etc.), typically because they were registered by
different vendors. Using different values was, however, seen as
problematic because all were functionally similar, so
\[[RFC3635](#RFC3635){.xref}\] then deprecated all but
ethernetCsmacd(6).[¶](#section-4.1-3){.pilcrow}

As another example, a udp(8) tunnelType value was defined in
\[[RFC2667](#RFC2667){.xref}\] with the description \"The value UDP
indicates that the payload packet is encapsulated within a normal UDP
packet (e.g., RFC 1234).\" The Teredo tunnel protocol
\[[RFC4380](#RFC4380){.xref}\] was later defined and encapsulates
packets over UDP, but the protocol model is quite different between
\[[RFC1234](#RFC1234){.xref}\] and Teredo. For example,
\[[RFC1234](#RFC1234){.xref}\] supports encapsulation of
multicast/broadcast traffic, whereas Teredo does not. As such, it would
be more confusing to applications and tools to represent them using the
same tunnel type, and so \[[RFC4087](#RFC4087){.xref}\] defined a new
value for Teredo.[¶](#section-4.1-4){.pilcrow}

In summary, definers of new interface or tunnel mechanisms should use a
new ifType or tunnelType value rather than reuse an existing value when
key aspects such as the header format or the link model (point-to-point,
non-broadcast multi-access, broadcast-capable multi-access,
unidirectional broadcast, etc.) are significantly different from
existing values, but they should reuse the same value when the
differences can be expressed in terms of differing values of existing
objects other than ifType/tunnelType in the standard YANG or MIB
module.[¶](#section-4.1-5){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-5 .section}
## [5.](#section-5){.section-number .selfRef} [Available Formats](#name-available-formats){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-available-formats}

Many registries are available in multiple formats. For example, XML,
HTML, CSV, and plain text are common formats in which many registries
are available. This document clarifies that the
\[[IANAifType-MIB](#IANAifType-MIB){.xref}\],
\[[yang-if-type](#yang-if-type){.xref}\], and
\[[yang-tunnel-type](#yang-tunnel-type){.xref}\] MIB and YANG modules
are merely additional formats in which the \"Interface Types (ifType)\"
and \"Tunnel Types (tunnelType)\" registries are available. The MIB and
YANG modules are not separate registries, and the same values are always
present in all formats of the same registry.[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

The confusion stemmed in part from the fact that the IANA \"Protocol
Registries\" \[[protocol-registries](#protocol-registries){.xref}\]
listed the YANG and MIB module formats separately, as if they were
separate registries. However, the entries for the yang-if-type and
iana-tunnel-type YANG modules said \"See ifType definitions registry\"
and \"See tunnelType registry
(mib-2.interface.ifTable.ifEntry.ifType.tunnelType)\" respectively,
although the entry for the IANAifType-MIB had no such note. [Section
7.1](#module-formats){.xref} addresses this.[¶](#section-5-2){.pilcrow}

The IANA policy (using terms defined in \[[RFC8126](#RFC8126){.xref}\])
for registration is Expert Review for both interface types and tunnel
types. The role of the designated expert in the procedure is to raise
possible concerns about wider implications of proposals for use and
deployment of interface types. While it is recommended that the
responsible Area Director and the IESG take into consideration the
designated expert opinions, nothing in the procedure empowers the
designated expert to override properly arrived-at IETF or working group
consensus.[¶](#section-6-1){.pilcrow}

Someone wishing to register a new ifType or tunnelType value
[MUST]{.bcp14}:[¶](#section-6.1-1){.pilcrow}

1.  [Check the IANA registry to see whether there is already an entry
    that could easily satisfy the modeling and functional requirements
    for the requested entry. If there is already such an entry, use it
    or update the existing specification. Text in an Internet-Draft or
    part of some permanently available, stable specification may be
    written to clarify the usage of an existing entry or entries for the
    desired purpose.[¶](#section-6.1-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.1-2.1}
2.  [Check the IANA registry to see whether there is already some other
    entry with the desired name. If there is already an unrelated entry
    under the desired name, choose a different
    name.[¶](#section-6.1-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.1-2.2}
3.  [Prepare a registration request using the template specified in
    [Section 6.3](#template){.xref}. The registration request can be
    contained in an Internet-Draft, submitted alone, or submitted as
    part of some permanently available, stable specification. The
    registration request can also be submitted in some other form (as
    part of another document or as a stand-alone document), but the
    registration request will be treated as an \"IETF Contribution\"
    under the guidelines of
    \[[RFC5378](#RFC5378){.xref}\].[¶](#section-6.1-2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.1-2.3}
4.  [Submit the registration request (or pointer to a document
    containing it) to IANA at iana\@iana.org or (if requesting an
    ifType) via the web form at
    \<<https://www.iana.org/form/iftype>\>.[¶](#section-6.1-2.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.1-2.4}

Upon receipt of a registration request, the following steps
[MUST]{.bcp14} be followed:[¶](#section-6.1-3){.pilcrow}

1.  [IANA checks the submission for completeness; if required
    information is missing or any citations are not correct, IANA will
    reject the registration request. A registrant can resubmit a
    corrected request if
    desired.[¶](#section-6.1-4.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.1-4.1}
2.  [IANA requests Expert Review of the registration request against the
    corresponding guidelines from this
    document.[¶](#section-6.1-4.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.1-4.2}
3.  [The designated expert will evaluate the request against the
    criteria.[¶](#section-6.1-4.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.1-4.3}
4.  [Once the designated expert approves a registration, IANA updates
    \[[ifType-registry](#ifType-registry){.xref}\],
    \[[IANAifType-MIB](#IANAifType-MIB){.xref}\], and
    \[[yang-if-type](#yang-if-type){.xref}\] to show the registration
    for an interface type, or
    \[[tunnelType-registry](#tunnelType-registry){.xref}\],
    \[[IANAifType-MIB](#IANAifType-MIB){.xref}\], and
    \[[yang-tunnel-type](#yang-tunnel-type){.xref}\] to show the
    registration for a tunnel type. When adding values, IANA should

notes:[¶](#section-6.2-1){.pilcrow}

> The relationship between the assignment of ifType values and of OIDs
> to particular media-specific MIBs is solely the purview of IANA and is
> subject to change without notice. Quite often, a media-specific MIB\'s
> OID-subtree assignment within MIB-II\'s \'transmission\' subtree will
> be the same as its ifType value. However, in some circumstances this
> will not be the case, and implementors must not pre-assume any
> specific relationship between ifType values and transmission subtree
> OIDs.[¶](#section-6.2-2){.pilcrow}

The advice above remains unchanged, but this document changes the
allocation procedure to streamline the process, so that an ifType value
and a transmission number value with the same value will be assigned at
the same time.[¶](#section-6.2-3){.pilcrow}

Rationale:[¶](#section-6.2-4){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

\(1\)
:   This saves future effort if a transmission number is later deemed
    necessary, since no IANA request is needed that would then require
    another Expert Review.[¶](#section-6.2-5.1){.pilcrow}
:   

\(2\)
:   The transmission numbering space is not scarce, so there seems to be
    little need to reserve the number for a different purpose than what
    the ifType is for.[¶](#section-6.2-5.2){.pilcrow}
:   

\(3\)
:   The designated expert need not review whether a transmission number
    value should be registered when processing each ifType request, thus
    reducing the possibility of delaying assignment of ifType
    values.[¶](#section-6.2-5.3){.pilcrow}
:   

\(4\)
:   There is no case on record where allocating the same value could
    have caused any problems.[¶](#section-6.2-5.4){.pilcrow}

This entire document is about IANA considerations, but this section
discusses actions taken by and to be taken by IANA. There are three
registries affected:[¶](#section-7-1){.pilcrow}

1.  [Interface Types (ifType)
    \[[ifType-registry](#ifType-registry){.xref}\]: The registration
    process is updated in [Section 6.1](#procedures){.xref}, and the

2.  [Tunnel Types (tunnelType)
    \[[tunnelType-registry](#tunnelType-registry){.xref}\]: The
    registration process is updated in [Section

At the time of publication of this document, IANA is unable to perform
some of the actions requested below due to limitations of their current
platform and toolset. In such cases, IANA is requested to perform these
actions as and when the migration to a new platform that would enable
these actions is complete.[¶](#section-7-3){.pilcrow}
