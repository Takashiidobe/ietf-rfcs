This memo describes common vulnerabilities related to Domain Name System
(DNS) resource record (RR) processing as seen in several DNS client
implementations. These vulnerabilities may lead to successful
Denial-of-Service and Remote Code Execution attacks against the affected
software. Where applicable, violations of RFC 1035 are
mentioned.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

Major vulnerabilities in DNS implementations recently became evident and
raised attention to this protocol as an important attack vector, as
discussed in \[[SIGRED](#SIGRED){.xref}\], \[[SADDNS](#SADDNS){.xref}\],
and \[[DNSPOOQ](#DNSPOOQ){.xref}\], the latter being a set of 7 critical
issues affecting the DNS forwarder
\"dnsmasq\".[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

The authors of this memo have analyzed the DNS client implementations of
several major TCP/IP protocol stacks and found a set of vulnerabilities
that share common implementation flaws (anti-patterns). These flaws are
related to processing DNS resource records (RRs) (discussed in
\[[RFC1035](#RFC1035){.xref}\]) and may lead to critical security
vulnerabilities.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

While implementation flaws may differ from one software project to
another, these anti-patterns are highly likely to span multiple
implementations. In fact, one of the first \"Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures\" (CVE) documents related to one of the anti-patterns
\[[CVE-2000-0333](#CVE-2000-0333){.xref}\] dates back to the year 2000.
The observations are not limited to DNS client implementations. Any
software that processes DNS RRs may be affected, such as firewalls,
intrusion detection systems, or general-purpose DNS packet dissectors
(e.g., the DNS dissector in Wireshark; see
\[[CVE-2017-9345](#CVE-2017-9345){.xref}\]). Similar issues may also
occur in DNS-over-HTTPS \[[RFC8484](#RFC8484){.xref}\] and DNS-over-TLS
\[[RFC7858](#RFC7858){.xref}\] implementations. However, any
implementation that deals with the DNS wire format is subject to the
considerations discussed in this document.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

\[[DNS-COMPRESSION](#I-D.ietf-dnsind-local-compression){.xref}\] and
\[[RFC5625](#RFC5625){.xref}\] briefly mention some of these
anti-patterns, but the main purpose of this memo is to provide technical
details behind these anti-patterns, so that the common mistakes can be
eradicated.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

We provide general recommendations on mitigating the anti-patterns. We
also suggest that all implementations should drop malicious/malformed
DNS replies and (optionally) log them.[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}

## [2.](#section-2){.section-number .selfRef} [Compression Pointer and Offset Validation](#name-compression-pointer-and-off){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-compression-pointer-and-off}

\[[RFC1035](#RFC1035){.xref}\] defines the DNS message compression
scheme that can be used to reduce the size of messages. When it is used,
an entire domain name or several name labels are replaced with a
(compression) pointer to a prior occurrence of the same
name.[¶](#section-2-1){.pilcrow}

The compression pointer is a combination of two octets: the two most
significant bits are set to 1, and the remaining 14 bits are the OFFSET
field. This field specifies the offset from the beginning of the DNS
header, at which another domain name or label is
located:[¶](#section-2-2){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-2-3 .alignLeft .art-text .artwork}
    +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
    | 1  1|                OFFSET                   |
    +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+

[¶](#section-2-3){.pilcrow}
:::

The message compression scheme explicitly allows a domain name to be
represented as one of the following: (1) a sequence of unpacked labels
ending with a zero octet, (2) a pointer, or (3) a sequence of labels
ending with a pointer.[¶](#section-2-4){.pilcrow}

However, \[[RFC1035](#RFC1035){.xref}\] does not explicitly state that
blindly following compression pointers of any kind can be harmful
\[[DNS-COMPRESSION](#I-D.ietf-dnsind-local-compression){.xref}\], as we
could not have had any assumptions about various implementations that
would follow.[¶](#section-2-5){.pilcrow}

Yet, any DNS packet parser that attempts to decompress domain names
without validating the value of OFFSET is likely susceptible to memory
corruption bugs and buffer overruns. These bugs make it easier to
perform Denial-of-Service attacks and may result in successful Remote
Code Execution attacks.[¶](#section-2-6){.pilcrow}

Pseudocode that illustrates a typical example of a broken domain name
parsing implementation is shown below ([Figure
1](#snippet_1){.xref}):[¶](#section-2-7){.pilcrow}

[Figure 1](#figure-1){.selfRef}: [A Broken Implementation of a Function
That Is Used for Decompressing DNS Domain Names
(Pseudocode)](#name-a-broken-implementation-of-){.selfRef}
:::

Such implementations typically have a dedicated function for
decompressing domain names (for example, see
\[[CVE-2020-24338](#CVE-2020-24338){.xref}\] and
\[[CVE-2020-27738](#CVE-2020-27738){.xref}\]). Among other parameters,
these functions may accept a pointer to the beginning of the first name
label within an RR (\"name\") and a pointer to the beginning of the DNS
payload to be used as a starting point for the compression pointer
(\"dns_payload\"). The destination buffer for the domain name
(\"name_buffer\") is typically limited to 255 bytes as per
\[[RFC1035](#RFC1035){.xref}\] and can be allocated either in the stack
or in the heap memory region.[¶](#section-2-9){.pilcrow}

The code of the function in [Figure 1](#snippet_1){.xref} reads the
domain name label by label from an RR until it reaches the NUL octet
(\"0x00\") that signifies the end of a domain name. If the current label
length octet (\"label_len_octet\") is a compression pointer, the code
extracts the value of the compression offset and uses it to \"jump\" to
another label length octet. If the current label length octet is not a
compression pointer, the label bytes will be copied into the name
buffer, and the number of bytes copied will correspond to the value of
the current label length octet. After the copy operation, the code will
move on to the next label length octet.[¶](#section-2-10){.pilcrow}

The first issue with this implementation is due to unchecked compression
offset values. The second issue is due to the absence of checks that
ensure that a pointer will eventually arrive at a decompressed domain
label. We describe these issues in more detail
below.[¶](#section-2-11){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC1035](#RFC1035){.xref}\] states that a compression pointer is \"a
pointer to a prior occurance \[sic\] of the same name.\" Also, according
to \[[RFC1035](#RFC1035){.xref}\], the maximum size of DNS packets that
can be sent over UDP is limited to 512
octets.[¶](#section-2-12){.pilcrow}

The pseudocode in [Figure 1](#snippet_1){.xref} violates these
constraints, as it will accept a compression pointer that forces the
code to read outside the bounds of a DNS packet. For instance, a
compression pointer set to \"0xffff\" will produce an offset of 16383
octets, which is most definitely pointing to a label length octet
somewhere past the bounds of the original DNS packet. Supplying such
offset values will most likely cause memory corruption issues and may
lead to Denial-of-Service conditions (e.g., a Null pointer dereference
after \"label_len_octet\" is set to an invalid address in memory). For
additional examples, see \[[CVE-2020-25767](#CVE-2020-25767){.xref}\],
\[[CVE-2020-24339](#CVE-2020-24339){.xref}\], and
\[[CVE-2020-24335](#CVE-2020-24335){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2-13){.pilcrow}

The pseudocode in [Figure 1](#snippet_1){.xref} allows jumping from a
compression pointer to another compression pointer and does not restrict
the number of such jumps. That is, if a label length octet that is
currently being parsed is a compression pointer, the code will perform a
jump to another label, and if that other label is a compression pointer
as well, the code will perform another jump, and so forth until it
reaches a decompressed label. This may lead to unforeseen side effects
that result in security issues.[¶](#section-2-14){.pilcrow}

Consider the DNS packet excerpt illustrated
below:[¶](#section-2-15){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-2-16 .alignLeft .art-text .artwork}

    |               |
    -----------------

[¶](#section-2-16){.pilcrow}
:::

The packet begins with a DNS header at offset +0x00, and its DNS payload
contains several RRs. The first RR begins at an offset of 12 octets
(+0x0c); its first label length octet is set to the value \"0xc0\",
which indicates that it is a compression pointer. The compression
pointer offset is computed from the two octets \"0xc00c\" and is equal
to 12. Since the broken implementation in [Figure 1](#snippet_1){.xref}
follows this offset value blindly, the pointer will jump back to the
first octet of the first RR (+0x0c) over and over again. The code in
[Figure 1](#snippet_1){.xref} will enter an infinite-loop state, since
it will never leave the \"TRUE\" branch of the \"while\"
loop.[¶](#section-2-17){.pilcrow}

Apart from achieving infinite loops, the implementation flaws in [Figure
1](#snippet_1){.xref} make it possible to achieve various pointer loops
that have other undesirable effects. For instance, consider the DNS
packet excerpt shown below:[¶](#section-2-18){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-2-19 .alignLeft .art-text .artwork}
            +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+

    |       +----+----+----+----+----+----+--|-+----+----+----+----+----+
    |                                        |
    ------------------------------------------

[¶](#section-2-19){.pilcrow}
:::

With such a domain name, the implementation in [Figure
1](#snippet_1){.xref} will first copy the domain label at offset
\"0xc0\" (\"test\"); it will then fetch the next label length octet,
which happens to be a compression pointer (\"0xc0\"). The compression
pointer offset is computed from the two octets \"0xc00c\" and is equal
to 12 octets. The code will jump back to offset \"0xc0\" where the first
label \"test\" is located. The code will again copy the \"test\" label
and then jump back to it, following the compression pointer, over and
over again.[¶](#section-2-20){.pilcrow}

[Figure 1](#snippet_1){.xref} does not contain any logic that restricts
multiple jumps from the same compression pointer and does not ensure
that no more than 255 octets are copied into the name buffer
(\"name_buffer\"). In fact,[¶](#section-2-21){.pilcrow}

-   [the code will continue to write the label \"test\" into it,
    overwriting the name buffer and the stack of the heap
    metadata.[¶](#section-2-22.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-2-22.1}
-   [attackers would have a significant degree of freedom in
    constructing shell code, since they can create arbitrary copy chains
    with various combinations of labels and compression
    pointers.[¶](#section-2-22.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-2-22.2}

Therefore, blindly following compression pointers may lead not only to
Denial-of-Service conditions, as pointed out by
\[[DNS-COMPRESSION](#I-D.ietf-dnsind-local-compression){.xref}\], but
also to successful Remote Code Execution attacks, as there may be other
implementation issues present within the corresponding
code.[¶](#section-2-23){.pilcrow}

Some implementations may not follow \[[RFC1035](#RFC1035){.xref}\],
which states:[¶](#section-2-24){.pilcrow}

> The first two bits are ones. This allows a pointer to be distinguished
> from a label, since the label must begin with two zero bits because
> labels are restricted to 63 octets or less. (The 10 and 01
> combinations are reserved for future use.)[¶](#section-2-25){.pilcrow}

Figures [2](#snippet_2){.xref} and [3](#snippet_3){.xref} show
pseudocode that implements two functions that check whether a given
octet is a compression pointer; [Figure 2](#snippet_2){.xref} shows a
correct implementation, and [Figure 3](#snippet_3){.xref} shows an
incorrect (broken) implementation.[¶](#section-2-26){.pilcrow}

[Figure 3](#figure-3){.selfRef}: [Broken Compression Pointer
Check](#name-broken-compression-pointer-){.selfRef}
:::

The correct implementation ([Figure 2](#snippet_2){.xref}) ensures that
the two most significant bits of an octet are both set, while the broken
implementation ([Figure 3](#snippet_3){.xref}) would consider an octet
with only one of the two bits set to be a compression pointer. This is
likely an implementation mistake rather than an intended violation of
\[[RFC1035](#RFC1035){.xref}\], because there are no benefits in
supporting such compression pointer values. The implementations related
to \[[CVE-2020-24338](#CVE-2020-24338){.xref}\] and
\[[CVE-2020-24335](#CVE-2020-24335){.xref}\] had a broken compression
pointer check, similar to the code shown in [Figure
3](#snippet_3){.xref}.[¶](#section-2-29){.pilcrow}

While incorrect implementations alone do not lead to vulnerabilities,
they may have unforeseen side effects when combined with other
vulnerabilities. For instance, the first octet of the value \"0x4130\"
may be incorrectly interpreted as a label length by a broken
implementation. Such a label length (65) is invalid and is larger than
63 (as per \[[RFC1035](#RFC1035){.xref}\]); a packet that has this value
should be discarded. However, the function shown in [Figure
3](#snippet_3){.xref} will consider \"0x41\" to be a valid compression
pointer, and the packet may pass the validation
steps.[¶](#section-2-30){.pilcrow}

This might give attackers additional leverage for constructing payloads
and circumventing the existing DNS packet validation
mechanisms.[¶](#section-2-31){.pilcrow}

The first occurrence of a compression pointer in an RR (an octet with
the two highest bits set to 1) must resolve to an octet within a DNS
record with a value that is greater than 0 (i.e., it must not be a
Null-terminator) and less than 64. The offset at which this octet is
located must be smaller than the offset at which the compression pointer
is located; once an implementation makes sure of that, compression
pointer loops can never occur.[¶](#section-2-32){.pilcrow}

In small DNS implementations (e.g., embedded TCP/IP stacks), support for
nested compression pointers (pointers that point to a compressed name)
should be discouraged: there is very little to be gained in terms of
performance versus the high probability of introducing errors such as
those discussed above.[¶](#section-2-33){.pilcrow}

The code that implements domain name parsing should check the offset
with respect to not only the bounds of a packet but also its position
with respect to the compression pointer in question. A compression
pointer must not be \"followed\" more than once. We have seen several
implementations using a check that ensures that a compression pointer is
not followed more than several times. A better alternative may be to
ensure that the target of a compression pointer is always located before
the location of the pointer in the packet.[¶](#section-2-34){.pilcrow}

## [3.](#section-3){.section-number .selfRef} [Label and Name Length Validation](#name-label-and-name-length-valid){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-label-and-name-length-valid}

\[[RFC1035](#RFC1035){.xref}\] restricts the length of name labels to 63
octets and lengths of domain names to 255 octets (i.e., label octets and
label length octets). Some implementations do not explicitly enforce
these restrictions.[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

Consider the function \"copy_domain_name()\" shown in [Figure
4](#snippet_4){.xref} below. The function is a variant of the
\"decompress_domain_name()\" function ([Figure 1](#snippet_1){.xref}),
with the difference that it does not support compressed labels and only
copies decompressed labels into the name
buffer.[¶](#section-3-2){.pilcrow}

Names](#name-a-broken-implementation-of-a){.selfRef}
:::

This implementation does not explicitly check for the value of the label
length octet: this value can be up to 255 octets, and a single label can
fill the name buffer. Depending on the memory layout of the target, how
the name buffer is allocated, and the size of the malformed packet, it
is possible to trigger various memory corruption
issues.[¶](#section-3-4){.pilcrow}

Both Figures [1](#snippet_1){.xref} and [4](#snippet_4){.xref} restrict
the size of the name buffer to 255 octets; however, there are no
restrictions on the actual number of octets that will be copied into
this buffer. In this particular case, a subsequent copy operation (if
another label is present in the packet) will write past the name buffer,
allowing heap or stack metadata to be overwritten in a controlled
manner.[¶](#section-3-5){.pilcrow}

Similar examples of vulnerable implementations can be found in the code
relevant to \[[CVE-2020-25110](#CVE-2020-25110){.xref}\],
\[[CVE-2020-15795](#CVE-2020-15795){.xref}\], and
\[[CVE-2020-27009](#CVE-2020-27009){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3-6){.pilcrow}

As a general recommendation, a domain label length octet must have a
value of more than 0 and less than 64 \[[RFC1035](#RFC1035){.xref}\]. If
this is not the case, an invalid value has been provided within the
packet, or a value at an invalid position might be interpreted as a
domain name length due to other errors in the packet (e.g., misplaced
Null-terminator or invalid compression
pointer).[¶](#section-3-7){.pilcrow}

The number of domain label characters must correspond to the value of
the domain label octet. To avoid possible errors when interpreting the
characters of a domain label, developers may consider recommendations
for the preferred domain name syntax outlined in
\[[RFC1035](#RFC1035){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3-8){.pilcrow}

The domain name length must not be more than 255 octets, including the
size of decompressed domain names. The NUL octet (\"0x00\") must be
present at the end of the domain name and must be within the maximum
name length (255 octets).[¶](#section-3-9){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-4 .section}
## [4.](#section-4){.section-number .selfRef} [Null-Terminator Placement Validation](#name-null-terminator-placement-v){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-null-terminator-placement-v}

A domain name must end with a NUL (\"0x00\") octet, as per
\[[RFC1035](#RFC1035){.xref}\]. The implementations shown in
Figures [1](#snippet_1){.xref} and [4](#snippet_4){.xref} assume that
this is the case for the RRs that they process; however, names that do
not have a NUL octet placed at the proper position within an RR are not
discarded.[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

This issue is closely related to the absence of label and name length
checks. For example, the logic behind Figures [1](#snippet_1){.xref} and
[4](#snippet_4){.xref} will continue to copy octets into the name buffer
until a NUL octet is encountered. This octet can be placed at an
arbitrary position within an RR or not placed at
all.[¶](#section-4-2){.pilcrow}

Consider the pseudocode function shown in [Figure 5](#snippet_5){.xref}.
The function returns the length of a domain name (\"name\") in octets to
be used elsewhere (e.g., to allocate a name buffer of a certain size):
for compressed domain names, the function returns 2; for decompressed
names, it returns their true length using the \"strlen(3)\"
function.[¶](#section-4-3){.pilcrow}

[Figure 5](#figure-5){.selfRef}: [A Broken Implementation of a Function
That Returns the Length of a Domain
Name](#name-a-broken-implementation-of-a-){.selfRef}
:::

\"strlen(3)\" is a standard C library function that returns the length
of a given sequence of characters terminated by the NUL (\"0x00\")
octet. Since this function also expects names to be explicitly
Null-terminated, the return value \"strlen(3)\" may also be controlled
by attackers. Through the value of \"name_len\", attackers may control
the allocation of internal buffers or specify the number by octets
copied into these buffers, or they may perform other operations,
depending on the implementation specifics.[¶](#section-4-5){.pilcrow}

The absence of explicit checks for placement of the NUL octet may also
facilitate controlled memory reads and writes. An example of vulnerable
implementations can be found in the code relevant to
\[[CVE-2020-25107](#CVE-2020-25107){.xref}\],
\[[CVE-2020-17440](#CVE-2020-17440){.xref}\],

\[[CVE-2020-27736](#CVE-2020-27736){.xref}\].[¶](#section-4-6){.pilcrow}

As a general recommendation for mitigating such issues, developers
should never trust user data to be Null-terminated. For example, to
fix/mitigate the issue shown in the code in [Figure
5](#snippet_5){.xref}, developers should use the function
\"strnlen(3)\", which reads at most X characters (the second argument of
the function), and ensure that X is not larger than the buffer allocated
for the name.[¶](#section-4-7){.pilcrow}

## [5.](#section-5){.section-number .selfRef} [Response Data Length Validation](#name-response-data-length-valida){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-response-data-length-valida}

As stated in \[[RFC1035](#RFC1035){.xref}\], every RR contains a
variable-length string of octets that contains the retrieved resource
data (RDATA) (e.g., an IP address that corresponds to a domain name in
question). The length of the RDATA field is regulated by the resource
data length field (RDLENGTH), which is also present in an
RR.[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

Implementations that process RRs may not check for the validity of the
RDLENGTH field value when retrieving RDATA. Failing to do so may lead to
out-of-bound read issues, whose impact may vary significantly, depending
on the implementation specifics. We have observed instances of
Denial-of-Service conditions and information
leaks.[¶](#section-5-2){.pilcrow}

Therefore, the value of the data length byte in response DNS records
(RDLENGTH) must reflect the number of bytes available in the field that
describes the resource (RDATA). The format of RDATA must conform to the
TYPE and CLASS fields of the RR.[¶](#section-5-3){.pilcrow}

to \[[CVE-2020-25108](#CVE-2020-25108){.xref}\],

According to \[[RFC1035](#RFC1035){.xref}\], the DNS header contains
four two-octet fields that specify the amount of question records
(QDCOUNT), answer records (ANCOUNT), authority records (NSCOUNT), and
additional records (ARCOUNT).[¶](#section-6-1){.pilcrow}

[Figure 6](#snippet_6){.xref} illustrates a recurring implementation
anti-pattern for a function that processes DNS RRs. The function
\"process_dns_records()\" extracts the value of ANCOUNT
(\"num_answers\") and the pointer to the DNS data payload
(\"data_ptr\"). The function processes answer records in a loop,
decrementing the \"num_answers\" value after processing each record
until the value of \"num_answers\" becomes zero. For simplicity, we
assume that there is only one domain name per answer. Inside the loop,
the code calculates the domain name length (\"name_length\") and adjusts
the data payload pointer (\"data_ptr\") by the offset that corresponds
to \"name_length + 1\", so that the pointer lands on the first answer
record. Next, the answer record is retrieved and processed, and the
\"num_answers\" value is decremented.[¶](#section-6-2){.pilcrow}

If the ANCOUNT number retrieved from the header
(\"dns_header-\>ancount\") is not checked against the amount of data
available in the packet and it is, for example, larger than the number
of answer records available, the data pointer (\"data_ptr\") will read
outside the bounds of the packet. This may result in Denial-of-Service
conditions.[¶](#section-6-4){.pilcrow}

In this section, we used an example of processing answer records.
However, the same logic is often reused for implementing the processing
of other types of records, e.g., the number of question (QDCOUNT),
authority (NSCOUNT), and additional (ARCOUNT) records. The specified
numbers of these records must correspond to the actual data present
within the packet. Therefore, all record count fields must be checked
before fully parsing the contents of a packet. Specifically, [Section
6.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5625#section-6.3){.relref} of
\[[RFC5625](#RFC5625){.xref}\] recommends that such malformed DNS
