# RFC 8877 {#rfcnum}

# Guidelines for Defining Packet Timestamps {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

Various network protocols make use of binary-encoded timestamps that are
incorporated in the protocol packet format, referred to as \"packet
timestamps\" for short. This document specifies guidelines for defining
packet timestamp formats in networking protocols at various layers. It
also presents three recommended timestamp formats. The target audience
of this document includes network protocol designers. It is expected
that a new network protocol that requires a packet timestamp will, in
most cases, use one of the recommended timestamp formats. If none of the
recommended formats fits the protocol requirements, the new protocol
specification should specify the format of the packet timestamp
according to the guidelines in this
document.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

### [1.1.](#section-1.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Background](#name-background){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-background}

Timestamps are widely used in network protocols for various purposes:
for logging or reporting the time of an event, for messages in delay
measurement and clock synchronization protocols, and as part of a value
that is unlikely to repeat (nonce) in security
protocols.[¶](#section-1.1-1){.pilcrow}

Timestamps are represented in the RFC series in one of two forms:
text-based timestamps and packet timestamps. Text-based timestamps
\[[RFC3339](#RFC3339){.xref}\] are represented as user-friendly strings
and are widely used in the RFC series \-- for example, in information
objects and data models, e.g., \[[RFC5646](#RFC5646){.xref}\],
\[[RFC6991](#RFC6991){.xref}\], and \[[RFC7493](#RFC7493){.xref}\].
Packet timestamps, on the other hand, are represented by a compact
binary field that has a fixed size and are not intended to have a
human-friendly format. Packet timestamps are also very common in the RFC
series and are used, for example, for measuring delay and for
synchronizing clocks, e.g., \[[RFC5905](#RFC5905){.xref}\],
\[[RFC4656](#RFC4656){.xref}\], and
\[[RFC7323](#RFC7323){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1.1-2){.pilcrow}

### [1.2.](#section-1.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Scope of this Document](#name-scope-of-this-document){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-scope-of-this-document}

This document presents guidelines for defining a packet timestamp format
in network protocols. Three recommended timestamp formats are presented.
It is expected that a new network protocol that requires a packet
timestamp will, in most cases, use one of these recommended timestamp
formats. In some cases, a network protocol may use more than one of the
recommended timestamp formats. However, if none of the recommended
formats fits the protocol requirements, the new protocol specification
should specify the format of the packet timestamp according to the
guidelines in this document.[¶](#section-1.2-1){.pilcrow}

The rationale behind defining a relatively small set of recommended
formats is that it enables significant reuse; network protocols can
typically reuse the timestamp format of the Network Time Protocol (NTP)
\[[RFC5905](#RFC5905){.xref}\] or the Precision Time Protocol (PTP)
\[[IEEE1588](#IEEE1588){.xref}\], allowing a straightforward integration
with an NTP- or PTP-based timer. Moreover, since accurate timestamping
mechanisms are often implemented in hardware, a new network protocol
that reuses an existing timestamp format can be quickly deployed using
existing hardware timestamping
capabilities.[¶](#section-1.2-2){.pilcrow}

This document is intended as a reference for network protocol designers.
When defining a network protocol that uses a packet timestamp, the
recommended timestamp formats should be considered first ([Section
4](#Recommended){.xref}). If one of these formats is used, it should be
referenced along the lines of the examples in Sections
[6.1](#Ex1Sec){.xref} and [6.2](#Ex2Sec){.xref}. If none of the
recommended formats fits the required functionality, then a new
timestamp format should be defined using the template in [Section
3](#format){.xref}.[¶](#section-1.3-1){.pilcrow}

This document recommends using the timestamp formats defined in [Section
4](#Recommended){.xref}. In cases where these timestamp formats do not
satisfy the protocol requirements, the timestamp specification should
clearly state the reasons for defining a new format. Moreover, it is
recommended to derive the new timestamp format from an existing
timestamp format, either a timestamp format from this document or any
other previously defined timestamp format.[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

The timestamp specification must unambiguously define the syntax and
semantics of the timestamp. The current section defines the minimum set
of attributes, but it should be noted that in some cases, additional
attributes or aspects will need to be defined in the timestamp
specification.[¶](#section-3-2){.pilcrow}

This section defines a template for specifying packet timestamps. A
timestamp format specification [MUST]{.bcp14} include at least the
following aspects:[¶](#section-3-3){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

Timestamp syntax:

    Size:

    :   The number of bits (or octets) used to represent the packet
        timestamp field. If the timestamp is comprised of more than one
        field, the size of each field is specified. Network order (big
        endian) is assumed by default; if this is not the case, then
        this section explicitly specifies the
        endianity.[¶](#section-3-4.2.1.2.1){.pilcrow}

Timestamp semantics:

    Units:

    :   The units used to represent the timestamp. If the timestamp is
        comprised of more than one field, the units of each field are
        specified. If a field is limited to a specific range of values,
        this section specifies the permitted range of
        values.[¶](#section-3-5.2.1.2.1){.pilcrow}

    :   

    Resolution:

    :   The timestamp resolution; the resolution is equal to the
        timestamp field unit. If the timestamp consists of two or more
        fields using different time units, then the resolution is the
        smallest time unit.[¶](#section-3-5.2.1.4.1){.pilcrow}

    :   

    Wraparound:

    :   The wraparound period of the timestamp; any further
        wraparound-related considerations should be described
        here.[¶](#section-3-5.2.1.6.1){.pilcrow}

    :   

    Epoch:

    :   The origin of the timescale used for the timestamp; the moment
        in time used as a reference for the timestamp value. For
        example, the epoch may be based on a standard time scale, such
        as UTC. Another example is a relative timestamp, in which the
        epoch could be the time at which the device using the timestamp
        was powered up and is not affected by leap seconds (see the next
        attribute).[¶](#section-3-5.2.1.8.1){.pilcrow}

    :   

    Leap seconds:

    :   This subsection specifies whether the timestamp is affected by
        leap seconds. If the timestamp is affected by leap seconds, then
        it represents the time elapsed since the epoch minus the number
        of leap seconds that have occurred since the
        epoch.[¶](#section-3-5.2.1.10.1){.pilcrow}

Synchronization aspects:
:   The specification of a network protocol that makes use of a packet
    timestamp is expected to include the synchronization aspects of
    using the timestamp. While the synchronization aspects are not
    strictly part of the timestamp format specification, these aspects
    provide the necessary context for using the timestamp within the
    scope of the protocol. In some cases, timestamps are used without
    synchronization, e.g., a timestamp that indicates the number of
    seconds since power-up. In such cases, the Synchronization Aspects
    section will specify that the timestamp does not correspond to a
    synchronized time reference and may discuss how this affects the
    usage of the timestamp. Further details about synchronization
    aspects are discussed in [Section
    5](#SynchSec){.xref}.[¶](#section-3-6.2){.pilcrow}

## [4.](#section-4){.section-number .selfRef} [Recommended Timestamp Formats](#name-recommended-timestamp-forma){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-recommended-timestamp-forma}

This document defines a set of recommended timestamp formats. Clearly,
different network protocols may have different requirements and
constraints; consequently, they may use different timestamp formats. The
choice of a specific timestamp format for a given protocol may depend on
various factors. A few examples of factors that may affect the choice of
the timestamp format include the following:[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

-   [Timestamp size: While some network protocols use a large timestamp
    field, in some cases, there may be constraints with respect to the
    timestamp size, affecting the choice of the timestamp
    format.[¶](#section-4-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-4-2.1}
-   [Resolution: The time resolution is another factor that may directly
    affect the selected timestamp format. A potentially important factor
    in this context is extensibility; it may be desirable to allow a
    timestamp format to be extensible to a higher resolution by
    extending the field. For example, the resolution of the NTP 32-bit
    timestamp format can be improved by extending it to the NTP 64-bit
    timestamp format in a straightforward
    way.[¶](#section-4-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-4-2.2}
-   [Wraparound period: The length of the time interval in which the
    timestamp is unique may also be an important factor in choosing the
    timestamp format. Along with the timestamp resolution, these two
    factors determine the required number of bits in the
    timestamp.[¶](#section-4-2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-4-2.3}
-   [Common format for multiple protocols: If there are two or more
    network protocols that use timestamps and are often used together in
    typical systems, using a common timestamp format should be preferred
    if possible. For example, if the network protocol that is being
    defined typically runs on a PC, then an NTP-based timestamp format
    may allow easier integration with an NTP-synchronized timer. In
    contrast, a protocol that is typically deployed on a hardware-based
    platform may make better use of a PTP-based timestamp, allowing more
    efficient integration with a PTP-synchronized
    timer.[¶](#section-4-2.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-4-2.4}

## [5.](#section-5){.section-number .selfRef} [Synchronization Aspects](#name-synchronization-aspects){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-synchronization-aspects}

A specification that defines a new timestamp format or uses one of the
recommended timestamp formats should include a Synchronization Aspects
section. Note that the recommended timestamp formats defined in this
document ([Section 4](#Recommended){.xref}) do not include the
synchronization aspects of these timestamp formats, but it is expected
that specifications of network protocols that make use of these formats
should include the synchronization aspects. Examples of a
Synchronization Aspects section can be found in [Section
6](#UseCaseSec){.xref}.[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

The Synchronization Aspects section should specify all the assumptions
and requirements related to synchronization. For example, the
synchronization aspects may specify whether nodes populating the
timestamps should be synchronized among themselves and whether the
timestamp is measured with respect to a central reference clock such as
an NTP server. If time is assumed to be synchronized to a time standard
such as UTC or TAI, it should be specified in this section. Further
considerations may be discussed in this section, such as the required
timestamp accuracy and precision.[¶](#section-5-2){.pilcrow}

Another aspect that should be discussed in this section is leap second
\[[RFC5905](#RFC5905){.xref}\] considerations. The timestamp
specification template ([Section 3](#format){.xref}) specifies whether
the timestamp is affected by leap seconds. It is often the case that
further details about leap seconds will need to be defined in the
Synchronization Aspects section. Generally speaking, a leap second is a
one-second adjustment that is occasionally applied to UTC in order to
keep it aligned with solar time. A leap second may be either positive or
negative, i.e., the clock may either be shifted one second forward or
backward. All leap seconds that have occurred up to the publication of
this document have been in the backward direction, and although forward
leap seconds are theoretically possible, the text throughout this
document focuses on the common case, which is the backward leap second.
In a timekeeping system that considers leap seconds, the system clock
may be affected by a leap second in one of three possible
ways:[¶](#section-5-3){.pilcrow}

-   [The clock is turned backwards one second at the end of the leap
    second.[¶](#section-5-4.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-5-4.1}
-   [The clock is frozen during the duration of the leap
    second.[¶](#section-5-4.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-5-4.2}
-   [The clock is slowed down during the leap second and adjacent time
    intervals until the new time value catches up. The interval for this
    process, commonly referred to as \"leap smear\", can range from
    several seconds to several hours before, during, and/or after the
    occurrence of the leap
    second.[¶](#section-5-4.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-5-4.3}

The way leap seconds are handled depends on the synchronization protocol
and is thus not specified in this document. However, if a timestamp
format is defined with respect to a timescale that is affected by leap
seconds, the Synchronization Aspects section should specify how the use
of leap seconds affects the timestamp usage.[¶](#section-5-5){.pilcrow}

    NTP-synchronized clock, allowing the timestamp to be measured with
    respect to the clock of an NTP server. Since the NTP time format is
    affected by leap seconds, the current timestamp format is similarly
    affected. Thus, the value of a timestamp during and possibly before

## [7.](#section-7){.section-number .selfRef} [Packet Timestamp Control Field](#name-packet-timestamp-control-fi){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-packet-timestamp-control-fi}

In some cases, it is desirable to have a control field that describes
the structure, format, content, and properties of timestamps. Control
information about the timestamp format can be conveyed in some protocols
using a dedicated control plane protocol or may be made available at the
management plane, for example, using a YANG data model. An optional
control field allows some of the control information to be attached to
the timestamp.[¶](#section-7-1){.pilcrow}

An example of a packet timestamp control field is the Error Estimate
field, defined by [Section
4.1.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4656#section-4.1.2){.relref} of
\[[RFC4656](#RFC4656){.xref}\], which is used in the One-Way Active
Measurement Protocol (OWAMP) \[[RFC4656](#RFC4656){.xref}\] and Two-Way
Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP) \[[RFC5357](#RFC5357){.xref}\]. The
Root Dispersion and Root Delay fields in the NTP header
\[[RFC5905](#RFC5905){.xref}\] are two examples of fields that provide
information about the timestamp precision. Another example of an
auxiliary field is the Correction Field in the PTP header
\[[IEEE1588](#IEEE1588){.xref}\]; its value is used as a correction to
the timestamp and may be assigned by the sender of the PTP message and
updated by transit nodes (Transparent Clocks) in order to account for
the delay along the path.[¶](#section-7-2){.pilcrow}

This section defines high-level guidelines for defining packet timestamp
control fields in network protocols that can benefit from such
timestamp-related control information. The word \"requirements\" is used
in its informal context in this section.[¶](#section-7-3){.pilcrow}

### [7.1.](#section-7.1){.section-number .selfRef} [High-Level Control Field Requirements](#name-high-level-control-field-re){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-high-level-control-field-re}

A control field for packet timestamps must offer an adequate feature set
and fulfill a series of requirements to be usable and accepted. The
following list captures the main high-level requirements for timestamp
fields.[¶](#section-7.1-1){.pilcrow}

1.  [Extensible Feature Set: Protocols and applications depend on
    various timestamp characteristics. A timestamp control field must
    support a variable number of elements (components) that either
    describe or quantify timestamp-specific characteristics or
    parameters. Examples of potential elements include timestamp size,
    encoding, accuracy, leap seconds, reference clock identifiers,
    etc.[¶](#section-7.1-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-7.1-2.1}
2.  [Size: Essential for an efficient use of timestamp control fields is
    the trade-off between supported features and control field size.
    Protocols and applications may select the specific control field
    elements that are needed for their operation from the set of
    available
    elements.[¶](#section-7.1-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-7.1-2.2}
3.  [Composition: Applications may depend on specific control field
    elements being present in messages. The status of these elements may
    be either mandatory, conditional mandatory, or optional, depending
    on the specific application and context. A control field
    specification must support applications in conveying or
    negotiating (a) the set of control field elements along with (b) the
    status of any element (i.e., mandatory, conditional mandatory, or
    optional) by defining appropriate data structures and identity
    codes.[¶](#section-7.1-2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-7.1-2.3}
4.  [Category: Control field elements can characterize either static
    timestamp information (e.g., timestamp size in bytes and timestamp
    semantics: NTP 64-bit format) or runtime timestamp information
    (e.g., estimated timestamp accuracy at the time of sampling: 20
    microseconds to UTC). For efficiency reasons, it may be meaningful
    to support separation of these two concepts: while the former
    (static) information is typically valid throughout a protocol
    session and may be conveyed only once, at session establishment
    time, the latter (runtime) information augments any timestamp
    instance and may cause substantial overhead for high-traffic
    protocols.[¶](#section-7.1-2.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-7.1-2.4}

Proposals for timestamp control fields will be defined in separate
documents and are out of scope of this
document.[¶](#section-7.1-3){.pilcrow}

## [9.](#section-9){.section-number .selfRef} [Security Considerations](#name-security-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-security-considerations}

A network protocol that uses a packet timestamp [MUST]{.bcp14} specify
the security considerations that result from using the timestamp. This
section provides an overview of some of the common security
considerations of using timestamps.[¶](#section-9-1){.pilcrow}

Any metadata that is attached to control or data packets, and
specifically packet timestamps, can facilitate network reconnaissance;
by passively eavesdropping on timestamped packets, an attacker can
gather information about the network performance and the level of
synchronization between nodes.[¶](#section-9-2){.pilcrow}

In some cases, timestamps could be spoofed or modified by on-path
attackers, thus attacking the application that uses the timestamps. For
example, if timestamps are used in a delay measurement protocol, an
attacker can modify en route timestamps in a way that manipulates the
measurement results. Integrity protection mechanisms, such as Message
Authentication Codes (MACs), can mitigate such attacks. The
specification of an integrity protection mechanism is outside the scope
of this document as, typically, integrity protection will be defined on
a per-network-protocol basis and not specifically for the timestamp
field.[¶](#section-9-3){.pilcrow}

Another potential threat that can have a similar impact is delay
attacks. An attacker can maliciously delay some or all of the en route
messages, with the same harmful implications as described in the
previous paragraph. Mitigating delay attacks is a significant challenge;
in contrast to spoofing and modification attacks, the delay attack
cannot be prevented by cryptographic integrity protection mechanisms. In
some cases, delay attacks can be mitigated by sending the timestamped
information through multiple paths, allowing detection of and resistance
to an attacker that has access to one of the
paths.[¶](#section-9-4){.pilcrow}

In many cases, timestamping relies on an underlying synchronization
mechanism. Thus, any attack that compromises the synchronization
mechanism can also compromise protocols that use timestamping. Attacks
on time protocols are discussed in detail in
\[[RFC7384](#RFC7384){.xref}\].[¶](#section-9-5){.pilcrow}
