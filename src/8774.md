# RFC 8774 {#rfcnum}

# The Quantum Bug {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

The age of quantum networking is upon us, and with it comes
\"entanglement\": a procedure in which a state (i.e., a bit) can be
transferred instantly, with no measurable delay between peers. This will
lead to a perceived round-trip time of zero seconds on some Internet
paths, a capability which was not predicted and so not included as a
possibility in many protocol specifications. Worse than the millennium
bug, this unexpected value is bound to cause serious Internet failures
unless the specifications are fixed in
time.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC6921](#RFC6921){.xref}\] discusses faster-than-light
communication, where packets arrive before they are sent. While it is
amusing to entertain the possibility of time travel, we have to accept
the cold facts: time travel will never work (or it would already have
been used). Quantum networking, however, is an entirely different matter
\-- commercial products are already available, and quantum networks will
without a doubt become the prevalent Internet link-layer technology
across the globe within the next five to ten
years.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

With the help of entanglement, implemented in quantum repeaters, quantum
networks can transfer information faster than ever before: a state can
be transmitted over a long distance instantly, with no delay. This is so
cool that it is also called (and, by some, mistaken for) teleportation.
If a path between a sender and a receiver is fully quantum-ized, the
measured one-way delay (OWD) will be zero. What\'s more, assuming that
there are blazing fast quantum computers involved on both ends, the
processing time will be well below anything measurable; hence, even the
round-trip time (RTT) will be zero in these
scenarios.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

In today\'s Internet, only very few protocols are prepared for such
\"0-RTT\" situations (e.g., TCP with \"TCP Fast Open\" (TFO)
\[[RFC7413](#RFC7413){.xref}\], TLS 1.3 \[[RFC8446](#RFC8446){.xref}\],
and QUIC \[[QUIC-TRANS](#I-D.ietf-quic-transport){.xref}\]). Many others
will fail in interesting ways; we coin the term \"Quantum Bug\" for such
failures. In the following section, we will discuss some examples of
Quantum Bugs.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

## [2.](#section-2){.section-number .selfRef} [Protocols and Protocol Mechanisms That Will Fail](#name-protocols-and-protocol-mech){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-protocols-and-protocol-mech}

The number of protocols and protocol mechanisms that will fail in the
face of a zero RTT is too large to report here; we are truly heading
towards something close to an Internet meltdown. We can only provide
some guidance to those who hunt for the Quantum Bug, by discussing
examples of specification mistakes that will need to be
fixed.[¶](#section-2-1){.pilcrow}

::: {#LEDBAT}
::: {#section-2.1 .section}
### [2.1.](#section-2.1){.section-number .selfRef} [LEDBAT](#name-ledbat){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-ledbat}

The Low Extra Delay Background Transfer (LEDBAT) congestion control
mechanism \[[RFC6817](#RFC6817){.xref}\] is a very interesting failure
case: designed to \"get out of the way\" of other traffic; it will end
up sending as fast as possible. Specifically, when the algorithm
described in [Section
2.4.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6817#section-2.4.2){.relref} of
\[[RFC6817](#RFC6817){.xref}\] obtains a delay sample, it updates a list
of base delays that will all become 0 and current delays that will also
all become 0. It calculates a queuing delay as the difference between
the current delay and the base delay (resulting in 0) and keeps
increasing the Congestion Window (cwnd) until the queuing delay reaches
a predefined parameter value TARGET (100 milliseconds or
less).[¶](#section-2.1-1){.pilcrow}

A TARGET value of 100 milliseconds will never be reached, because the
queuing delay does not grow when the sender increases its cwnd; this
means that LEDBAT would endlessly increase its cwnd, limited only by the
number of bits that are used to represent cwnd. However, given that
TARGET=0 is also allowed, this parameter choice may seem to be a way
out. Always staying at the target means that the sender would maintain
its initial cwnd, which should be set to 2. This may seem like a small
number, but remember that cwnd is the number of bytes that can be
transmitted per RTT (which is 0). Thus, irrespective of the TARGET
value, the sender will send data as fast as it
can.[¶](#section-2.1-2){.pilcrow}

### [2.2.](#section-2.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Multipath TCP (MPTCP)](#name-multipath-tcp-mptcp){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-multipath-tcp-mptcp}

The coupled congestion control mechanism proposed for MPTCP in
\[[RFC6356](#RFC6356){.xref}\] requires calculating a value called
\"alpha\". Equation 2 in \[[RFC6356](#RFC6356){.xref}\] contains a term
where a value called \"cwnd_i\" is divided by the square of the RTT, and
another term where this value is divided by the RTT. Enough
said.[¶](#section-2.2-1){.pilcrow}

### [2.3.](#section-2.3){.section-number .selfRef} [RTP Circuit Breakers](#name-rtp-circuit-breakers){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-rtp-circuit-breakers}

The RTP Circuit Breakers \[[RFC8083](#RFC8083){.xref}\] require
calculation of a well-known equation which yields the throughput of a
TCP connection:[¶](#section-2.3-1){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-2.3-2 .artwork .art-text .alignLeft}
                              s
    X = -------------------------------------------------------------
      Tr*sqrt(2*b*p/3)+(t_RTO * (3*sqrt(3*b*p/8) * p * (1+32*p*p)))

[¶](#section-2.3-2){.pilcrow}
:::

where Tr is the RTT and t_RTO is the retransmission timeout of TCP (we
don\'t need to care about the other variables). As we will discuss in
[Section 3](#Solution){.xref}, t_RTO is lower-bounded with 1 second;
therefore, it saves us from a division by zero. However, there is also a
simplified version of this equation:[¶](#section-2.3-3){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-2.3-4 .artwork .art-text .alignLeft}
              s
    X = ----------------
        Tr*sqrt(2*b*p/3)

[¶](#section-2.3-4){.pilcrow}
:::

Unfortunately, \[[RFC8083](#RFC8083){.xref}\] states: \"It is
RECOMMENDED that this simplified throughput equation be used since the
reduction in accuracy is small, and it is much simpler to calculate than
the full equation.\" Due to this simplification, many multimedia
applications will crash.[¶](#section-2.3-5){.pilcrow}

## [3.](#section-3){.section-number .selfRef} [What can be done?](#name-what-can-be-done){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-what-can-be-done}

Fear not: when everything else fails, TCP will still work. Its
retransmission timeout is lower-bounded by 1 second
\[[RFC6298](#RFC6298){.xref}\]. Moreover, while its cwnd may grow up to
the maximum storable number, data transmission is limited by the
Receiver Window (rwnd). This means that flow control will save TCP from
failing.[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

From this, we can learn two simple rules: lower-bound any values
calculated from the RTT (and, obviously, do not divide by the RTT), and
use flow control. Specifications will need to be updated by fixing all
RTT-based calculations and introducing flow control everywhere. For
example, UDP will have to be extended with a receiver window, e.g., as a
UDP option
\[[UDP-OPT](#I-D.ietf-tsvwg-udp-options){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3-2){.pilcrow}

::: {#conclusion}
::: {#section-4 .section}
## [4.](#section-4){.section-number .selfRef} [Conclusion](#name-conclusion){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-conclusion}

We are in trouble, and there is only one way out: develop a
comprehensive list of all RFCs containing \"0-RTT\" mistakes (taking
\[[RFC2626](#RFC2626){.xref}\] as a guideline), and update all code.
This needs to happen fast, the clock is ticking. Luckily, if we are too
slow, we will still be able to use TCP to access the specifications.
With DNS over TCP \[[RFC7766](#RFC7766){.xref}\], name resolution to
find the server containing the specifications should also
work.[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

Flow control must be used on 0-RTT paths, or else an attacker can
completely overwhelm a sender with data in a denial-of-service (DoS)
attack within an instant. Flow control will need to be added to
protocols that do not currently have it, such as UDP or ICMP. IPv6 will
not save us.[¶](#section-6-1){.pilcrow}
