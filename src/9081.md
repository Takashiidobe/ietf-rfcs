# RFC 9081 {#rfcnum}

# Interoperation between Multicast Virtual Private Network (MVPN) and Multicast Source Directory Protocol (MSDP) Source-Active Routes {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

This document specifies the procedures for interoperation between
Multicast Virtual Private Network (MVPN) Source-Active (SA) routes and
customer Multicast Source Discovery Protocol (MSDP) SA routes, which is
useful for MVPN provider networks offering services to customers with an
existing MSDP infrastructure. Without the procedures described in this
document, VPN-specific MSDP sessions are required among the Provider
Edge (PE) routers that are customer MSDP peers. This document updates
RFC 6514.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

Section [14](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6514#section-14){.relref}
( [\"Supporting PIM-SM without Inter-Site Shared
C-Trees\"](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6514#section-14){.relref})
of \[[RFC6514](#RFC6514){.xref}\] specifies the procedures for MVPN PEs
to discover (C-S,C-G) via MVPN Source-Active A-D routes and then send
Source Tree Join (C-S,C-G) C-multicast routes towards the ingress PEs to
establish shortest path trees (SPTs) for customer Any-Source Multicast
(ASM) flows for which they have downstream receivers. (C-\*,C-G)
C-multicast routes are not sent among the PEs, so inter-site shared
C-Trees are not used, and the method is generally referred to as
\"spt-only\" mode.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

With this mode, the MVPN Source-Active routes are functionally similar
to MSDP Source-Active messages. For a VPN, one or more of the PEs, say
PE1, either acts as a C-RP and learns of (C-S,C-G) via PIM Register
messages or has MSDP sessions with some MSDP peers and learns of
(C-S,C-G) via MSDP SA messages. In either case, PE1 will then originate
MVPN SA routes for other PEs to learn
(C-S,C-G).[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC6514](#RFC6514){.xref}\] only specifies that a PE receiving the
MVPN SA routes, say PE2, will advertise Source Tree Join (C-S,C-G)
C-multicast routes if it has corresponding (C-\*,C-G) state learnt from
its Customer Edge (CE). PE2 may also have MSDP sessions for the VPN with
other C-RPs at its site, but \[[RFC6514](#RFC6514){.xref}\] does not
specify that PE2 advertises MSDP SA messages to those MSDP peers for the
(C-S,C-G) that it learns via MVPN SA routes. PE2 would need to have an
MSDP session with PE1 (that advertised the MVPN SA messages) to learn
the sources via MSDP SA messages for it to advertise the MSDP SA to its
local peers. To make things worse, unless blocked by policy control, PE2
would in turn advertise MVPN SA routes because of those MSDP SA messages
that it receives from PE1, which are redundant and unnecessary. Also
notice that the PE1-PE2 MSDP session is VPN specific (i.e., only for a
single VPN), while the BGP sessions over which the MVPN routes are
advertised are not.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

If a PE does advertise MSDP SA messages based on received MVPN SA
routes, the VPN-specific MSDP sessions with other PEs are no longer
needed. Additionally, this MVPN/MSDP SA interoperation has the following
inherent benefits for a BGP-based solution.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

-   [MSDP SA refreshes are replaced with BGP hard
    state.[¶](#section-1-5.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-5.1}
-   [Route reflectors can be used instead of having peer-to-peer
    sessions.[¶](#section-1-5.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-5.2}
-   [VPN extranet \[[RFC2764](#RFC2764){.xref}\] mechanisms can be used
    to propagate (C-S,C-G) information across VPNs with flexible policy
    control.[¶](#section-1-5.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-5.3}

While MSDP Source-Active routes contain the source, group, and RP
addresses of a given multicast flow, MVPN Source-Active routes only
contain the source and group. MSDP requires the RP address information
in order to perform MSDP peer Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF). Therefore,
this document describes how to convey the RP address information into
the MVPN Source-Active route using an Extended Community so this
information can be shared with an existing MSDP
infrastructure.[¶](#section-1-6){.pilcrow}

The procedures apply to Global Table Multicast (GTM)
\[[RFC7716](#RFC7716){.xref}\] as well.[¶](#section-1-7){.pilcrow}

For comparison, another method of supporting customer ASM is generally
referred to as \"rpt-spt\" mode. Section
[13](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6514#section-13){.relref}
([\"Switching from a Shared C-Tree to a Source
C-Tree\"](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6514#section-13){.relref})
of \[[RFC6514](#RFC6514){.xref}\] specifies the MVPN SA procedures for
that mode, but those SA routes are a replacement for PIM-ASM assert and
(s,g,rpt) prune mechanisms, not for source discovery purposes. MVPN/MSDP
SA interoperation for the \"rpt-spt\" mode is outside the scope of this
document. In the rest of the document, the \"spt-only\" mode is
assumed.[¶](#section-1.1-1){.pilcrow}

The MVPN PEs that act as customer RPs or have one or more MSDP sessions
in a VPN (or the global table in case of GTM) are treated as an MSDP
mesh group for that VPN (or the global table). In the rest of the
document, it is referred to as the PE mesh group. This PE mesh group
[MUST NOT]{.bcp14} include other MSDP speakers and is integrated into
the rest of the MSDP infrastructure for the VPN (or the global table)
following normal MSDP rules and practices.[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

When an MVPN PE advertises an MVPN SA route following procedures in
\[[RFC6514](#RFC6514){.xref}\] for the \"spt-only\" mode, it
[MUST]{.bcp14} attach an \"MVPN SA RP-address Extended Community\". This
is a Transitive IPv4-Address-Specific Extended Community. The Local
Administrator field is set to zero, and the Global Administrator field
is set to an RP address determined as the
following:[¶](#section-3-2){.pilcrow}

-   [If the (C-S,C-G) is learnt as a result of the PIM Register
    mechanism, the local RP address for the C-G is
    used.[¶](#section-3-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-3.1}
-   [If the (C-S,C-G) is learnt as a result of incoming MSDP SA
    messages, the RP address in the selected MSDP SA message is
    used.[¶](#section-3-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-3.2}

In addition to the procedures in \[[RFC6514](#RFC6514){.xref}\], an MVPN
PE may be provisioned to generate MSDP SA messages from received MVPN SA
routes, with or without local policy control. If a received MVPN SA
route triggers an MSDP SA message, the MVPN SA route is treated as if a
corresponding MSDP SA message was received from within the PE mesh group
and normal MSDP procedure is followed (e.g., an MSDP SA message is
advertised to other MSDP peers outside the PE mesh group). The (S,G)
information comes from the (C-S,C-G) encoding in the MVPN SA Network
Layer Reachability Information (NLRI), and the RP address comes from the
\"MVPN SA RP-address EC\" mentioned above. If the received MVPN SA route
does not have the EC (this could be from a legacy PE that does not have
the capability to attach the EC), the local RP address for the C-G is
used. In that case, it is possible that the RP inserted into the MSDP SA
message for the C-G is actually the MSDP peer to which the generated
MSDP message is advertised, causing the peer to discard it due to RPF
failure. To get around that problem, the peer [SHOULD]{.bcp14} use local
policy to accept the MSDP SA message.[¶](#section-3-4){.pilcrow}

An MVPN PE [MAY]{.bcp14} treat only the best MVPN SA route selected by
the BGP route selection process (instead of all MVPN SA routes) for a
given (C-S,C-G) as a received MSDP SA message (and advertise the
corresponding MSDP message). In that case, if the selected best MVPN SA
route does not have the \"MVPN SA RP-address EC\" but another route for
the same (C-S, C-G) does, then the next best route with the EC
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} be chosen. As a result, if/when the best MVPN SA route
with the EC changes, a new MSDP SA message is advertised if the RP
address determined according to the newly selected MVPN SA route is
different from before. The MSDP SA state associated with the previously
advertised MSDP SA message with the older RP address will be timed
out.[¶](#section-3-5){.pilcrow}

## [4.](#section-4){.section-number .selfRef} [Security Considerations](#name-security-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-security-considerations}

\[[RFC6514](#RFC6514){.xref}\] specifies the procedure for a PE to
generate an MVPN SA upon discovering a (C-S,C-G) flow (e.g., via a
received MSDP SA message) in a VPN. This document extends this
capability in the reverse direction \-- upon receiving an MVPN SA route
in a VPN, generate a corresponding MSDP SA and advertise it to MSDP
peers in the same VPN. As such, the capabilities specified in this
document introduce no additional security considerations beyond those
already specified in \[[RFC6514](#RFC6514){.xref}\] and
\[[RFC3618](#RFC3618){.xref}\]. Moreover, the capabilities specified in
this document actually eliminate the control message amplification that
exists today where VPN-specific MSDP sessions are required among the PEs
that are customer MSDP peers, which lead to redundant messages (MSDP SAs
and MVPN SAs) being carried in parallel between
PEs.[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}
