# RFC 9188 {#rfcnum}

# Generic Multi-Access (GMA) Encapsulation Protocol {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

A device can be simultaneously connected to multiple networks, e.g.,
Wi-Fi, LTE, 5G, and DSL. It is desirable to seamlessly combine the
connectivity over these networks below the transport layer (L4) to
improve the quality of experience for applications that do not have
built-in multi-path capabilities. Such optimization requires additional
control information, e.g., a sequence number, in each packet. This
document presents a new lightweight and flexible encapsulation protocol
for this need. The solution has been developed by the authors based on
their experiences in multiple standards bodies including the IETF and
3GPP. However, this document is not an Internet Standard and does not
represent the consensus opinion of the IETF. This document will enable
other developers to build interoperable implementations in order to
experiment with the protocol.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

A device can be simultaneously connected to multiple networks, e.g.,
Wi-Fi, LTE, 5G, and DSL. It is desirable to seamlessly combine the
connectivity over these networks below the transport layer (L4) to
improve the quality of experience for applications that do not have
built-in multi-path capabilities.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

[Figure 1](#Fig1){.xref} shows the Multi-Access Management Service
(MAMS) user-plane protocol stack \[[MAMS](#RFC8743){.xref}\], which has
been used in today\'s multi-access solutions \[[ATSSS](#ATSSS){.xref}\]
\[[LWIPEP](#LWIPEP){.xref}\] \[[GRE1](#RFC2890){.xref}\]
\[[GRE2](#RFC8157){.xref}\]. It consists of two layers: convergence and
adaptation.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

The convergence layer is responsible for multi-access operations,
including multi-link (path) aggregation, splitting/reordering, lossless
switching/retransmission, fragmentation, concatenation, etc. It operates
on top of the adaptation layer in the protocol stack. From the
perspective of a transmitter, a User Payload (e.g., IP packet) is
processed by the convergence layer first and then by the adaptation
layer before being transported over a delivery connection; from the
receiver\'s perspective, an IP packet received over a delivery
connection is processed by the adaptation layer first and then by the
convergence layer.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

GRE (Generic Routing Encapsulation) \[[LWIPEP](#LWIPEP){.xref}\]
\[[GRE1](#RFC2890){.xref}\] \[[GRE2](#RFC8157){.xref}\] can be used as
the encapsulation protocol at the convergence layer to encode additional
control information, e.g., key and sequence number. However, there are
two main drawbacks with this approach:[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}

-   [It is difficult to introduce new control fields because the GRE
    header formats are already defined,
    and[¶](#section-1-6.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-6.1}
-   [IP-over-IP tunneling (required for GRE) leads to higher overhead
    especially for small
    packets.[¶](#section-1-6.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-6.2}

For example, the overhead of IP-over-IP/GRE tunneling with both key and
sequence Number is 32 bytes (20-byte IP header + 12-byte GRE header),
which is 80% of a 40-byte TCP ACK packet.[¶](#section-1-7){.pilcrow}

This document presents a lightweight Generic Multi-Access (GMA)
encapsulation protocol for the convergence layer. It supports three
encapsulation methods: trailer-based IP encapsulation, header-based IP
encapsulation, and non-IP encapsulation. Particularly, the IP
encapsulation methods avoid IP-over-IP tunneling overhead (20 bytes),
which is 50% of a 40-byte TCP ACK packet. Moreover, it introduces new
control fields to support fragmentation and concatenation, which are not
available in GRE-based solutions \[[LWIPEP](#LWIPEP){.xref}\]
\[[GRE1](#RFC2890){.xref}\]
\[[GRE2](#RFC8157){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-8){.pilcrow}

The GMA protocol only operates between endpoints that have been
configured to use GMA. This configuration can be through any control
messages and procedures, including, for example, Multi-Access Management
Services \[[MAMS](#RFC8743){.xref}\]. Moreover, UDP or IPsec tunneling
can be used at the adaptation sublayer to protect GMA operation from
intermediate nodes.[¶](#section-1-9){.pilcrow}

The solution described in this document was developed by the authors
based on their experiences in multiple standards bodies including the
IETF and 3GPP. However, this document is not an Internet Standard and
does not represent the consensus opinion of the IETF. This document
presents the protocol specification to enable experimentation as
described in [Section 1.1](#sect-1.1){.xref} and to facilitate other
interoperable implementations.[¶](#section-1-10){.pilcrow}

### [1.1.](#section-1.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Scope of Experiment](#name-scope-of-experiment){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-scope-of-experiment}

The protocol described in this document is an experiment. The objective
of the experiment is to determine whether the protocol meets the
requirements, can be safely used, and has support for
deployment.[¶](#section-1.1-1){.pilcrow}

[Section 4](#sect-4){.xref} describes three possible encapsulation
methods that are enabled by this protocol. Part of this experiment is to
assess whether all three mechanisms are necessary or whether, for
example, all implementations are able to support the main
\"trailer-based\" IP encapsulation method. Similarly, the experiment
will investigate the relative merits of the IP and non-IP encapsulation
methods.[¶](#section-1.1-2){.pilcrow}

It is expected that this protocol experiment can be conducted on the
Internet since the GMA packets are identified by an IP protocol number
and the protocol is intended for single-hop propagation; devices should
not be forwarding packets, and if they do, they will not need to examine
the payload, while destination systems that do not support this protocol
should not receive such packets and will handle them as unknown payloads
according to normal IP processing. Thus, experimentation is conducted
between consenting end systems that have been mutually configured to
participate in the experiment as described in [Section
7](#sect-7){.xref}.[¶](#section-1.1-3){.pilcrow}

Note that this experiment \"reuses\" the IP protocol identifier 114 as
described in [Section 4.4](#sect-4.4){.xref}. Part of this experiment is
to assess the safety of doing this. The experiment should consider the
following safety mechanisms:[¶](#section-1.1-4){.pilcrow}

-   [GMA endpoints [SHOULD]{.bcp14} detect non-GMA IP packets that also
    use 114 and log an error to report the situation (although such
    error logging [MUST]{.bcp14} be subject to rate
    limits).[¶](#section-1.1-5.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-1.1-5.1}
-   [GMA endpoints [SHOULD]{.bcp14} stop using 114 and switch to non-IP
    encapsulation, i.e., UDP encapsulation ([Figure 7](#Fig7){.xref}),
    after detecting any non-GMA usage of
    114.[¶](#section-1.1-5.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-1.1-5.2}

The experiment [SHOULD]{.bcp14} use a packet tracing tool, e.g.,
WireShark or TCPDUMP, to monitor both ingress and egress traffic at GMA
endpoints and ensure the above safety mechanisms are
implemented.[¶](#section-1.1-6){.pilcrow}

Path quality measurements (one-way delay, loss, etc.) and congestion
detection are performed by the receiver based on the GMA control fields,
e.g., Sequence Number, Timestamp, etc. The receiver will then
dynamically control how to split or steer traffic over multiple delivery
connections accordingly. The GMA control protocol
\[[GMAC](#I-D.zhu-intarea-gma-control){.xref}\] [MAY]{.bcp14} be used
for signaling between GMA endpoints. Another objective of the experiment
is to evaluate the usage of various receiver-based algorithms
\[[GCC](#GCC){.xref}\] \[[MPIP](#MPIP){.xref}\] in multi-path traffic
management and the impact on the End-to-End (E2E) performance
(throughput, delay, etc.) of higher-layer (transport) protocols, e.g.,
TCP, QUIC, WebRTC, etc.[¶](#section-1.1-7){.pilcrow}

The authors will continually assess the progress of this experiment and
encourage other implementers to contact them to report the status of
their implementations and their experiences with the
protocol.[¶](#section-1.1-8){.pilcrow}

As shown in [Figure 2](#Fig2){.xref}, a client device (e.g., smartphone,
laptop, etc.) may connect to the Internet via both Wi-Fi and LTE
connections, one of which (e.g., LTE) may operate as the anchor
connection, and the other (e.g., Wi-Fi) may operate as the delivery
connection. The anchor connection provides the IP address and
connectivity for end-to-end Internet access, and the delivery connection
provides an additional path between the client and Multi-Access Gateway
for multi-access optimizations.[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

For example, per-packet aggregation allows a single IP flow to use the
combined bandwidth of the two connections. In another example, packets
lost due to a temporary link outage may be retransmitted. Moreover,
packets may be duplicated over multiple connections to achieve high
reliability and low latency, where duplicated packets are eliminated by
the receiving side. Such multi-access optimization requires additional
control information, e.g., a sequence number, in each packet, which can
be supported by the GMA encapsulation protocol described in this
document.[¶](#section-3-4){.pilcrow}

The GMA protocol described in this document is designed for multiple
connections, but it may also be used when there is only one connection
between two endpoints. For example, it may be used for loss detection
and recovery. In another example, it may be used to concatenate multiple
small packets and reduce per-packet overhead.[¶](#section-3-5){.pilcrow}

The GMA encapsulation protocol supports the following three
methods:[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

-   [Trailer-based IP Encapsulation ([Section
    4.1](#sect-4.1){.xref})[¶](#section-4-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-4-2.1}
-   [Header-based IP Encapsulation ([Section
    4.2](#sect-4.2){.xref})[¶](#section-4-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-4-2.2}
-   [Header-based non-IP Encapsulation ([Section
    4.3](#sect-4.3){.xref})[¶](#section-4-2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-4-2.3}

Non-IP encapsulation [MUST]{.bcp14} be used if the original IP packet is
IPv6.[¶](#section-4-3){.pilcrow}

Trailer-based IP encapsulation [MUST]{.bcp14} be used if it is supported
by GMA endpoints and the original IP packet is
IPv4.[¶](#section-4-4){.pilcrow}

Header-based encapsulation [MUST]{.bcp14} be used if the trailer-based
method is not supported by either the client or Multi-Access Gateway. In
this case, if the adaptation layer, e.g., UDP tunneling, supports non-IP
packet format, non-IP encapsulation [MUST]{.bcp14} be used; otherwise,
header-based IP encapsulation [MUST]{.bcp14} be
used.[¶](#section-4-5){.pilcrow}

If non-IP encapsulation is configured, a GMA header [MUST]{.bcp14} be
present in every packet. In comparison, if IP encapsulation is
configured, a GMA header or trailer may be added dynamically on a
per-packet basis, and it indicates the presence of a GMA header (or
trailer) to set the protocol type of the GMA PDU to \"114\" (see
[Section 4.4](#sect-4.4){.xref}).[¶](#section-4-6){.pilcrow}

The GMA endpoints [MAY]{.bcp14} configure the GMA encapsulation method
through control signaling or pre-configuration. For example, the \"MX UP
Setup Configuration Request\" message as specified in Multi-Access
Management Service \[[MAMS](#RFC8743){.xref}\] includes \"MX Convergence
Method Parameters\", which provides the list of parameters to configure
the convergence layer, and can be extended to indicate the GMA
encapsulation method.[¶](#section-4-7){.pilcrow}

GMA endpoint [MUST]{.bcp14} discard a received packet and [MAY]{.bcp14}
log an error to report the situation (although such error logging
[MUST]{.bcp14} be subject to rate limits) under any of the following
conditions:[¶](#section-4-8){.pilcrow}

-   [The GMA version number in the GMA header (or trailer) is not
    understood or supported by the GMA
    endpoint.[¶](#section-4-9.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-4-9.1}
-   [A flag bit in the GMA header (or trailer) not understood or

As described in [Section 4.1](#sect-4.1){.xref}, IP-encapsulated GMA
PDUs are indicated using the IP protocol type 114. This is designated
and recorded by IANA \[[IANA](#IANA){.xref}\] to indicate \"any 0-Hop
Protocol\". No reference is given in the IANA registry for the
definition of this protocol type, and IANA has no record of why the
assignment was made or how it is used, although it was probably assigned
before 1999
\[[IANA1999](#IANA1999){.xref}\].[¶](#section-4.4-1){.pilcrow}

There is some risk associated with \"reusing\" protocol type 114 because
there may be implementations of other protocols also using this protocol
type. However, because the protocol described in this document is used
only between adjacent devices specifically configured for this purpose,
the use of protocol type 114 should be
safe.[¶](#section-4.4-2){.pilcrow}

As described in [Section 1.1](#sect-1.1){.xref}, one of the purposes of
the experiment described in this document is to verify the safety of
using this protocol type. Deployments should be aware of the risk of a
clash with other uses of this protocol
type.[¶](#section-4.4-3){.pilcrow}

If the MTU size of the anchor connection (for GMA SDU) is configured
such that the corresponding GMA PDU length adding the GMA header (or
trailer) and other overhead (UDP tunneling) [MAY]{.bcp14} exceed the MTU
of a delivery connection, GMA endpoints [MUST]{.bcp14} be configured to
support fragmentation through additional control messages
\[[MAMS](#RFC8743){.xref}\].[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

The fragmentation procedure at the convergence sublayer is similar to IP
fragmentation \[[RFC0791](#RFC0791){.xref}\] in principle, but with the
following two differences for less overhead:[¶](#section-5-2){.pilcrow}

-   [The fragment offset field is expressed in number of
    fragments.[¶](#section-5-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-5-3.1}
-   [The maximum number of fragments per SDU is 2^7^
    (=128).[¶](#section-5-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-5-3.2}

The Fragmentation Control (FC) field in the GMA trailer (or header)
contains the following bits:[¶](#section-5-4){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

Bit 7:
:   a More Fragment (MF) flag to indicate if the fragment is the last
    one (0) or not (1)[¶](#section-5-5.2){.pilcrow}
:   

Bit 0-6:
:   Fragment Offset (in units of fragments) to specify the offset of a
    particular fragment relative to the beginning of the
    SDU[¶](#section-5-5.4){.pilcrow}
:   

A PDU carries a whole SDU without fragmentation if the FC field is set
to all \"0\"s or the FC field is not present in the trailer. Otherwise,
the PDU contains a fragment of the SDU.[¶](#section-5-6){.pilcrow}

The Flow SN field in the trailer is used to distinguish the fragments of
one SDU from those of another. The Fragment Offset (FO) field tells the
receiver the position of a fragment in the original SDU. The More
Fragment (MF) flag indicates the last
fragment.[¶](#section-5-7){.pilcrow}

To fragment a long SDU, the transmitter creates n PDUs and copies the
content of the IP header fields from the long PDU into the IP header of
all the PDUs. The length field in the IP header of the PDU
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} be changed to the length of the PDU, and the protocol
type [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be changed to 114.[¶](#section-5-8){.pilcrow}

The data of the long SDU is divided into n portions based on the MTU
size of the delivery connection. The first portion of the data is placed
in the first PDU. The MF flag is set to \"1\", and the FO field is set
to \"0\". The i-th portion of the data is placed in the i-th PDU. The MF
flag is set to \"0\" if it is the last fragment and set to \"1\"
otherwise. The FO field is set to i-1.[¶](#section-5-9){.pilcrow}

To assemble the fragments of an SDU, the receiver combines PDUs that all
have the same Flow SN. The combination is done by placing the data
portion of each fragment in the relative order indicated by the Fragment
Offset in that fragment\'s GMA trailer (or header). The first fragment
will have the Fragment Offset set to \"0\", and the last fragment will
have the More Fragment flag set to \"0\".[¶](#section-5-10){.pilcrow}

GMA fragmentation operates above the IP layer of individual access
connection (Wi-Fi, LTE) and between the two endpoints of convergence
layer. The convergence layer endpoints (client, Multi-access Gateway)
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} obtain the MTU of individual connection through either
manual configuration or implementing Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD) as
suggested in \[[RFC8900](#RFC8900){.xref}\].[¶](#section-5-11){.pilcrow}

concatenated.[¶](#section-6-1){.pilcrow}

If the (trailer- or header-based) IP encapsulation method is used, the
First SDU Length (FSL) field [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be included in the GMA
trailer (or header) to indicate the length of the first SDU. Otherwise,

Concatenation and Trailer-Based IP

:::

To concatenate two or more SDUs, the transmitter creates one PDU and
copies the content of the IP header field from the first SDU into the IP
header of the PDU. The data of the first SDU is placed in the first
portion of the data of the PDU. The whole second SDU is then placed in
the second portion of the data of the PDU ([Figure 8](#Fig8){.xref}).
The procedure continues until the PDU size reaches the MTU of the
delivery connection. If the FSL field is present, the IP Length field of
the PDU [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be updated to include all concatenated SDUs and
the trailer (or header), and the IP checksum field [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be
recalculated if the packet is IPv4.[¶](#section-6-4){.pilcrow}

To disaggregate a PDU, if the (header- or trailer-based) IP
encapsulation method is used, the receiver first obtains the length of
the first SDU from the FSL field and decodes the first SDU. The receiver
then obtains the length of the second SDU based on the length field in
the second SDU IP header and decodes the second SDU. The procedure
continues until no byte is left in the PDU. If the non-IP encapsulation
method ([Figure 7](#Fig7){.xref}) is used, the IP header of the first
SDU will not change during the encapsulation process, and the receiver
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} obtain the length of the first SDU directly from its IP
header ([Figure 9](#Fig9){.xref}).[¶](#section-6-5){.pilcrow}

If a PDU contains multiple SDUs, the Flow SN field is for the last SDU,

a PDU contains 3 SDUs (IP packets), the SN is 4, 5, and 6 for the first,

GMA concatenation can be used for packing small packets of a single
application, e.g., TCP ACKs, or from multiple applications. Notice that
a single GMA flow may carry multiple application flows (TCP, UDP,

Security in a network using GMA should be relatively similar to security
in a normal IP network. GMA is unaware of IP- or higher-layer end-to-end
security as it carries the IP packets as opaque payload. Deployers are
encouraged to not consider that GMA adds any form of security and to
continue to use IP- or higher-layer security as well as link-layer
security.[¶](#section-7-1){.pilcrow}

The GMA protocol at the convergence sublayer is a 0-hop protocol and
relies on the security of the underlying network transport paths. When
this cannot be assumed, appropriate security protocols (IPsec, DTLS,
etc.) [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be configured at the adaptation sublayer. On the
other hand, packet filtering requires either that a firewall looks
inside the GMA packet or that the filtering is done on the GMA
endpoints. In those environments in which this is considered to be a
security issue, it may be desirable to terminate the GMA operation at
the firewall.[¶](#section-7-2){.pilcrow}

Local-only packet leak prevention (HL=0, TTL=1) [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be on
preventing the leak of the local-only GMA PDUs outside the \"local
domain\" to the Internet or to another domain that could use the same IP
protocol type, i.e., 114.[¶](#section-7-3){.pilcrow}
