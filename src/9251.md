# Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) and Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) Proxies for Ethernet VPN (EVPN) {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

This document describes how to support endpoints running the Internet
Group Management Protocol (IGMP) or Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD)
efficiently for the multicast services over an Ethernet VPN (EVPN)
network by incorporating IGMP/MLD Proxy procedures on EVPN Provider
Edges (PEs).[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

## [1.](#section-1){.section-number .selfRef} [Introduction](#name-introduction){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-introduction}

In data center (DC) applications, a point of delivery (POD) can consist
of a collection of servers supported by several top-of-rack (ToR) and
spine switches. This collection of servers and switches are
self-contained and may have their own control protocol for intra-POD
communication and orchestration. However, EVPN is used as a standard way
of inter-POD communication for both intra-DC and inter-DC. A subnet can
span across multiple PODs and DCs. EVPN provides a robust multi-tenant
solution with extensive multihoming capabilities to stretch a subnet
(VLAN) across multiple PODs and DCs. There can be many hosts (several
hundreds) attached to a subnet that is stretched across several PODs and
DCs.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

These hosts express their interests in multicast groups on a given
subnet/VLAN by sending IGMP/MLD Membership Reports for their interested
multicast group(s). Furthermore, an IGMP/MLD router periodically sends
Membership Queries to find out if there are hosts on that subnet that
are still interested in receiving multicast traffic for that group. The
IGMP/MLD Proxy solution described in this document accomplishes three
objectives:[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

1.  [Reduce flooding of IGMP/MLD messages: Just like the ARP/Neighbor
    Discovery (ND) suppression mechanism in EVPN to reduce the flooding
    of ARP messages over EVPN, it is also desired to have a mechanism to
    reduce the flooding of IGMP/MLD messages (both Queries and
    Membership Reports) in
    EVPN.[¶](#section-1-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-3.1}
2.  [Distributed anycast multicast proxy: It is desirable for the EVPN
    network to act as a distributed anycast multicast router with
    respect to IGMP/MLD Proxy function for all the hosts attached to
    that subnet.[¶](#section-1-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-3.2}
3.  [Selective multicast: This describes forwarding multicast traffic
    over the EVPN network such that it only gets forwarded to the PEs
    that have interests in the multicast group(s). This document shows
    how this objective may be achieved when ingress replication is used
    to distribute the multicast traffic among the PEs. Procedures for
    supporting selective multicast using Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP)
    tunnels can be found in
    \[[EVPN-BUM](#I-D.ietf-bess-evpn-bum-procedure-updates){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-3.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-3.3}

The first two objectives are achieved by using the IGMP/MLD Proxy on the
PE. The third objective is achieved by setting up a multicast tunnel
among only the PEs that have interest in the multicast group(s) based on
the trigger from IGMP/MLD Proxy processes. The proposed solutions for
each of these objectives are discussed in the following
sections.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC2236](#RFC2236){.xref}\]. When this document uses the term \"IGMP
Membership Report\", the text equally applies to the MLD Membership
Report. Similarly, text for IGMPv2 applies to MLDv1, and text for IGMPv3
applies to MLDv2. IGMP/MLD version encoding in the BGP update is stated
in [Section 9](#bgp-encoding){.xref}.[¶](#section-3-2){.pilcrow}

It is important to note that when there is text considering whether a PE
indicates support for IGMP proxying, the corresponding behavior has a
natural analog for indicating support for MLD proxying, and the
analogous requirements apply as well.[¶](#section-3-3){.pilcrow}

## [4.](#section-4){.section-number .selfRef} [IGMP/MLD Proxy](#name-igmp-mld-proxy){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-igmp-mld-proxy}

The IGMP Proxy mechanism is used to reduce the flooding of IGMP messages
over an EVPN network, similar to the ARP proxy used in reducing the
flooding of ARP messages over EVPN. It also provides a triggering
mechanism for the PEs to set up their underlay multicast tunnels. The
IGMP Proxy mechanism consists of two
components:[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

1.  [Proxy for IGMP Membership
    Reports[¶](#section-4-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-4-2.1}
2.  [Proxy for IGMP Membership
    Queries[¶](#section-4-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-4-2.2}

The goal of IGMP and MLD proxying is to make the EVPN behave seamlessly
for the tenant systems with respect to multicast operations while using
a more efficient delivery system for signaling and delivery across the
VPN. Accordingly, group state must be tracked synchronously among the
PEs serving the VPN, with join and leave events propagated to the peer
PEs and each PE tracking the state of each of its peer PEs with respect
to whether there are locally attached group members (and in some cases,
senders), what version(s) of IGMP/MLD are in use for those locally
attached group members, etc. In order to perform this translation, each
PE acts as an IGMP router for the locally attached domain, maintains the
requisite state on locally attached nodes, sends periodic Membership
Queries, etc. The role of EVPN Selective Multicast Ethernet Tag (SMET)
route propagation is to ensure that each PE\'s local state is propagated
to the other PEs so that they share a consistent view of the overall
IGMP Membership Request and Leave Group state. It is important to note
that the need to keep such local state can be triggered by either local
IGMP traffic or BGP EVPN signaling. In most cases, a local IGMP event
will need to be signaled over EVPN, though state initiated by received
EVPN traffic will not always need to be relayed to the locally attached
domain.[¶](#section-4-3){.pilcrow}

### [4.1.](#section-4.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Proxy Reporting](#name-proxy-reporting){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-proxy-reporting}

When IGMP is used between hosts and their first hop EVPN router (EVPN
PE), proxy reporting is used by the EVPN PE to summarize (when possible)
reports received from downstream hosts and propagate them in BGP to
other PEs that are interested in the information. This is done by
terminating the IGMP Membership Reports in the first hop PE and
translating and exchanging the relevant information among EVPN BGP
speakers. The information is again translated back to an IGMP message at
the recipient EVPN speaker. Thus, it helps create an IGMP overlay subnet
using BGP. In order to facilitate such an overlay, this document also
defines a new EVPN route type Network Layer Reachability Information
(NLRI) and the EVPN SMET route, along with its procedures to help
exchange and register IGMP multicast groups; see [Section
9](#bgp-encoding){.xref}.[¶](#section-4.1-1){.pilcrow}

When a PE wants to advertise an IGMP Membership Report using the BGP
EVPN route, it follows the proceeding rules (BGP encoding is stated in
[Section 9](#bgp-encoding){.xref}). The first four rules are applicable
to the originator PE, and the last three rules are applicable to remote
PE processing SMET routes:[¶](#section-4.1.1-1){.pilcrow}

Processing at the BGP route originator:[¶](#section-4.1.1-2){.pilcrow}

1.  [When the first hop PE receives IGMP Membership Reports belonging to
    the same IGMP version from different attached hosts for the same
    (\*,G) or (S,G), it [SHOULD]{.bcp14} send a single BGP message
    corresponding to the very first IGMP Membership Request (BGP update
    as soon as possible) for that (\*,G) or (S,G). This is because BGP
    is a stateful protocol, and no further transmission of the same
    report is needed. If the IGMP Membership Request is for (\*,G), then
    the Multicast Group Address [MUST]{.bcp14} be sent along with the
    corresponding version flag (v2 or v3) set. In case of IGMPv3, the
    exclude flag [MUST]{.bcp14} also be set to indicate that no source
    IP address must be excluded (include all sources \"\*\"). If the
    IGMP Membership Report is for (S,G), then besides setting the
    Multicast Group Address along with the v3 flag, the source IP
    address and the Include/Exclude (IE) flag [MUST]{.bcp14} be set. It
    should be noted that, when advertising the EVPN route for (S,G), the
    only valid version flag is v3 (v2 flags [MUST]{.bcp14} be set to
    0).[¶](#section-4.1.1-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.1.1-3.1}
2.  [When the first hop PE receives an IGMPv3 Membership Report for
    (S,G) on a given BD, it [MUST]{.bcp14} advertise the corresponding
    EVPN SMET route, regardless of whether the source (S) is attached to
    itself or not, in order to facilitate the source move in the
    future.[¶](#section-4.1.1-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.1.1-3.2}
3.  [When the first hop PE receives an IGMP version-X Membership Report
    first for (\*,G) and then later receives an IGMP version-Y
    Membership Report for the same (\*,G), then it [MUST]{.bcp14}
    re-advertise the same EVPN SMET route with the flag for version-Y
    set in addition to any previously set version flag(s). In other
    words, the first hop PE [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} withdraw the EVPN route
    before sending the new route because the Flags field is not part of
    BGP route key
    processing.[¶](#section-4.1.1-3.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.1.1-3.3}

    first for (\*,G) and then later receives an IGMPv3 Membership Report
    for the same Multicast Group Address but for a specific source
    address S, then the PE [MUST]{.bcp14} advertise a new EVPN SMET
    route with the v3 flag set (and v2 reset). The IE flag also needs to
    be set accordingly. Since the source IP address is used as part of
    BGP route key processing, it is considered to be a new BGP route
    advertisement. When different versions of IGMP Membership Report are
    received, the final state [MUST]{.bcp14} be as per [Section

1.  [When a PE receives an EVPN SMET route with more than one version
    flag set, it will generate the corresponding IGMP Report for (\*,G)
    for each version specified in the Flags field. With multiple version
    flags set, there must not be a source IP address in the received
    EVPN route. If there is, then an error [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be logged.
    If the v3 flag is set (in addition to v2), then the IE flag
    [MUST]{.bcp14} indicate \"exclude\". If not, then an error
    [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be logged. The PE [MUST]{.bcp14} generate an IGMP
    Membership Report for that (\*,G) and each IGMP version in the
    version flag.[¶](#section-4.1.1-5.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.1.1-5.1}
2.  [When a PE receives a list of EVPN SMET NLRIs in its BGP update
    message, each with a different source IP address and the same
    Multicast Group Address, and the version flag is set to v3, then the
    PE generates an IGMPv3 Membership Report with a record corresponding
    to the list of source IP addresses and the group address, along with
    the proper indication of
    inclusion/exclusion.[¶](#section-4.1.1-5.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.1.1-5.2}
3.  [Upon receiving an EVPN SMET route(s) and before generating the
    corresponding IGMP Membership Request(s), the PE checks to see
    whether it has a Customer Edge (CE) multicast router for that BD on
    any of its ESs . The PE provides such a check by listening for PIM
    Hello messages on that AC, i.e., (ES,BD). If the PE does have the
    router\'s ACs, then the generated IGMP Membership Request(s) is sent
    to those ACs. If it doesn\'t have any of the router\'s ACs, then no
    IGMP Membership Request(s) needs to be generated. This is because
    sending IGMP Membership Requests to other hosts can result in
    unintentionally preventing a host from joining a specific multicast
    group using IGMPv2, i.e., if the PE does not receive a Membership
    Report from the host, it will not forward multicast data to it. Per
    \[[RFC4541](#RFC4541){.xref}\] , when an IGMPv2 host receives a
    Membership Report for a group address that it intends to join, the
    host will suppress its own Membership Report for the same group, and
    if the PE does not receive an IGMP Membership Report from the host,
    it will not forward multicast data to it. In other words, an IGMPv2
    Membership Report [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be sent on an AC that does not
    lead to a CE multicast router. This message suppression is a
    requirement for IGMPv2 hosts. This is not a problem for hosts
    running IGMPv3, because there is no suppression of IGMP Membership
    Reports.[¶](#section-4.1.1-5.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.1.1-5.3}

When PE1 receives an IGMPv2 Membership Report from H1, it does not
forward this Membership Report to any of its other ports (for this
subnet) because all these local ports are associated with the hosts. PE1
sends an EVPN SMET route corresponding to this Membership Report for

PE3, which are the members of the same BD (i.e., same EVI in case of a
VLAN-based service or EVI and VLAN in case of a VLAN-aware bundle
service). PE3 reconstructs the IGMPv2 Membership Report from this EVPN
BGP route and only sends it to the port(s) with multicast routers
attached to it (for that subnet). In this example, PE3 sends the
reconstructed IGMPv2 Membership Report for (\*,G1) only to R1.
Furthermore, even though PE2 receives the EVPN BGP route, it does not
send it to any of its ports for that subnet (viz., ports associated with
H6 and H7).[¶](#section-5.1-1){.pilcrow}

capability using this extended community, but it does not advertise any
SMET route for that (x,G). When the source PE (ingress PE) receives such
advertisements from the egress PE, it does not replicate the multicast

In EVPN, every EVI is associated with one or more Route Targets. These
RTs serve two functions:[¶](#section-9.5-1){.pilcrow}

1.  [Distribution control: RTs control the distribution of the routes.
    If a route carries the RT associated with a particular EVI, it will
    be distributed to all the PEs on which that EVI
    exists.[¶](#section-9.5-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-9.5-2.1}

    PE, the RT is used to identify the EVI to which it
    applies.[¶](#section-9.5-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-9.5-2.2}

An IGMP Membership Report Synch or IGMP Leave Synch route is associated
with a particular combination of ES and EVI. These routes need to be
distributed only to PEs that are attached to the associated ES.
Therefore, these routes carry the ES-Import RT for that
ES.[¶](#section-9.5-3){.pilcrow}

Since an IGMP Membership Report Synch or IGMP Leave Synch route does not
need to be distributed to all the PEs on which the associated EVI
exists, these routes cannot carry the RT associated with that EVI.
Therefore, when such a route arrives at a particular PE, the route\'s
RTs cannot be used to identify the EVI to which the route applies. Some
other means of associating the route with an EVI must be
used.[¶](#section-9.5-4){.pilcrow}

This document specifies four new ECs that can be used to identify the
EVI with which a route is associated but do not have any effect on the
distribution of the route. These new ECs are known as \"Type 0 EVI-RT
EC\", \"Type 1 EVI-RT EC\", \"Type 2 EVI-RT EC\", and \"Type 3 EVI-RT

There are certain situations in which an ES is attached to a set of PEs
that are not all in the same AS, or not all operated by the same
provider. In this situation, the RT that corresponds to a particular EVI
may be different in each AS. If a route is propagated from AS1 to AS2,
an ASBR at the AS1/AS2 border may be configured with a policy that
replaces the EVI RTs for AS1 with the corresponding EVI RTs for AS2.
This is known as RT-rewriting.[¶](#section-9.6-1){.pilcrow}

If an ASBR is configured to perform RT-rewriting of the EVI RTs in EVPN
routes, it [MUST]{.bcp14} be configured to perform RT-rewriting of the
corresponding EVI-RT extended communities in IGMP Join Synch and IGMP
