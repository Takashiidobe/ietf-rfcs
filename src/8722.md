# RFC 8722 {#rfcnum}

# Defining the Role and Function of IETF Protocol Parameter Registry Operators {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

Many Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) protocols make use of
commonly defined values that are passed in messages or packets. To
ensure consistent interpretation of these values between independent
implementations, there is a need to ensure that the values and
associated semantic intent are uniquely defined. The IETF uses registry
functions to record assigned protocol parameter values and their
associated semantic intentions. For each IETF protocol parameter, it is
current practice for the IETF to delegate the role of Protocol Parameter
Registry Operator to a nominated entity. This document provides a
description of, and the requirements for, these delegated functions.
This document obsoletes RFC 6220 to replace all references to the IETF
Administrative Support Activity (IASA) and related structures with those
defined by the IASA 2.0 Model.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

Many IETF protocols make use of commonly defined values that are passed
within messages or packets. To ensure consistent interpretation of these
values between independent implementations, there is a need to ensure
that the values and associated semantic intent are uniquely defined. The
IETF uses registries to record each of the possible values of a protocol
parameter and their associated semantic intent. These registries, their
registration policy, and the layout of their content are defined in the
so-called \"IANA Considerations\" sections of IETF
documents.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

The organizational separation between the IETF and its Protocol
Parameter Registry Operators parallels ones that are fairly common among
standards development organizations (SDOs) although less common among
technology consortia and similar bodies. These functions have been
separated into different organizations for several reasons. They include
dealing with administrative issues, addressing concerns about
maintaining an adequate distance between basic policy and specific
allocations, and avoiding any potential conflicts of interest that might
arise from commercial or organizational relationships. For example, most
ISO and ISO/IEC JTC1 standards that require registration activities
specify a Registration Authority (RA) or Maintenance Agency (MA) that,
in turn, control the actual registration decisions. The databases of
what is registered for each standard may then be maintained by a
secretariat or database function associated with the RA or MA or, less
frequently, by the secretariat of the body that created and maintains
the standard itself.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

This structural separation of roles exists within several places in the
IETF framework (e.g., the RFC Editor function). The Internet
Architecture Board (IAB), on behalf of the IETF, has the responsibility
to define and manage the relationship with the Protocol Parameter
Registry Operator role. This responsibility includes the selection and
management of the Protocol Parameter Registry Operator, as well as
management of the parameter registration process and the guidelines for
parameter allocation.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

As with other SDOs, although it may delegate authority for some specific
decisions, the IETF asserts authority and responsibility for the
management of all of its protocol parameters and their registries, even
while it generally remains isolated from the selection of particular
values once a registration is approved. This document describes the
function of these registries as they apply to individual protocol
parameters defined by the IETF Internet Standards Process (see RFC 6410
\[[BCP9](#BCP9){.xref}\]) to allow for an orderly implementation by the
IETF Administration Limited Liability Company (IETF LLC), and others as
needed, under guidance from the IAB. This document obsoletes RFC 6220 to
replace all references to the IASA and related structures with those
defined by the IASA 2.0 Model
\[[RFC8711](#RFC8711){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

Below we provide a description of the requirements for these delegated
functions, which the IETF traditionally refers to as the Internet
Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) function.[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}
:::

::: {#section-2 .section}
## [2.](#section-2){.section-number .selfRef} [Roles and Responsibilities Concerning IETF Protocol Parameter Registries](#name-roles-and-responsibilities-){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-roles-and-responsibilities-}

The IETF\'s longstanding practice is to outsource the management and
implementation of some important functions (e.g.,
\[[RFC8728](#RFC8728){.xref}\]). The protocol parameter registry
function falls into this category of outsourced functions, and what
follows here is the description of the roles and responsibilities with
respect to the registration of IETF protocol
parameters.[¶](#section-2-1){.pilcrow}

Specifically, this document describes the operation and role of a
delegated IETF Protocol Parameter Registry Operator, to be selected and
administered by the IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA)
\[[RFC8711](#RFC8711){.xref}\]. While there is generally a single
Protocol Parameter Registry Operator, additional Operators may be
selected to implement specific registries, and that has been done
occasionally. Having a single Protocol Parameter Registry Operator
facilitates coordination among registries, even those that are not
obviously related, and also makes it easier to have consistency of
formats and registry structure, which aids users of the registries and
assists with quality control.[¶](#section-2-2){.pilcrow}

Many protocols make use of identifiers consisting of constants and other
well-known values. Even after a protocol has been defined and deployment
has begun, new values may need to be assigned (e.g., for a new option
type in DHCP, or a new encryption or authentication algorithm for
IPsec). To ensure that such quantities have consistent values and
interpretations in different implementations, their assignment must be
administered by a central authority. For IETF protocols, that role is
provided by a delegated Protocol Parameter Registry Operator. For any
particular protocol parameter there is a single delegated Registry
Operator.[¶](#section-2-3){.pilcrow}

The IETF Protocol Parameter Registry function is undertaken under the
auspices of the Internet Architecture

The roles of the Protocol Parameter Registry Operator (Registry
Operator) are as follows:[¶](#section-2.1-2){.pilcrow}

        Group (IESG), with the objective of offering advice to the IESG
        regarding the contents of the \"IANA Considerations\" section,
        whether such a section, when required, is clear in terms of
        direction to the Registry Operator, and whether the section is
        consistent with the current published Registry Operator
        guidelines.[¶](#section-2.1-3.1.2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.1-3.1.2.1}

    -   ::: {#section-2.1-3.2.2.2}
        The delegated Registry Operator registers values for Internet
        protocol parameters only as directed by the criteria and
        procedures specified in RFCs, including Standards Track
        documents \[[BCP9](#BCP9){.xref}\], Best Current Practice
        documents, and other RFCs that require protocol parameter
        assignment.[¶](#section-2.1-3.2.2.2.1){.pilcrow}

        If values for Internet protocol parameters were not specified,
        or in case of ambiguity, the Registry Operator will continue to
        assign and register only those protocol parameters that have
        already been delegated to the Registry Operator, following past
        and current practice for such assignments, unless otherwise
        directed in terms of operating practice by the IESG. In the case
        of ambiguity, the Registry Operator is expected to identify the
        ambiguity to the IAB or IESG as appropriate and either suggest
        better text or ask the appropriate parties for
        clarification.[¶](#section-2.1-3.2.2.2.2){.pilcrow}

### [2.2.](#section-2.2){.section-number .selfRef} [IAB Role](#name-iab-role){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-iab-role}

An Operator of an IETF protocol parameter registry undertakes the role
as a delegated function under the authority of the
IAB.[¶](#section-2.2-1){.pilcrow}

The IAB has the responsibility to review the current description of the
registry function from time to time and direct the Registry Operator to
adopt amendments relating to its role and mode of operation according to
the best interests of the IETF and the Internet community in
general.[¶](#section-2.2-2){.pilcrow}

The IAB has the responsibility to appoint an organization to undertake
the delegated functions of the Registry Operator for each IETF protocol
parameter. Specifically, the IAB defines the role and requirements for
the desired functions. The IETF LLC is responsible for identifying a
potential vendor, and once under agreement, managing the various aspects
of the relationships with that vendor. To be clear, the IAB is in the
deciding role (e.g., for appointment and termination), but must work in
close consultation with the IETF LLC.[¶](#section-2.2-3){.pilcrow}

The IAB has the responsibility to determine the terms and conditions of
this delegated role. Such terms and conditions should ensure that the
registry operates in a manner that is fully conformant to the functions
described in this document. In addition, such terms and conditions must
not restrict the rights and interests of the IETF with respect to the
registry contents and maintenance.[¶](#section-2.2-4){.pilcrow}

into IETF protocol parameter registries and maintaining the policies by
which such technical directions are given. Technical direction itself is
provided through the adoption of directives within the \"IANA
Considerations\" section of IETF Stream RFCs or through stand-alone
\"IANA Considerations\" RFCs.[¶](#section-2.3-1){.pilcrow}

The IESG shall verify that Internet-Drafts that are offered for
publication as IETF Stream RFCs \[[RFC8729](#RFC8729){.xref}\] include
\"IANA Considerations\" sections when needed, and that \"IANA
Considerations\" sections conform to the current published
guidelines.[¶](#section-2.3-2){.pilcrow}

Since technical assessment is not generally a responsibility of the
Registry Operator, as part of providing the technical direction the IESG
is responsible for identifying the technical experts that are required
to, where appropriate, review registration requests or resolve open
technical questions that relate to the registration of
parameters.[¶](#section-2.3-3){.pilcrow}

### [2.5.](#section-2.5){.section-number .selfRef} [Role of the IETF Administration Limited Liability Company](#name-role-of-the-ietf-administra){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-role-of-the-ietf-administra}

The IETF Administration Limited Liability Company (IETF LLC)
\[[RFC8711](#RFC8711){.xref}\] is responsible for identifying a
potential vendor in a manner of its choosing, based on IAB consultation,
and for managing the various aspects of the relationships with that
vendor.[¶](#section-2.5-1){.pilcrow}

In addition, the IETF LLC has the responsibility to ensure long-term
access, stability, and uniqueness across all such registries. This
responsibility is of particular significance in the event that a
relation with a Protocol Parameter Registry Operator is
terminated.[¶](#section-2.5-2){.pilcrow}

## [3.](#section-3){.section-number .selfRef} [Miscellaneous Considerations](#name-miscellaneous-consideration){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-miscellaneous-consideration}

While this document has focused on the creation of protocols by the
IETF, the requirements provided are generically applicable to the
extended IETF community as well (e.g., Internet Research Task Force
(IRTF)).[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

The IESG is responsible for the technical direction of the IETF protocol
parameter registries and maintaining the policies by which such
technical directions are given. The IESG is responsible, as part of the
document approval process associated with the IETF Stream RFCs
\[[RFC8729](#RFC8729){.xref}\], for \"IANA Considerations\"
verification. For the other RFC streams, the approval bodies are
responsible for verifying that the documents include \"IANA
Considerations\" sections when needed, and that \"IANA Considerations\"
sections conform to the current published guidelines. In the case that
IANA considerations in non-IETF document streams lead to a dispute, the
IAB makes the final decision.[¶](#section-3-2){.pilcrow}

This document talks about \"Registry Operator\" (singular), and while
there are stability and economy-of-scale advantages for one single
Registry Operator, this document does not exclude having different
Registry Operators for different protocol registries when justified by
the circumstances.[¶](#section-3-3){.pilcrow}

any new security considerations.[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

## [5.](#section-5){.section-number .selfRef} [IANA Considerations](#name-iana-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-iana-considerations}

This document requires no direct IANA actions in terms of the creation
or operation of a protocol parameter registry. However, this document
does define the roles and responsibilities of various bodies who are
responsible for, and associated with, the operation of protocol
parameter registration functions for the
IETF.[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}
