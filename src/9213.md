# RFC 9213 {#rfcnum}

# Targeted HTTP Cache Control {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

This specification defines a convention for HTTP response header fields
that allow cache directives to be targeted at specific caches or classes
of caches. It also defines one such header field, the CDN-Cache-Control
response header field, which is targeted at content delivery network
(CDN) caches.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

## [1.](#section-1){.section-number .selfRef} [Introduction](#name-introduction){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-introduction}

Modern deployments of HTTP often use multiple layers of caching. For
example, a website might use a cache on the origin server itself; it
might deploy a caching layer in the same network as the origin server,
it might use one or more CDNs that are distributed throughout the
Internet, and it might benefit from browser caching as
well.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

Because it is often desirable to control these different classes of
caches separately, some means of targeting cache directives at them is
necessary. For example, if a publisher has a mechanism to invalidate the
contents of a cache that it has a relationship with (such as a CDN
cache), they might be more comfortable assigning a more generous caching
policy to it while still wanting to restrict the behavior of other
caches.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

The HTTP Cache-Control response header field (defined in [Section
5.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111#section-5.2){.relref} of
\[[HTTP-CACHING](#HTTP-CACHING){.xref}\]) is widely used to direct
caching behavior. However, it is relatively undifferentiated; while some
cache directives (e.g., s-maxage) are targeted at a specific class of
caches (for s-maxage, shared caches), targeting is not consistently
available across all existing cache directives (e.g.,
stale-while-revalidate). This is problematic especially as the number of
caching extensions grows along with the number of potential
targets.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

Some implementations have defined ad hoc control mechanisms to overcome
this issue, but their interoperability is low. [Section
2](#targeted){.xref} defines a standard framework for targeted cache
control using HTTP response headers, and [Section
3](#cdn-cache-control){.xref} defines one such header: the
CDN-Cache-Control response header field.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

## [2.](#section-2){.section-number .selfRef} [Targeted Cache-Control Header Fields](#name-targeted-cache-control-head){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-targeted-cache-control-head}

A Targeted Cache-Control Header Field (hereafter \"targeted field\") is
an HTTP response header field that has the same semantics as the
Cache-Control response header field
(\[[HTTP-CACHING](#HTTP-CACHING){.xref}\], [Section
5.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111#section-5.2){.relref}).
However, it has a distinct field name that indicates the target for its
cache directives.[¶](#section-2-1){.pilcrow}

For example:[¶](#section-2-2){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-2-3}
``` {.lang-http-message .sourcecode}
CDN-Cache-Control: max-age=60
```

[¶](#section-2-3){.pilcrow}
:::

is a targeted field that applies to CDNs, as defined in [Section
3](#cdn-cache-control){.xref}.[¶](#section-2-4){.pilcrow}

::: {#syntax}
::: {#section-2.1 .section}
### [2.1.](#section-2.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Syntax](#name-syntax){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-syntax}

Targeted fields are Dictionary Structured Fields ([Section
3.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8941#section-3.2){.relref} of
\[[STRUCTURED-FIELDS](#RFC8941){.xref}\]). Each member of the Dictionary
is an HTTP cache response directive ([Section
5.2.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111#section-5.2.2){.relref} of
\[[HTTP-CACHING](#HTTP-CACHING){.xref}\]) including extension response
directives (as per [Section
5.2.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111#section-5.2.3){.relref} of
\[[HTTP-CACHING](#HTTP-CACHING){.xref}\]). Note that while targeted
fields often have the same syntax as Cache-Control fields, differences
in error handling mean that using a Cache-Control parser rather than a
Structured Fields parser can introduce interoperability
issues.[¶](#section-2.1-1){.pilcrow}

Because cache directives are not defined in terms of structured data
types, it is necessary to map their values into the appropriate types.
[Section
5.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111#section-5.2){.relref} of
\[[HTTP-CACHING](#HTTP-CACHING){.xref}\] defines cache directive values
to be either absent, a quoted-string, or a
token.[¶](#section-2.1-2){.pilcrow}

This means that cache directives that have no value will be mapped to a
Boolean ([Section
3.3.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8941#section-3.3.6){.relref} of
\[[STRUCTURED-FIELDS](#RFC8941){.xref}\]). When the value is a
quoted-string, it will be mapped to a String ([Section
3.3.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8941#section-3.3.3){.relref} of
\[[STRUCTURED-FIELDS](#RFC8941){.xref}\]), and when it is a token, it
will map to a Token ([Section
3.3.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8941#section-3.3.4){.relref} of
\[[STRUCTURED-FIELDS](#RFC8941){.xref}\]), an Integer ([Section
3.3.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8941#section-3.3.1){.relref} of
\[[STRUCTURED-FIELDS](#RFC8941){.xref}\]), or a Decimal ([Section
3.3.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8941#section-3.3.2){.relref} of
\[[STRUCTURED-FIELDS](#RFC8941){.xref}\]), depending on the content of
the value.[¶](#section-2.1-3){.pilcrow}

For example, the max-age directive ([Section
5.2.2.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111#section-5.2.2.1){.relref}
of \[[HTTP-CACHING](#HTTP-CACHING){.xref}\]) has an integer value;
no-store ([Section
5.2.2.5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111#section-5.2.2.5){.relref}
of \[[HTTP-CACHING](#HTTP-CACHING){.xref}\]) always has a Boolean true
value, and no-cache ([Section
5.2.2.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111#section-5.2.2.4){.relref}
of \[[HTTP-CACHING](#HTTP-CACHING){.xref}\]) has a value that can be
either Boolean true or a string containing a comma-delimited list of
field names.[¶](#section-2.1-4){.pilcrow}

Implementations [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} generate values that violate these
inferred constraints on the cache directive\'s value. In particular,
string values whose first character is not alphabetic or \"\*\"
[MUST]{.bcp14} be generated as Strings so that they are not mistaken for
other types.[¶](#section-2.1-5){.pilcrow}

Implementations [SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} consume values that violate these
inferred constraints. For example, a consuming implementation that
coerces a max-age with a decimal value into an integer would behave
differently than other implementations, potentially causing
interoperability issues.[¶](#section-2.1-6){.pilcrow}

Parameters received on cache directives are to be ignored, unless other
handling is explicitly specified.[¶](#section-2.1-7){.pilcrow}

If a targeted field in a given response is empty, or a parsing error is
encountered, that field [MUST]{.bcp14} be ignored by the cache (i.e., it
behaves as if the field were not present, likely falling back to other
cache-control mechanisms present).[¶](#section-2.1-8){.pilcrow}
:::
:::

::: {#cache-behavior}
::: {#section-2.2 .section}
### [2.2.](#section-2.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Cache Behavior](#name-cache-behavior){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-cache-behavior}

A cache that implements this specification maintains a target list. A
target list is an ordered list of the targeted field names that it uses
for caching policy, with the order reflecting priority from most
applicable to least. The target list might be fixed, user configurable,
or generated per request, depending upon the
implementation.[¶](#section-2.2-1){.pilcrow}

For example, a CDN cache might support both CDN-Cache-Control and a
header specific to that CDN, ExampleCDN-Cache-Control, with the latter
overriding the former. Its target list would
be:[¶](#section-2.2-2){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-2.2-3 .alignLeft .art-text .artwork}
      [ExampleCDN-Cache-Control, CDN-Cache-Control]

[¶](#section-2.2-3){.pilcrow}
:::

When a cache that implements this specification receives a response with
one or more of the header field names on its target list, the cache
[MUST]{.bcp14} select the first (in target-list order) field with a
valid, non-empty value and use its value to determine the caching policy
for the response, and it [MUST]{.bcp14} ignore the Cache-Control and
Expires header fields in that response, unless no valid, non-empty value
is available from the listed header fields.[¶](#section-2.2-4){.pilcrow}

Note that this occurs on a response-by-response basis; if no member of
the cache\'s target list is present, valid, and non-empty, a cache falls
back to other cache control mechanisms as required by HTTP
\[[HTTP-CACHING](#HTTP-CACHING){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2.2-5){.pilcrow}

Targeted fields that are not on a cache\'s target list [MUST
NOT]{.bcp14} change that cache\'s behavior and [MUST]{.bcp14} be passed
through.[¶](#section-2.2-6){.pilcrow}

Caches that use a targeted field [MUST]{.bcp14} implement the semantics
of the following cache directives:[¶](#section-2.2-7){.pilcrow}

-   [max-age[¶](#section-2.2-8.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.2-8.1}
-   [must-revalidate[¶](#section-2.2-8.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.2-8.2}
-   [no-store[¶](#section-2.2-8.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.2-8.3}
-   [no-cache[¶](#section-2.2-8.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.2-8.4}
-   [private[¶](#section-2.2-8.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.2-8.5}

Furthermore, they [SHOULD]{.bcp14} implement other cache directives
(including extension cache directives) that they support in the
Cache-Control response header field.[¶](#section-2.2-9){.pilcrow}

The semantics and precedence of cache directives in a targeted field are
the same as those in Cache-Control. In particular, no-store and no-cache
make max-age inoperative, and unrecognized extension directives are
ignored.[¶](#section-2.2-10){.pilcrow}
:::

::: {#interaction-with-http-freshness}
::: {#section-2.3 .section}
### [2.3.](#section-2.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Interaction with HTTP Freshness](#name-interaction-with-http-fresh){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-interaction-with-http-fresh}

HTTP caching has a single, end-to-end freshness model defined in
[Section
4.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111#section-4.2){.relref} of
\[[HTTP-CACHING](#HTTP-CACHING){.xref}\]. When additional freshness
mechanisms are only available to some caches along a request path (for
example, using targeted fields), their interactions need to be carefully
considered. In particular, a targeted cache might have longer freshness
lifetimes available to it than other caches, causing it to serve
responses that appear to be prematurely (or even immediately) stale to
those other caches, negatively impacting cache
efficiency.[¶](#section-2.3-1){.pilcrow}

For example, a response stored by a CDN cache might be served with the
following headers:[¶](#section-2.3-2){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-2.3-3}
``` {.lang-http-message .sourcecode}
Age: 1800
Cache-Control: max-age=600
CDN-Cache-Control: max-age=3600
```

[¶](#section-2.3-3){.pilcrow}
:::

From the CDN\'s perspective, this response is still fresh after being
cached for 30 minutes, while from the standpoint of other caches, this
response is already stale. See \[[AGE-PENALTY](#AGE-PENALTY){.xref}\]
for more discussion.[¶](#section-2.3-4){.pilcrow}

When the targeted cache has a strong coherence mechanism (e.g., the
origin server has the ability to proactively invalidate cached
responses), it is often desirable to mitigate these effects. Some
techniques seen in deployments include:[¶](#section-2.3-5){.pilcrow}

-   [Removing the Age header
    field[¶](#section-2.3-6.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.3-6.1}
-   [Updating the Date header field value to the current
    time[¶](#section-2.3-6.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.3-6.2}
-   [Updating the Expires header field value to the current time, plus
    any Cache-Control: max-age
    value[¶](#section-2.3-6.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.3-6.3}

This specification does not place any specific requirements on
implementations to mitigate these effects, but definitions of targeted
fields can do so.[¶](#section-2.3-7){.pilcrow}
:::

::: {#defining-targeted-fields}
::: {#section-2.4 .section}
### [2.4.](#section-2.4){.section-number .selfRef} [Defining Targeted Fields](#name-defining-targeted-fields){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-defining-targeted-fields}

A targeted field for a particular class of cache can be defined by
requesting registration in the \"Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
Field Name Registry\"
(\<<https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-fields/>\>).[¶](#section-2.4-1){.pilcrow}

Registration requests can use this document as the specification
document; in which case, the Comments field should clearly define the
class of caches that the targeted field applies to. Alternatively, if
other documentation for the field has been created, it can be used as
the specification document.[¶](#section-2.4-2){.pilcrow}

By convention, targeted fields have the suffix \"-Cache-Control\", e.g.,
\"ExampleCDN-Cache-Control\". However, this suffix [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be
used on its own to identify targeted fields; it is only a
convention.[¶](#section-2.4-3){.pilcrow}

## [3.](#section-3){.section-number .selfRef} [The CDN-Cache-Control Targeted Field](#name-the-cdn-cache-control-targe){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-the-cdn-cache-control-targe}

The CDN-Cache-Control response header field is a targeted field
([Section 2](#targeted){.xref}) that allows origin servers to control
the behavior of CDN caches interposed between them and clients
separately from other caches that might handle the
response.[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

It applies to caches that are part of a distributed network that operate
on behalf of an origin server (commonly called a
CDN).[¶](#section-3-2){.pilcrow}

CDN caches that use CDN-Cache-Control will typically forward this header
so that downstream CDN caches can use it as well. However, they
[MAY]{.bcp14} remove it when this is undesirable (for example, when
configured to do so because it is known not to be used
downstream).[¶](#section-3-3){.pilcrow}

::: {#examples}
::: {#section-3.1 .section}
### [3.1.](#section-3.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Examples](#name-examples){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-examples}

For example, the following header fields would instruct a CDN cache
(i.e., a cache with a target list of `[CDN-Cache-Control]`) to consider
the response fresh for 600 seconds, other shared caches to consider the
response fresh for 120 seconds, and any remaining caches to consider the
response fresh for 60 seconds:[¶](#section-3.1-1){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-3.1-2}
``` {.lang-http-message .sourcecode}
Cache-Control: max-age=60, s-maxage=120
CDN-Cache-Control: max-age=600
```

[¶](#section-3.1-2){.pilcrow}
:::

These header fields would instruct a CDN cache to consider the response
fresh for 600 seconds, while all other caches would be prevented from
storing it:[¶](#section-3.1-3){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-3.1-4}
``` {.lang-http-message .sourcecode}
CDN-Cache-Control: max-age=600
Cache-Control: no-store
```

[¶](#section-3.1-4){.pilcrow}
:::

Because CDN-Cache-Control is not present, this header field would
prevent all caches from storing the
response:[¶](#section-3.1-5){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-3.1-6}
``` {.lang-http-message .sourcecode}
Cache-Control: no-store
```

[¶](#section-3.1-6){.pilcrow}
:::

Whereas these would prevent all caches except for CDN caches from
storing the response:[¶](#section-3.1-7){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-3.1-8}
``` {.lang-http-message .sourcecode}
Cache-Control: no-store
CDN-Cache-Control: none
```

[¶](#section-3.1-8){.pilcrow}

avoid sending a header field with an empty value, which would be
