# RFC 8739 {#rfcnum}

# Support for Short-Term, Automatically Renewed (STAR) Certificates in the Automated Certificate Management Environment (ACME) {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

Public key certificates need to be revoked when they are compromised,
that is, when the associated private key is exposed to an unauthorized
entity. However, the revocation process is often unreliable. An
alternative to revocation is issuing a sequence of certificates, each
with a short validity period, and terminating the sequence upon
compromise. This memo proposes an Automated Certificate Management
Environment (ACME) extension to enable the issuance of Short-Term,
Automatically Renewed (STAR) X.509
certificates.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

The ACME protocol \[[RFC8555](#RFC8555){.xref}\] automates the process
of issuing a certificate to a named entity (an Identifier Owner or IdO).
Typically, but not always, the identifier is a domain
name.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

If the IdO wishes to obtain a string of short-term certificates
originating from the same private key (see
\[[TOPALOVIC](#TOPALOVIC){.xref}\] about why using short-lived
certificates might be preferable to explicit revocation), she must go
through the whole ACME protocol each time a new short-term certificate
is needed, e.g., every 2-3 days. If done this way, the process would
involve frequent interactions between the registration function of the
ACME Certification Authority (CA) and the identity provider
infrastructure (e.g., DNS, web servers), therefore making the issuance
of short-term certificates exceedingly dependent on the reliability of
both.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

This document presents an extension of the ACME protocol that optimizes
this process by making short-term certificates first-class objects in
the ACME ecosystem. Once the Order for a string of short-term
certificates is accepted, the CA is responsible for publishing the next
certificate at an agreed upon URL before the previous one expires. The
IdO can terminate the automatic renewal before the negotiated deadline
if needed, e.g., on key compromise.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

For a more generic treatment of STAR certificates, readers are referred
to
\[[SHORT-TERM-CERTS](#I-D.nir-saag-star){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

### [1.1.](#section-1.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Name Delegation Use Case](#name-name-delegation-use-case){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-name-delegation-use-case}

The proposed mechanism can be used as a building block of an efficient
name-delegation protocol, for example, one that exists between a Content
Distribution Network (CDN) or a cloud provider and its customers
\[[STAR-DELEGATION](#I-D.ietf-acme-star-delegation){.xref}\]. At any
time, the service customer (i.e., the IdO) can terminate the delegation
by simply instructing the CA to stop the automatic renewal and letting
the currently active certificate expire shortly
thereafter.[¶](#section-1.1-1){.pilcrow}

Note that in the name delegation use case, the delegated entity needs to
access the auto-renewed certificate without being in possession of the
ACME account key that was used for initiating the STAR issuance. This
leads to the optional use of unauthenticated GET in this protocol
([Section
3.4](#certificate-get-nego){.xref}).[¶](#section-1.1-2){.pilcrow}

## [2.](#section-2){.section-number .selfRef} [Protocol Flow](#name-protocol-flow){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-protocol-flow}

The following subsections describe the three main phases of the
protocol:[¶](#section-2-1){.pilcrow}

-   [Bootstrap: the IdO asks an ACME CA to create a short-term,
    automatically renewed (STAR) certificate ([Section
    2.1](#proto-bootstrap){.xref});[¶](#section-2-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-2-2.1}
-   [Auto-renewal: the ACME CA periodically reissues the short-term
    certificate and posts it to the star-certificate URL ([Section
    2.2](#proto-auto-renewal){.xref});[¶](#section-2-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-2-2.2}
-   [Termination: the IdO requests the ACME CA to discontinue the
    automatic renewal of the certificate ([Section
    2.3](#proto-termination){.xref}).[¶](#section-2-2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-2-2.3}

::: {#proto-bootstrap}
::: {#section-2.1 .section}
### [2.1.](#section-2.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Bootstrap](#name-bootstrap){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-bootstrap}

The IdO, in its role as an ACME client, requests the CA to issue a STAR
certificate, i.e., one that:[¶](#section-2.1-1){.pilcrow}

-   [Has a short validity, e.g., 24 to 72 hours. Note that the exact
    definition of \"short\" depends on the use
    case;[¶](#section-2.1-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.1-2.1}
-   [Is automatically renewed by the CA for a certain period of
    time;[¶](#section-2.1-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.1-2.2}
-   [Is downloadable from a (highly available)
    location.[¶](#section-2.1-2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.1-2.3}

Other than that, the ACME protocol flows as usual between IdO and CA. In
particular, IdO is responsible for satisfying the requested ACME
challenges until the CA is willing to issue the requested certificate.
Per normal ACME processing, the IdO is given back an Order resource
associated with the STAR certificate to be used in subsequent
interaction with the CA (e.g., if the certificate needs to be
terminated.)[¶](#section-2.1-3){.pilcrow}

The bootstrap phase ends when the ACME CA updates the Order resource to
include the URL for the issued STAR
certificate.[¶](#section-2.1-4){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-2.2 .section}
### [2.2.](#section-2.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Auto Renewal](#name-auto-renewal){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-auto-renewal}

The CA issues the initial certificate after the authorization completes
successfully. It then automatically reissues the certificate using the
same Certificate Signing Request (CSR) (and therefore the same
identifier and public key) before the previous one expires and publishes
it to the URL that was returned to the IdO at the end of the bootstrap
phase. The certificate user, which could be either the IdO itself or a
delegated third party as described in
\[[STAR-DELEGATION](#I-D.ietf-acme-star-delegation){.xref}\], obtains
the certificate ([Section 3.3](#fetching-certificates){.xref}) and uses
it.[¶](#section-2.2-1){.pilcrow}

The auto-renewal process ([Figure 1](#figprotorefresh){.xref}) goes on
until either:[¶](#section-2.2-2){.pilcrow}

-   [IdO explicitly terminates the automatic renewal ([Section
    2.3](#proto-termination){.xref});
    or[¶](#section-2.2-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.2-3.1}
-   [Automatic renewal
    expires.[¶](#section-2.2-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.2-3.2}

The Order resource is extended with a new \"auto-renewal\" object that
[MUST]{.bcp14} be present for STAR certificates. The \"auto-renewal\"
object has the following structure:[¶](#section-3.1.1-1){.pilcrow}

-   [start-date (optional, string): The earliest date of validity of the
    first certificate issued, in \[[RFC3339](#RFC3339){.xref}\] format.
    When omitted, the start date is as soon as authorization is
    complete.[¶](#section-3.1.1-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.1.1-2.1}
-   [end-date (required, string): The latest date of validity of the
    last certificate issued, in \[[RFC3339](#RFC3339){.xref}\]
    format.[¶](#section-3.1.1-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.1.1-2.2}
-   [lifetime (required, integer): The maximum validity period of each
    STAR certificate, an integer that denotes a number of seconds. This
    is a nominal value that does not include any extra validity time due
    to server or client adjustment (see
    below).[¶](#section-3.1.1-2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.1.1-2.3}
-   [lifetime-adjust (optional, integer): The amount of \"left pad\"
    added to each STAR certificate, an integer that denotes a number of
    seconds. The default is 0. If present, the value of the notBefore
    field that would otherwise appear in the STAR certificates is
    pre-dated by the specified number of seconds. See [Section
    4.1](#operational-cons-clocks){.xref} for why a client might want to
    use this control, and [Section
    3.5](#computing-effective-cert-lifetime){.xref} for how the
    effective certificate lifetime is computed. The value reflected by
    the server, together with the value of the lifetime attribute, can
    be used by the client as a hint to configure its polling
    timer.[¶](#section-3.1.1-2.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.1.1-2.4}
-   [allow-certificate-get (optional, boolean): See [Section
    3.4](#certificate-get-nego){.xref}.[¶](#section-3.1.1-2.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.1.1-2.5}

These attributes are included in a POST message when creating the Order
as part of the object encoded as \"payload\". They are returned when the
Order has been created. The ACME server [MAY]{.bcp14} adjust them at
will according to its local policy (see also [Section
3.2](#capability-discovery){.xref}).[¶](#section-3.1.1-3){.pilcrow}

The optional notBefore and notAfter fields defined in [Section
7.1.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8555#section-7.1.3){.relref} of
\[[RFC8555](#RFC8555){.xref}\] [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be present in a STAR
Order. If they are included, the server [MUST]{.bcp14} return an error
with status code 400 (Bad Request) and type
\"malformedRequest\".[¶](#section-3.1.1-4){.pilcrow}

[Section
7.1.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8555#section-7.1.6){.relref} of
\[[RFC8555](#RFC8555){.xref}\] defines the following values for the
Order resource\'s status: \"pending\", \"ready\", \"processing\",
\"valid\", and \"invalid\". In the case of auto-renewal Orders, the
status [MUST]{.bcp14} be \"valid\" as long as STAR certificates are
being issued. This document adds a new status value: \"canceled\" (see
[Section
3.1.2](#protocol-details-canceling){.xref}).[¶](#section-3.1.1-5){.pilcrow}

A STAR certificate is by definition a dynamic resource, i.e., it refers
to an entity that varies over time. Instead of overloading the semantics
of the \"certificate\" attribute, this document defines a new attribute,
\"star-certificate\", to be used instead of
\"certificate\".[¶](#section-3.1.1-6){.pilcrow}

-   [star-certificate (optional, string): A URL for the (rolling) STAR
    certificate that has been issued in response to this
    Order.[¶](#section-3.1.1-7.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.1.1-7.1}

An important property of the auto-renewal Order is that it can be

To improve robustness, the next certificate [MUST]{.bcp14} be made

available, the cancellation is not completely effective until the

entering a broken state, the notBefore of the \"next\" certificate
[MUST]{.bcp14} be set so that the certificate is already valid when it
is published at the \"star-certificate\" URL. Note that the server might
need to increase the auto-renewal lifetime-adjust value to satisfy the
latter requirement. For a detailed description of the renewal scheduling

In order to enable the name delegation workflow defined in
\[[STAR-DELEGATION](#I-D.ietf-acme-star-delegation){.xref}\] and to
increase the reliability of the STAR ecosystem (see [Section
4.3](#dependability){.xref} for details), this document defines a
mechanism that allows a server to advertise support for accessing
star-certificate resources via unauthenticated GET (in addition to
POST-as-GET), and a client to enable this service with per-Order
granularity.[¶](#section-3.4-1){.pilcrow}

Specifically, a server states its availability to grant unauthenticated
access to a client\'s Order star-certificate by setting the
allow-certificate-get attribute to \"true\" in the auto-renewal object
of the meta field inside the directory
object:[¶](#section-3.4-2){.pilcrow}

-   [allow-certificate-get (optional, boolean): If this field is present
    and set to \"true\", the server allows GET (and HEAD) requests to
    star-certificate
    URLs.[¶](#section-3.4-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.4-3.1}

A client states its desire to access the issued star-certificate via
unauthenticated GET by adding an allow-certificate-get attribute to the
auto-renewal object of the payload of its newOrder request and setting
it to \"true\".[¶](#section-3.4-4){.pilcrow}

-   [allow-certificate-get (optional, boolean): If this field is present
    and set to \"true\", the client requests the server to allow
    unauthenticated GET (and HEAD) to the star-certificate associated
    with this Order.[¶](#section-3.4-5.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.4-5.1}

If the server accepts the request, it [MUST]{.bcp14} reflect the
attribute setting in the resulting order
object.[¶](#section-3.4-6){.pilcrow}

Note that even when the use of unauthenticated GET has been agreed upon,
the server [MUST]{.bcp14} also allow POST-as-GET requests to the

\"Short Term\" is a relative concept; therefore, trying to define a
cutoff point that works in all cases would be a useless exercise. In
practice, the expected lifetime of a STAR certificate will be counted in
minutes, hours, or days, depending on different factors: the underlying
requirements for revocation, how much clock synchronization is expected
among relying parties and the issuing CA,
etc.[¶](#section-4.1-1){.pilcrow}

Nevertheless, this section attempts to provide reasonable suggestions
for the Web use case, informed by current operational and research
experience.[¶](#section-4.1-2){.pilcrow}

Acer et al. \[[ACER](#ACER){.xref}\] find that one of the main causes of
\"HTTPS error\" warnings in browsers is misconfigured client clocks. In
particular, they observe that roughly 95% of the \"severe\" clock skews
\-- the 6.7% of clock-related breakage reports that account for clients
that are more than 24 hours behind \-- happen to be within 6-7
days.[¶](#section-4.1-3){.pilcrow}

In order to avoid these spurious warnings about a not yet valid server
certificate, site owners could use the auto-renewal lifetime-adjust
attribute to control the effective lifetime of their Web-facing
certificates. The exact number depends on the percentage of the
\"clock-skewed\" population that the site owner expects to protect \-- 5
days cover 97.3%, 7 days cover 99.6% \-- as well as the nominal
auto-renewal lifetime of the STAR Order. Note that exact choice is also
likely to depend on the kinds of client that are prevalent for a given
site or app \-- for example, Android and Mac OS clients are known to
behave better than Windows clients. These considerations are clearly out
of scope of this document.[¶](#section-4.1-4){.pilcrow}

In terms of security, STAR certificates and certificates with the Online
Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) \"must-staple\" flag asserted
\[[RFC7633](#RFC7633){.xref}\] can be considered roughly equivalent if
the STAR certificate\'s and the OCSP response\'s lifetimes are the same.
(Here, \"must-staple\" refers to a certificate carrying a TLS feature
extension with the \"status_request\" extension identifier
\[[RFC6066](#RFC6066){.xref}\].) Given OCSP responses can be cached, on
average, for 4 days \[[STARK](#STARK){.xref}\], it is
[RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14} that a STAR certificate that is used on the Web
has an \"effective\" lifetime (excluding any adjustment to account for
clock skews) no longer than 4 days.[¶](#section-4.1-5){.pilcrow}

Even in the highly unlikely case STAR becomes the only certificate

implementers of Certificate Transparency (CT) logs suggests that
existing CT Log server implementations are capable of sustaining the

future higher load could be managed with a variety of techniques (e.g.,
sharding by modulo of certificate hash, using \"smart\" load-balancing
CT proxies, etc.). With regards to the increase in the log size, current
CT log growth is already being managed with schemes like Chrome\'s Log
Policy \[[OBRIEN](#OBRIEN){.xref}\], which allow Operators to define
their log life cycle, as well as allowing the CAs, User Agents,

When using authenticated POST-as-GET, the HTTPS endpoint from where the
STAR certificate is fetched can\'t be easily replicated by an on-path
HTTP cache. Reducing the caching properties of the protocol makes STAR
clients increasingly dependent on the ACME server availability. This
might be problematic given the relatively high rate of client-server
interactions in a STAR ecosystem, especially when multiple endpoints
(e.g., a high number of CDN edge nodes) end up requesting the same
certificate. Clients and servers should consider using the mechanism
described in [Section 3.4](#certificate-get-nego){.xref} to mitigate the
risk.[¶](#section-4.3-1){.pilcrow}

When using unauthenticated GET to fetch the STAR certificate, the server
[SHALL]{.bcp14} use the appropriate cache directives to set the
freshness lifetime of the response ([Section

STAR certificates eliminate an important security feature of PKI, which
is the ability to revoke certificates. Revocation allows the
administrator to limit the damage done by a rogue node or an adversary
who has control of the private key. With STAR certificates, expiration
replaces revocation so there is potential for lack of timeliness in the
revocation taking effect. To that end, see also the discussion on clock
skew in [Section
4.1](#operational-cons-clocks){.xref}.[¶](#section-6.1-1){.pilcrow}

It should be noted that revocation also has timeliness issues because
both Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) and OCSP responses have
nextUpdate fields that tell relying parties (RPs) how long they should
trust this revocation data. These fields are typically set to hours,
days, or even weeks in the future. Any revocation that happens before
the time in nextUpdate goes unnoticed by the
RP.[¶](#section-6.1-2){.pilcrow}

One situation where the lack of explicit revocation could create a
security risk to the IdO is when the Order is created with a start-date
of some appreciable amount of time in the future. Recall that when
authorizations have been fulfilled, the Order moves to the \"valid\"
state and the star-certificate endpoint is populated with the first cert
([Figure 4](#fig-order-state-transitions-ext){.xref}). So, if an
attacker manages to get hold of the private key as well as the first
(post-dated) certificate, there is a time window in the future when they
will be able to successfully impersonate the IdO. Note that cancellation
is pointless in this case. In order to mitigate the described threat, it
is [RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14} that IdO place their Orders at a time that is
close to the Order\'s start-date.[¶](#section-6.1-3){.pilcrow}

### [6.2.](#section-6.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Denial-of-Service Considerations](#name-denial-of-service-considera){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-denial-of-service-considera}

STAR adds a new attack vector that increases the threat of
denial-of-service attacks, caused by the change to the CA\'s behavior.
Each STAR request amplifies the resource demands upon the CA, where one
Order produces not one but potentially dozens or hundreds of
certificates, depending on the auto-renewal \"lifetime\" parameter. An
attacker can use this property to aggressively reduce the auto-renewal
\"lifetime\" (e.g., 1 second) jointly with other ACME attack vectors
identified in [Section
10](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8555#section-10){.relref} of
\[[RFC8555](#RFC8555){.xref}\]. Other collateral impact is related to
the certificate endpoint resource where the client can retrieve the
certificates periodically. If this resource is external to the CA (e.g.,
a hosted web server), the previous attack will be reflected to that
resource.[¶](#section-6.2-1){.pilcrow}

Mitigation recommendations from ACME still apply, but some of them need
to be adjusted. For example, applying rate limiting to the initial
request, due to the nature of the auto-renewal behavior, cannot solve
the above problem. The CA server needs complementary mitigation, and
specifically, it [SHOULD]{.bcp14} enforce a minimum value on
auto-renewal \"lifetime\". Alternatively, the CA can set a rate limit
for internal certificate generation processes. Note that this limit has
to take account of already scheduled renewal issuances as well as new
incoming requests.[¶](#section-6.2-2){.pilcrow}
