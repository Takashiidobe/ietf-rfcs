# Additional Units for Sensor Measurement Lists (SenML) {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

The Sensor Measurement Lists (SenML) media type supports the indication
of units for a quantity represented. This short document registers a
number of additional unit names in the IANA registry for units in SenML.
It also defines a registry for secondary units that cannot be in
SenML\'s main registry, as they are derived by linear transformation
from units already in that registry.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

The Sensor Measurement Lists (SenML) \[[RFC8428](#RFC8428){.xref}\]
media type supports the indication of a unit, using the SenML field
\"u\", for the quantity given as a data value in a SenML record. For
this purpose, SenML defines an IANA registry of defined unit names and
their meanings; in the present document, we call the unit names
registered there \"primary unit names\".[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

This short document registers a number of additional units in the IANA
registry for units in SenML that appear to be necessary for further
adopting SenML in other Standards Development Organizations
(SDOs).[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

The document also defines a registry for secondary unit names that
cannot be in SenML\'s main registry, as they are derived by linear
transformation from units already in that registry. Although SenML
version 10 \[[RFC8428](#RFC8428){.xref}\] does not provide for the
direct use of these secondary units, future support is intended via the
use of SenML extension mechanisms, one of which is proposed in
\[[SENML-VERSIONS](#I-D.ietf-core-senml-versions){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

The key words \"[MUST]{.bcp14}\", \"[MUST NOT]{.bcp14}\",

### [2.1.](#section-2.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Rationale](#name-rationale){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-rationale}

SenML \[[RFC8428](#RFC8428){.xref}\] takes the position that unscaled SI
units should always be used. However, SenML makes one exception: The
degree Celsius (as Cel) is allowed as an alternative to the K
(Kelvin).[¶](#section-2.1-1){.pilcrow}

This document takes the position that the same should apply to a small
number of alternative units in wide use:[¶](#section-2.1-2){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

The Byte:
:   \[[IEC-80000-13](#IEC-80000-13){.xref}\] defines both the bit (item
    13-9.b) and the byte (item 13-9.c, also called octet) as alternative
    names for the coherent unit used for dimensionless quantities, for
    the purpose of giving storage capacity and related quantities. While
    the name octet is associated with the symbol o, this is in wide use
    only in French-speaking countries. Globally more widespread is the
    symbol B for byte, even though B is already taken in SI for bel.
    \[[RFC8428](#RFC8428){.xref}\] therefore registers dB as the SenML
    unit for logarithmic relative power, leaving B free for the usage
    proposed here. While this is potentially confusing, the situation is
    widely understood in engineering circles and is unlikely to cause
    actual problems.[¶](#section-2.1-3.2){.pilcrow}
:   

The Volt-Ampere:
:   \[[IEC-80000-6](#IEC-80000-6){.xref}\] defines the volt ampere (VA)
    (item 6-57.a) as a unit for apparent power; items 6-59.a, 6-60.a,
    and 6-61.a also use the unit for complex, reactive, and non-active
    power.[¶](#section-2.1-3.4){.pilcrow}
:   

The Volt-Ampere Reactive:
:   \[[IEC-80000-6](#IEC-80000-6){.xref}\] item 6-60.b defines the
    volt-ampere reactive (var) as an alternative (and fully equivalent)
    unit to VA specifically for reactive power (with the primary unit
    VA); it has become clear that there is strong interest in using this
    unit specifically for the imaginary content of complex power, i.e.,
    reactive power
    \[[IEEE-1459](#IEEE-1459){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2.1-3.6){.pilcrow}
:   

The Joule per meter is not a traditional electromagnetic unit. It and
its scaled derivatives (in particular Wh/km) are used to describe the
energy expended for achieving motion over a given distance, e.g., as an
equivalent for electrical cars of the inverse of
\"mileage\".[¶](#section-2.1-4){.pilcrow}

The unit \"degree\" is in wide use in practice for plane angles (as in
heading, bearing, etc.). It is marked with an asterisk because the
preferred coherent SI unit is radian
(\"rad\").[¶](#section-2.1-5){.pilcrow}

## [3.](#section-3){.section-number .selfRef} [New Registry for Secondary Units](#name-new-registry-for-secondary-){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-new-registry-for-secondary-}

IANA has created a \"Secondary Units\" subregistry in the \"Sensor
Measurement Lists (SenML)\" registry
\[[IANA.SENML](#IANA.SENML){.xref}\] defined in
\[[RFC8428](#RFC8428){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

The registry has six columns:[¶](#section-3-2){.pilcrow}

-   [Secondary Unit: a newly registered name allocated within the same
    namespace as SenML
    units[¶](#section-3-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-3.1}
-   [Description: a short description (usually just the expansion of an
    abbreviation)[¶](#section-3-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-3.2}
-   [SenML Unit: an existing SenML unit from the SenML Units
    registry[¶](#section-3-3.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-3.3}
-   [Scale, Offset: two rational numbers, expressed in decimal
    (optionally, with a decimal exponent given) or as a fraction
    represented using a \"/\" character to separate numerator and
    denominator[¶](#section-3-3.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-3.4}
-   [Reference: where the entry comes
    from[¶](#section-3-3.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-3.5}

Quantities expressed in the secondary unit can be converted into the
SenML unit by first multiplying their value with the scale number and
then adding the offset, yielding the value in the given SenML
unit.[¶](#section-3-4){.pilcrow}

:::

Note 1: This registration does not use the obvious name \"%\" because
this name has been taken in \[[RFC8428](#RFC8428){.xref}\] already,
where it is a [NOT RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14} synonym for \"/\" (unity) for
legacy reasons. Note that the presence of both \"%\" and \"/100\" with
different meanings is likely to create confusion, so the present
document adds some weight to the recommendation against using the
counterintuitive unit name \"%\".[¶](#section-3-7.1){.pilcrow}

Example: The value of a quantity given as 100 ms is first multiplied by
1/1000, yielding the number 0.1, and the offset 0 is then added,
yielding the number 0.1 again, leading to a quantity of 0.1 s. The value
of a quantity given as 10 dBm is first multiplied by 1, yielding the
number 10, and the offset -30 is then added, yielding the number -20,
leading to a quantity of -20 dBW.[¶](#section-3-8){.pilcrow}

New entries can be added to the registration by Expert Review as defined
in \[[RFC8126](#RFC8126){.xref}\]. Experts should exercise their own
good judgment, with the same guidelines as used for SenML units
([Section
12.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8428#section-12.1){.relref} of
\[[RFC8428](#RFC8428){.xref}\]), but without applying rules 4, 5, and 8.
Note that rule 7 limits the use of what could be understood as prefixes
on their own, not the use of prefixes inside secondary unit names.
Guidelines to the difference between units (which can go into the
registry) and quantities (which cannot) are widely available; see, for
instance, \[[RS](#RS){.xref}\] and
\[[BIPM](#BIPM){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3-9){.pilcrow}

As of SenML version 10 \[[RFC8428](#RFC8428){.xref}\], SenML packs are
limited to using primary units in \"u\" fields. The use of primary units
enables direct comparison of measurements from different sources. Also,
it facilitates implementations that trigger on the presence of a
quantity in a certain unit, without the need to track any additional
secondary units that may be registered for this
quantity.[¶](#section-3-10){.pilcrow}

Where the benefits of directly using a secondary unit in a SenML pack
outweigh the above considerations, the use of secondary units in \"u\"
fields [MAY]{.bcp14} be enabled by indicating a new SenML version that
specifically allows this and/or by using a field with a label name that
ends with the \"\_\" character (\"must-understand\" field) whose
definition specifically allows this. The definition of these versions
and fields is outside the scope of the present specification; one such
definition is proposed in
\[[SENML-VERSIONS](#I-D.ietf-core-senml-versions){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3-11){.pilcrow}

The \"Secondary Units\" subregistry is expected to grow at a faster pace
than the subregistry of primary unit names. It also is amenable to
automatic interpretation, by making use of the scale and offset
columns.[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

Implementers may be tempted to equip each instance of their systems with
code to download new versions of the registry from IANA frequently in
order to be able to make use of newly defined secondary unit names. This
can create high load at IANA and a potential single point of failure.
Instead of pulling the registry in each individual instance of the code,
the software update mechanism (or a similar mechanism that leads to less
frequent IANA visits) [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be used to disseminate updated
units registries obtained from IANA towards the instances via common
repositories.[¶](#section-4-2){.pilcrow}

The security considerations of \[[RFC8428](#RFC8428){.xref}\]
apply.[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

The introduction of new measurement units poses no additional security
considerations except a potential for additional confusion about the
proper unit to use and the risk that an implementation based on the
assumption described in the penultimate paragraph of [Section
3](#new-registry){.xref} no longer works properly. However, an
implementation processing a pack while making use of secondary units is
guaranteed to have been developed with an awareness of the risks of
having multiple units available for the same logical type. In any case,
the existing risk of an existing SenML implementation not understanding
a unit that was not in the initial registry content provided in
\[[RFC8428](#RFC8428){.xref}\] is unchanged, and implementations are
warned properly about the potential use of secondary units by the need
for a must-understand field or an updated version
field.[¶](#section-5-2){.pilcrow}
