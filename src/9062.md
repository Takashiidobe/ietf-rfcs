# Framework and Requirements for Ethernet VPN (EVPN) Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

This document specifies the requirements and reference framework for
Ethernet VPN (EVPN) Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM).
The requirements cover the OAM aspects of EVPN and Provider Backbone
Bridge EVPN (PBB-EVPN). The framework defines the layered OAM model
encompassing the EVPN service layer, network layer, underlying Packet
Switched Network (PSN) transport layer, and link layer but focuses on
the service and network layers.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

This document specifies the requirements and defines a reference
framework for Ethernet VPN (EVPN) Operations, Administration, and
Maintenance (OAM) \[[RFC6291](#RFC6291){.xref}\]. In this context, we
use the term \"EVPN OAM\" to loosely refer to the OAM functions required
for and/or applicable to \[[RFC7432](#RFC7432){.xref}\] and
\[[RFC7623](#RFC7623){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

EVPN is a Layer 2 VPN (L2VPN) solution for multipoint Ethernet services
with advanced multihoming capabilities that uses BGP for distributing
Customer/Client Media Access Control (C-MAC) address reachability
information over the core MPLS/IP network.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

PBB-EVPN combines Provider Backbone Bridging (PBB)
\[[IEEE-802.1Q](#IEEE-802.1Q){.xref}\] with EVPN in order to reduce the
number of BGP MAC advertisement routes; provide client MAC address
mobility using C-MAC \[[RFC7623](#RFC7623){.xref}\] aggregation and
Backbone MAC (B-MAC) \[[RFC7623](#RFC7623){.xref}\] sub-netting; confine
the scope of C-MAC learning to only active flows; offer per-site
policies; and avoid C-MAC address flushing on topology
changes.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

This document focuses on the fault management and performance management
aspects of EVPN OAM. It defines the layered OAM model encompassing the
EVPN service layer, network layer, underlying Packet Switched Network
(PSN) transport layer, and link layer but focuses on the service and
network layers.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

This document leverages concepts and draws upon elements defined
and⁠/⁠or used in the following documents:[¶](#section-1.1-1){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC6136](#RFC6136){.xref}\] specifies the requirements and a
reference model for OAM as it relates to L2VPN services, pseudowires,
and associated Packet Switched Network (PSN) tunnels. This document
focuses on Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) and Virtual Private Wire
Service (VPWS) solutions and services.[¶](#section-1.1-2){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC8029](#RFC8029){.xref}\] defines mechanisms for detecting data
plane failures in MPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs), including procedures
to check the correct operation of the data plane as well as mechanisms
to verify the data plane against the control
plane.[¶](#section-1.1-3){.pilcrow}

\[[IEEE-802.1Q](#IEEE-802.1Q){.xref}\] specifies the Ethernet
Connectivity Fault Management (CFM) protocol, which defines the concepts
of Maintenance Domains, Maintenance Associations, Maintenance End
Points, and Maintenance Intermediate
Points.[¶](#section-1.1-4){.pilcrow}

\[[Y.1731](#Y.1731){.xref}\] extends Connectivity Fault Management in
the following areas: it defines fault notification and alarm suppression
functions for Ethernet and specifies mechanisms for Ethernet performance
management, including loss, delay, jitter, and throughput
measurement.[¶](#section-1.1-5){.pilcrow}

Multiple layers come into play for implementing an L2VPN service using
the EVPN family of solutions as listed below. The focus of this document
is the service and network layers.[¶](#section-2.1-1){.pilcrow}

-   [The service layer runs end to end between the sites or Ethernet
    segments that are being interconnected by the EVPN
    solution.[¶](#section-2.1-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.1-2.1}
-   [The network layer extends between the EVPN PE (Provider Edge) nodes
    and is mostly transparent to the P (provider network interior) nodes
    (except where flow entropy comes into play). It leverages MPLS for
    service (i.e., EVI) multiplexing and split-horizon
    functions.[¶](#section-2.1-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.1-2.2}
-   [The transport layer is dictated by the networking technology of the
    PSN. It may be based on either MPLS LSPs or
    IP.[¶](#section-2.1-2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.1-2.3}
-   [The link layer is dependent upon the physical technology used.
    Ethernet is a popular choice for this layer, but other alternatives
    are deployed (e.g., Packet over SONET (POS), Dense Wavelength
    Division Multiplexing (DWDM),
    etc.).[¶](#section-2.1-2.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.1-2.4}

This layering extends to the set of OAM protocols that are involved in
the ongoing maintenance and diagnostics of EVPN networks. [Figure
1](#fig-1){.xref} below depicts the OAM layering and shows which devices
have visibility into what OAM layer(s).[¶](#section-2.1-3){.pilcrow}

Service OAM and Network OAM mechanisms only have visibility to the PE
nodes but not the P nodes. As such, they can be used to deduce whether
the fault is in the customer\'s own network, the local CE-PE segment,
the PE-PE segment, or the remote CE-PE segment(s). EVPN Transport OAM
mechanisms can be used for fault isolation between the PEs and P
nodes.[¶](#section-2.1-5){.pilcrow}

[Figure 2](#fig-2){.xref} below shows an example network where Ethernet
domains are interconnected via EVPN using MPLS, and it shows the OAM
mechanisms that are applicable at each layer. The details of the layers
are described in the sections below.[¶](#section-2.1-6){.pilcrow}

The EVPN Service OAM protocol depends on what service-layer technology
is being interconnected by the EVPN solution. In the case of
\[[RFC7432](#RFC7432){.xref}\] and \[[RFC7623](#RFC7623){.xref}\], the
service layer is Ethernet; hence, the corresponding Service OAM protocol
is Ethernet CFM
\[[IEEE-802.1Q](#IEEE-802.1Q){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2.2-1){.pilcrow}

EVPN Service OAM is visible to the CEs and EVPN PEs but not to the P
nodes. This is because the PEs operate at the Ethernet MAC layer in
\[[RFC7432](#RFC7432){.xref}\] and \[[RFC7623](#RFC7623){.xref}\],
whereas the P nodes do not.[¶](#section-2.2-2){.pilcrow}

The EVPN PE [MUST]{.bcp14} support MIP functions in the applicable
Service OAM protocol (for example, Ethernet CFM). The EVPN PE
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} support MEP functions in the applicable Service OAM
protocol. This includes both Up and Down MEP
functions.[¶](#section-2.2-3){.pilcrow}

As shown in [Figure 3](#fig-3){.xref}, the MIP and MEP functions being
referred to are logically located within the device\'s port operating at
the customer level. (There could be MEPs/MIPs within PE ports facing the
provider network, but they would not be relevant to EVPN Service OAM as
the traffic passing through them will be encapsulated/tunneled, so any
customer-level OAM messages will just be treated as data.) Down MEP
functions are away from the core of the device while Up MEP functions
are towards the core of the device (towards the PE forwarding mechanism
in the case of a PE). OAM messages between the PE Up MEPs shown are a
type of EVPN Network OAM, while such messages between the CEs or from a
PE to its local CE or to the remote CE are Service
OAMs.[¶](#section-2.2-4){.pilcrow}

### [2.6.](#section-2.6){.section-number .selfRef} [OAM Interworking](#name-oam-interworking){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-oam-interworking}

When interworking two networking domains, such as actual Ethernet and
EVPN to provide an end-to-end emulated service, there is a need to
identify the failure domain and location, even when a PE supports both
the Service OAM mechanisms and the EVPN Network OAM mechanisms. In
addition, scalability constraints may not allow the running of proactive
monitoring, such as Ethernet Continuity Check Messages (CCMs)
\[[IEEE-802.1Q](#IEEE-802.1Q){.xref}\], at a PE to detect the failure of
an EVI across the EVPN domain. Thus, the mapping of alarms generated
upon failure detection in one domain (e.g., actual Ethernet or EVPN
network domain) to the other domain is needed. There are also cases
where a PE may not be able to process Service OAM messages received from
a remote PE over the PSN even when such messages are defined, as in the
Ethernet case, thereby necessitating support for fault notification
message mapping between the EVPN Network domain and the Service
domain.[¶](#section-2.6-1){.pilcrow}

OAM interworking is not limited, though, to scenarios involving
disparate network domains. It is possible to perform OAM interworking
across different layers in the same network domain. In general, alarms
generated within an OAM layer, as a result of proactive fault detection
mechanisms, may be injected into its client-layer OAM mechanisms. This
allows the client-layer OAM to trigger event-driven (i.e., asynchronous)
fault notifications. For example, alarms generated by the Link OAM
mechanisms may be injected into the Transport OAM layer, and alarms
generated by the Transport OAM mechanism may be injected into the
Network OAM mechanism, and so on.[¶](#section-2.6-2){.pilcrow}

EVPN OAM [MUST]{.bcp14} support interworking between the Network OAM and

Proactive fault detection is performed by periodically monitoring the
reachability between service end points, i.e., MEPs in a given MA,

    does not conclusively indicate liveness of the path(s) taken by user
    data traffic. This enables node failure detection but not path
    failure detection through the use of a test flow. EVPN Network OAM

    flows.[¶](#section-3.1.1.1-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.1.1.1-2.2}
-   [all paths. For MPLS/IP networks with ECMP, the monitoring of all
    unicast paths between MEPs (on non-adjacent nodes) may not be
    possible since the per-hop ECMP hashing behavior may yield
    situations where it is impossible for a MEP to pick flow entropy
    characteristics that result in exercising the exhaustive set of ECMP
    paths. The monitoring of all ECMP paths between MEPs (on

#### [3.2.1.](#section-3.2.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Packet Loss](#name-packet-loss){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-packet-loss}

EVPN Network OAM [SHOULD]{.bcp14} provide mechanisms for measuring
packet loss for a given service \-- for example,
\[[RFC7680](#RFC7680){.xref}\] and
\[[RFC6673](#RFC6673){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3.2.1-1){.pilcrow}

Given that EVPN provides inherent support for multipoint-to-multipoint
connectivity, packet loss cannot be accurately measured by means of
counting user data packets. This is because user packets can be
delivered to more PEs or more ports than are necessary (e.g., due to
broadcast, unpruned multicast, or unknown unicast flooding). As such, a
statistical means of approximating the packet loss rate is required.
This can be achieved by sending \"synthetic\" OAM packets that are
counted only by those ports (MEPs) that are required to receive them.
This provides a statistical approximation of the number of data frames
lost, even with multipoint-to-multipoint
connectivity.[¶](#section-3.2.1-2){.pilcrow}

EVPN Service OAM [SHOULD]{.bcp14} support measurement of one-way and
two-way packet delay and delay variation (jitter) across the EVPN
network. Measurement of one-way delay requires clock synchronization
between the probe source and target devices. Mechanisms for clock
synchronization are outside the scope of this document. Note that
Service OAM performance management mechanisms defined in
\[[Y.1731](#Y.1731){.xref}\] can be used. See also
\[[RFC7679](#RFC7679){.xref}\], \[[RFC2681](#RFC2681){.xref}\], and
\[[RFC3393](#RFC3393){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3.2.2-1){.pilcrow}

EVPN Network OAM [MAY]{.bcp14} support measurement of one-way and
two-way packet delay and delay variation (jitter) across the EVPN

EVPN OAM [MUST]{.bcp14} prevent OAM packets from leaking outside of the
EVPN network or outside their corresponding Maintenance Domain. This can
be done for CFM, for example, by having MEPs implement a filtering
function based on the Maintenance Level associated with received OAM
packets.[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

EVPN OAM [SHOULD]{.bcp14} provide mechanisms for implementation and
optional use to:[¶](#section-4-2){.pilcrow}

    message channel (for example, by forging messages to exceed a
