# RFC 9237 {#rfcnum}

# An Authorization Information Format (AIF) for Authentication and Authorization for Constrained Environments (ACE) {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

Information about which entities are authorized to perform what
operations on which constituents of other entities is a crucial
component of producing an overall system that is secure. Conveying
precise authorization information is especially critical in highly
automated systems with large numbers of entities, such as the Internet
of Things.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

This specification provides a generic information model and format for
representing such authorization information, as well as two variants of
a specific instantiation of that format for use with Representational
State Transfer (REST) resources identified by URI
path.[¶](#section-abstract-2){.pilcrow}

Constrained devices, as they are used in the Internet of Things, need
security in order to operate correctly and prevent misuse. One important
element of this security is that devices in the Internet of Things need
to be able to decide which operations requested of them should be
considered authorized, ascertain that the authorization to request the
operation does apply to the actual requester as authenticated, and
ascertain that other devices they make requests of are the ones they
intended.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

To transfer detailed authorization information from an authorization
manager (such as an ACE-OAuth authorization server
\[[RFC9200](#RFC9200){.xref}\]) to a device, a compact representation
format is needed. This document defines such a format \-- the
Authorization Information Format (AIF). AIF is defined both as a general
structure that can be used for many different applications and as a
specific instantiation tailored to REST resources and the permissions on
them, including some provision for dynamically created
resources.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC7252](#RFC7252){.xref}\] and the Internet Security Glossary
\[[RFC4949](#RFC4949){.xref}\]; CoAP is used for the explanatory
examples as it is a good fit for constrained
devices.[¶](#section-1.1-1){.pilcrow}

The shape of data is specified in Concise Data Definition Language

## [2.](#section-2){.section-number .selfRef} [Information Model](#name-information-model){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-information-model}

Authorizations are generally expressed through some data structures that
are cryptographically secured (or transmitted in a secure way). This
section discusses the information model underlying the payload of that
data (as opposed to the cryptographic armor around
it).[¶](#section-2-1){.pilcrow}

The semantics of the authorization information defined in this document
are that of an *allow-list*: everything is denied until it is explicitly
allowed.[¶](#section-2-2){.pilcrow}

For the purposes of this specification, the underlying access control
model will be that of an access matrix, which gives a set of permissions
for each possible combination of a subject and an object. We are
focusing the AIF data item on a single row in the access matrix (such a
row has often been called a \"capability list\") without concern to the
subject for which the data item is issued. As a consequence, AIF
[MUST]{.bcp14} be used in a way that the subject of the authorizations
is unambiguously identified (e.g., as part of the armor around
it).[¶](#section-2-3){.pilcrow}

The generic model of such a capability list is a list of pairs of object
identifiers (of type `Toid`) and the permissions (of type `Tperm`) that
the subject has on the object(s) identified.[¶](#section-2-4){.pilcrow}

:::

In a specific data model (such as the one specified in this document),
the object identifier (`Toid`) will often be a text string, and the set
of permissions (`Tperm`) will be represented by a bit set, which in turn
is represented as a number (see [Section
3](#data-model){.xref}).[¶](#section-2-6){.pilcrow}

### [2.1.](#section-2.1){.section-number .selfRef} [REST-Specific Model](#name-rest-specific-model){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-rest-specific-model}

In the specific instantiation of the REST resources and the permissions
on them, we use the URI of a resource on a CoAP server for the object
identifier (`Toid`). More specifically, since the parts of the URI that
identify the server (\"authority\" in \[[RFC3986](#RFC3986){.xref}\])
are authenticated during REST resource access ([Section
4.2.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-4.2.2){.relref} of
\[[RFC9110](#RFC9110){.xref}\] and [Section
6.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7252#section-6.2){.relref} of
\[[RFC7252](#RFC7252){.xref}\]), they naturally fall into the realm
handled by the cryptographic armor; we therefore focus on the \"path\"
(\"path-abempty\") and \"query\" parts of the URI (*URI-local-part* in
this specification, as expressed by the Uri-Path and Uri-Query options
in CoAP). As a consequence, AIF [MUST]{.bcp14} be used in a way that it
is clear who is the target (enforcement point) of these authorizations
(note that there may be more than one target that the same authorization
applies to, e.g., in a situation with homogeneous
devices).[¶](#section-2.1-1){.pilcrow}

For the permissions (`Tperm`), we use a simple permissions model that
lists the subset of the REST (CoAP or HTTP) methods permitted. This
model is summarized in [Table
1](#im-example){.xref}.[¶](#section-2.1-2){.pilcrow}

[]{#name-an-authorization-instance-i}

::: {#im-example}
  URI-local-part   Permission Set
  ---------------- ----------------
  /s/temp          GET
  /a/led           PUT, GET
  /dtls            POST

  : [Table 1](#table-1){.selfRef}: [An Authorization Instance in the
  REST-Specific AIF Information
  Model](#name-an-authorization-instance-i){.selfRef}
:::

In this example, a device offers a temperature sensor `/s/temp` for
read-only access, a LED actuator `/a/led` for read/write, and a `/dtls`
resource for POST access.[¶](#section-2.1-4){.pilcrow}

As shown in the data model ([Section 3](#data-model){.xref}), the
representations of REST methods provided are limited to those that have
a CoAP method number assigned; an extension to the model may be
necessary to represent permissions for exotic HTTP
methods.[¶](#section-2.1-5){.pilcrow}
:::
:::

::: {#limitations}
::: {#section-2.2 .section}
### [2.2.](#section-2.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Limitations](#name-limitations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-limitations}

This simple information model only allows granting permissions for
statically identifiable objects, e.g., URIs for the REST-specific
instantiation. One might be tempted to extend the model towards URI
templates \[[RFC6570](#RFC6570){.xref}\] (for instance, to open up an
authorization for many parameter values as in `/s/temp{?any*}`).
However, that requires some considerations of the ease and unambiguity
of matching a given URI against a set of templates in an AIF data
item.[¶](#section-2.2-1){.pilcrow}

This simple information model also does not allow expressing
conditionalized access based on state outside the identification of
objects (e.g., \"opening a door is allowed if it is not
locked\").[¶](#section-2.2-2){.pilcrow}

Finally, the model does not provide any special access for a set of
resources that are specific to a subject, e.g., that the subject created
itself by previous operations (PUT, POST, or PATCH/iPATCH
\[[RFC8132](#RFC8132){.xref}\]) or that were specifically created for
the subject by others.[¶](#section-2.2-3){.pilcrow}

### [2.3.](#section-2.3){.section-number .selfRef} [REST-Specific Model with Dynamic Resource Creation](#name-rest-specific-model-with-dy){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-rest-specific-model-with-dy}

The *REST-specific model with dynamic resource creation* addresses the
need to provide defined access to dynamic resources that were created by
the subject itself, specifically, a resource that is made known to the
subject by providing Location-\* options in a CoAP response or using the
Location header field in HTTP \[[RFC9110](#RFC9110){.xref}\] (the
Location-indicating mechanisms). (The concept is somewhat comparable to
\"Access Control List (ACL) inheritance\" in the Network File System
version 4 (NFSv4) protocol \[[RFC8881](#RFC8881){.xref}\], except that
it does not use a containment relationship but rather the fact that the
dynamic resource was created from a resource to which the subject had
access.) In other words, it addresses an important subset of the third
limitation mentioned in [Section
2.2](#limitations){.xref}.[¶](#section-2.3-1){.pilcrow}

[]{#name-an-authorization-instance-in}

::: {#im-example-dynamic}
  URI-local-part   Permission Set
  ---------------- -----------------------------------
  /a/make-coffee   POST, Dynamic-GET, Dynamic-DELETE

  : [Table 2](#table-2){.selfRef}: [An Authorization Instance in the
  REST-Specific AIF Information Model with Dynamic Resource
  Creation](#name-an-authorization-instance-in){.selfRef}
:::

For a method X, the presence of a Dynamic-X permission means that the
subject holds permission to exercise the method X on resources that have
been returned in a 2.01 (201 Created) response by a Location-indicating
mechanism to a request that the subject made to the resource listed. In
the example shown in [Table 2](#im-example-dynamic){.xref}, POST
operations on `/a/make-coffee` might return the location of a resource
dynamically created on the coffee machine that allows GET to find out
about the status of, and DELETE to cancel, the coffee-making
operation.[¶](#section-2.3-3){.pilcrow}

Since the use of the extension defined in this section can be detected
by the mentioning of the Dynamic-X permissions, there is no need for
another explicit switch between the basic and the model extended by
dynamic resource creation; the extended model is always presumed once a
Dynamic-X permission is present.[¶](#section-2.3-4){.pilcrow}

Different data model specializations can be defined for the generic
information model given above.[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

In this section, we will give the data model for simple REST
authorization as per Sections [2.1](#rest-model){.xref} and
[2.3](#ext-rest-model){.xref}. As discussed, in this case the object
identifier is specialized as a text string giving a relative URI
(URI-local-part as the absolute path on the server serving as the
enforcement point). The permission set is specialized to a single number
*REST-method-set* by the following steps:[¶](#section-3-2){.pilcrow}

-   [The entries in the table that specify the same URI-local-part are
    merged into a single entry that specifies the union of the
    permission sets.[¶](#section-3-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-3.1}
-   [The (non-dynamic) methods in the permission sets are converted into
    their CoAP method numbers, minus
    1.[¶](#section-3-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-3.2}
-   [Dynamic-X permissions are converted into what the number would have
    been for X, plus a Dynamic-Offset that has been chosen as 32 (e.g.,
    35 is the number for Dynamic-DELETE as the number for DELETE is
    3).[¶](#section-3-3.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-3.3}
-   [The set of numbers is converted into a single number
    REST-method-set by taking two to the power of each (decremented)
    method number and computing the inclusive OR of the binary
    representations of all the power
    values.[¶](#section-3-3.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-3.4}

### [5.2.](#section-5.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Registries](#name-registries){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-registries}

For the media types application/aif+cbor and application/aif+json, IANA
has created a subregistry within
\[[IANA.media-type-sub-parameters](#IANA.media-type-sub-parameters){.xref}\]
for the media-type parameters `Toid` and `Tperm`, populated with the
following:[¶](#section-5.2-1){.pilcrow}

[]{#name-new-media-type-parameters}

  Parameter   name              Description/Specification         Reference
  ----------- ----------------- --------------------------------- -----------
  Toid        URI-local-part    local-part of URI                 RFC 9237
  Tperm       REST-method-set   set of REST methods represented   RFC 9237

  : [Table 4](#table-4){.selfRef}: [New Media Type
  Parameters](#name-new-media-type-parameters){.selfRef}

The registration policy is Specification Required
\[[RFC8126](#RFC8126){.xref}\]. The designated expert will engage with
the submitter to ascertain whether the requirements of this document are
addressed:[¶](#section-5.2-3){.pilcrow}

-   [The specifications for `Toid` and `Tperm` need to realize the
    general ideas of unambiguous object identifiers and permission lists
    in the context where the AIF data item is intended to be used, and
    their structure needs to be usable with the intended media types
    (application/aif+cbor and application/aif+json) as identified in the
    specification.[¶](#section-5.2-4.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.2-4.1}
-   [The parameter names need to conform to [Section
    4.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6838#section-4.3){.relref} of
    \[[RFC6838](#RFC6838){.xref}\], but preferably they are in
    \[[KebabCase](#KebabCase){.xref}\] so they can be easily translated
    into names used in APIs with popular programming
    languages.[¶](#section-5.2-4.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.2-4.2}

The designated experts will develop further criteria and guidelines as
needed.[¶](#section-5.2-5){.pilcrow}

IANA has registered Content-Format numbers in the \"CoAP
Content-Formats\" subregistry, within the \"Constrained RESTful
Environments (CoRE) Parameters\" registry
\[[IANA.core-parameters](#IANA.core-parameters){.xref}\], as

## [6.](#section-6){.section-number .selfRef} [Security Considerations](#name-security-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-security-considerations}

The security considerations of \[[RFC7252](#RFC7252){.xref}\] apply when
AIF is used with CoAP; [Section
11.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7252#section-11.1){.relref} of
\[[RFC7252](#RFC7252){.xref}\] specifically applies if complex formats
such as URIs are used for `Toid` or `Tperm`. Some wider issues are
discussed in \[[RFC8576](#RFC8576){.xref}\].[¶](#section-6-1){.pilcrow}

When applying these formats, the referencing specification needs to be
careful to ensure:[¶](#section-6-2){.pilcrow}

-   [that the cryptographic armor employed around this format fulfills
    the referencing specification\'s security objectives and that the
    armor or some additional information included in it with the AIF
    data item (1) unambiguously identifies the subject to which the
    authorizations shall apply and (2) provides any context information
    needed to derive the identity of the object to which authorization
    is being granted from the object identifiers (such as, for the data
    models defined in the present specification, the scheme and
    authority information that is used to construct the full URI),
    and[¶](#section-6-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-6-3.1}
-   [that the types used for `Toid` and `Tperm` provide the appropriate
    granularity and precision so that application requirements on the
    precision of the authorization information are fulfilled and that
    all parties have the same understanding of each `Toid`/`Tperm` pair
    in terms of specified objects (resources) and operations on
    those.[¶](#section-6-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-6-3.2}

For the data formats, the security considerations of
\[[RFC8259](#RFC8259){.xref}\] and \[[RFC8949](#RFC8949){.xref}\]
apply.[¶](#section-6-4){.pilcrow}

A plain implementation of AIF might implement just the basic REST model
as per [Section 2.1](#rest-model){.xref}. If it receives authorizations
that include permissions that use the REST-specific model with dynamic
resource creation ([Section 2.3](#ext-rest-model){.xref}), it needs to
either reject the AIF data item entirely or act only on the permissions
that it does understand. In other words, the semantics underlying an
allow-list as discussed above need to hold here as
well.[¶](#section-6-5){.pilcrow}

An implementation of the REST-specific model with dynamic resource
creation ([Section 2.3](#ext-rest-model){.xref}) needs to carefully keep
track of the dynamically created objects and the subjects to which the
Dynamic-X permissions apply \-- both on the server side to enforce the
permissions and on the client side to know which permissions are
available.[¶](#section-6-6){.pilcrow}
