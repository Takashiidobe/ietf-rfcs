The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) holds occasional workshops
designed to consider long-term issues and strategies for the Internet,
and to suggest future directions for the Internet architecture. This
long-term planning function of the IAB is complementary to the ongoing
engineering efforts performed by working groups of the Internet
Engineering Task Force (IETF).[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

The IAB convened the ESCAPE Workshop to examine some proposed changes to
the Internet and the Web, and their potential effects on the Internet
publishing landscape. Of particular interest was the Web Packaging
proposal from Google, under consideration in the IETF, the W3C\'s Web
Incubator Community Group (WICG), and the Web Hypertext Application
Technology Working Group (WHATWG).[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

In considering these proposals, we heard about both positive effects of
Web Packaging and concerns that it could have significant effects on the
relationship between publishers (e.g., news web sites) and content
aggregators (e.g., search engines and social networks). As such, our
focus was primarily on this relationship, rather than technical
discussion.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

Online publishers do not regularly participate in standards activities
directly. A workshop format was used to solicit input from them. The
workshop had 27 participants from a diverse set of backgrounds,
including a small number of attendees from publishers, one aggregator
(Google), plus representatives from browsers, the Accelerated Mobile
Pages (AMP) community, Content Distribution Networks (CDNs), network
operators, academia, and standards bodies. See the workshop call for
papers \[[CFP](#CFP){.xref}\] for more information and a complete
listing of submissions.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

As intended, the workshop was primarily a forum for discussion, so it
did not reach definite conclusions. Instead, this report is the primary
output of the workshop, as a record of that
discussion.[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}

This report documents the use cases discussed in [Section
2](#usecase){.xref} and explains the interactions between publishers and
aggregators that might be affected by it in [Section
3](#tension){.xref}. [Appendix A](#workshop-details){.xref} includes
more details about the workshop itself. For those unfamiliar with Web
Packaging, [Appendix B](#overview){.xref} provides a summary as
background material.[¶](#section-1-6){.pilcrow}

Much of the workshop concentrated on discussion of the validity and
relative merits of the use cases that might be enabled by Web Packaging.
See [Appendix B](#overview){.xref} for an overview of Web
Packaging.[¶](#section-2-1){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-2.1 .section}
### [2.1.](#section-2.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Instant Navigation](#name-instant-navigation){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-instant-navigation}

The largest use of Web Packaging so far is in Google Search, where
packages are intended to improve the perceived performance of navigation
to pages that are linked from search results when
\"clicked\".[¶](#section-2.1-1){.pilcrow}

To enable this, when a linking (or referring) web page includes links to
pages on another site, it also provides the browser with a packaged copy
of the target content, signed by the origin of the target content. In
effect, the referring page provides a cache for the target page\'s
content. If navigation to one of those links occurs, having the Web
Package gives a browser the assurance that the cache didn\'t change the
content, so it can treat that content as if it were acquired directly
from the server for the target page \-- even though it came from a
different server. In many cases, this results in significantly lower
perceived delay in displaying the target
page.[¶](#section-2.1-2){.pilcrow}

A vital characteristic of this technique is that the browser does not
contact the target site before navigation. The browser does not make any
requests to sites until after navigation occurs, and only then if the
site requires additional content or makes a request
directly.[¶](#section-2.1-3){.pilcrow}

Similar improvements could also be realized by downloading content
(packaged or otherwise) directly from the target site through a
technique called \"prefetching\". However, doing so would reveal
information about the user\'s activity on the linking page to those
sites \-- even when the user never actually navigates to
it.[¶](#section-2.1-4){.pilcrow}

Note: This technique that uses Web Packaging is also referred to as
\"privacy-preserving prefetch\". This document avoids that term as there
was some contention at the workshop about which aspects of privacy might
be preserved by the technique.[¶](#section-2.1-5.1){.pilcrow}

Sites bundled with Web Packaging can additionally be constructed in a
way that ensures that they render without needing any additional network
access. This makes it possible to provide near-instantaneous navigation.
The proposed changes to web navigation in support of loading Web
Packages is designed to support this use
case.[¶](#section-2.1-6){.pilcrow}

Workshop participants recognized the value of web performance for
usability, as well as for business metrics like retention and bounce
rates. Such improvements were seen as a valuable goal, but publishers
raised questions about whether they justified the cost of supporting an
additional format, while others raised concerns about different aspects
of the Web Packaging proposal.[¶](#section-2.1-7){.pilcrow}

### [2.2.](#section-2.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Offline Content Sharing](#name-offline-content-sharing){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-offline-content-sharing}

Another primary use case discussed was the ability to share web content
between devices where neither has an active connection to the Internet.
One of the stated goals of Web Packaging is to enable sharing of content
offline.[¶](#section-2.2-1){.pilcrow}

Several participants reported that in areas where Internet access is
expensive, slow, or intermittent, the use of direct peer-to-peer file
exchange (e.g., \"saving a website and sharing it on a USB stick\") is
commonplace. Most web browsers already have some affordances for this,
but these are recognized as in need of
improvements.[¶](#section-2.2-2){.pilcrow}

In the discussion, several rejected an assumed requirement of this use
case \-- that there be no difference between the treatment of a
\"normal\" web page and that of one loaded from an offline Web
Package.[¶](#section-2.2-3){.pilcrow}

The ability for a Web Package to provide clear attribution for content
was seen as valuable by some participants for a range of reasons.
However, reservations were expressed about the subtleties of the
properties that signatures provide and the effect of this on web
security; see also Sections [4.2](#web-sec){.xref} and
[2.3.2](#archive){.xref}.[¶](#section-2.2-4){.pilcrow}

Many participants pointed out that using \"unsigned bundles\" \-- that
is, Web Packages without signed exchanges \-- could be adequate for this
use case, since most users don\'t need cryptographic proof of the
site\'s identity. However, some expressed concerns that this might
worsen the propagation of falsehood.[¶](#section-2.2-5){.pilcrow}

Some suggested that the value of signed exchanges was not realized in
small-scale interpersonal exchange of information but in the building of
systems for content delivery that might include capabilities like
discovery and automated distribution. The contention here was that
effective use of digital signatures in offline distribution of content
implied considerably more infrastructure than was described in current
proposals.[¶](#section-2.2-6){.pilcrow}

No definite conclusions about offline sharing were reached during the
workshop.[¶](#section-2.2-7){.pilcrow}

### [2.3.](#section-2.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Other Use Cases](#name-other-use-cases){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-other-use-cases}

A session on the second morning concentrated on two other significant
potential use cases for Web Packages: book publishing and Web archiving.
These were not seen as \"primary\" by the proponents of Web Packaging;
the original intent was not to spend significant time on these subjects,
but there was considerable interest from
attendees.[¶](#section-2.3-1){.pilcrow}

::: {#book-publishing}
::: {#section-2.3.1 .section}
#### [2.3.1.](#section-2.3.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Book Publishing](#name-book-publishing){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-book-publishing}

The potential application of a packaging format to book publishing was
discussed, with particular reference to ways that books differ from web
content. Specialists from that industry pointed out that book delivery
can vary greatly from typical web content
delivery.[¶](#section-2.3.1-1){.pilcrow}

Workshop participants briefly explored existing solutions. PDF was seen
as particularly challenging for this use case, due to its limitations,
and EPUB has constraints that also make it challenging for
publishers.[¶](#section-2.3.1-2){.pilcrow}

Although Web Packaging might help to address this use case, the question
of how to identify book content was not resolved. The use of signed
exchanges in this context might offer means of tying content in books to
a website, but several limitations inherent in doing that were
identified.[¶](#section-2.3.1-3){.pilcrow}

In particular, book publication specialists represented that books
don\'t have the same requirements for timeliness or currency as web
pages. For instance, Dave Cramer\'s submission
\[[CRAMER](#CRAMER){.xref}\] observed that Moby Dick was published over
61,000 days ago, which is considerably longer than the proposed limit of
7 days for signed exchanges. The limited length of time that a Web
Package can be considered valid was discussed at some
length.[¶](#section-2.3.1-4){.pilcrow}

Additionally, the risk of a publisher going out of business during the
lifetime of a book is significant, because books \-- at least successful
ones \-- often span generations in their applicability. To that end,
having a means of attributing content to a publisher was considered less
practical and potentially undesirable (much like the discussion above
regarding \"unsigned bundles\").[¶](#section-2.3.1-5){.pilcrow}

There were other aspects of book publication that participants saw as
challenging for packaging. For example, it is currently not understood
what it means to refer to distinct parts of a book. Participants saw
this as an area where providing stable references for bundles of content
might offer possibilities, but nothing concrete came from that
discussion.[¶](#section-2.3.1-6){.pilcrow}

The potential for active content in a bundle to use web APIs to enrich
content or enable new features was considered valuable. Models for
enabling paywalls were discussed at some length (see [Section
5.4](#paywalls){.xref}).[¶](#section-2.3.1-7){.pilcrow}

Web archiving is a complicated discipline that is made more difficult by
the complex nature of the Web itself.[¶](#section-2.3.2-1){.pilcrow}

From an archival standpoint, the potential for web content to be
provided in a self-contained form was viewed positively. Several
improvements to the structure of Web Packaging were considered, such as
providing complete sets of content and the use of Memento
\[[MEMENTO](#RFC7089){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2.3.2-2){.pilcrow}

Though there were potential applications of a packaging scheme, many
challenges were recognized as requiring additional work on the part of
content producers to be fully effective. For example, JavaScript is
needed to render some archived content faithfully, but attributing that
content to an origin in all scenarios is
challenging.[¶](#section-2.3.2-3){.pilcrow}

If packaging were to be widely deployed, it might improve the situation
for archival replay. In particular, the speculation is that there would
be less \"live leakage\" as packaged content might be less likely to
refer to live resources that currently tend to \"leak\" into views of
archives. It was also noted that subresources might also be more likely
to be packaged, especially those that are needed for deferred
representations (i.e., after JavaScript execution on the page or some
user interactions). Other potential applications and enhancements are
discussed in \[[ALAM](#ALAM){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2.3.2-4){.pilcrow}

Participants discussed the use of a signature for non-repudiation at
some length. In one case related to the Internet Archive, a public
figure disputed the accuracy of archived content, asserting that the
original content was modified either at the source or in the
archive.[¶](#section-2.3.2-5){.pilcrow}

Some participants initially saw digital signatures as a way to address
such issues of provenance. As similar problems exist in other areas,
such as in book publication, medical research, and news, a solution to
this problem was considered to have broad
applicability.[¶](#section-2.3.2-6){.pilcrow}

However, the discussion ultimately concluded that providing
non-repudiation in retrospect is challenging. Signing keys are not
expected to remain secure for long periods. If keys are leaked
afterwards, an attacker could retroactively generate fraudulent
signatures. Alternative solutions were discussed, such as providing
independent archives for the same data, using consensus protocols, or
using an append-only construct like a Haber-Stornetta log
\[[AOLOG](#AOLOG){.xref}\], all of which can be used to increase the
difficulty of altering or misrepresenting established
archives.[¶](#section-2.3.2-7){.pilcrow}

## [3.](#section-3){.section-number .selfRef} [Interactions between Web Publishers and Aggregators](#name-interactions-between-web-pu){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-interactions-between-web-pu}

A significant motivation for holding the workshop was to provide a forum
where publishers could discuss the impact of Web Packaging on the online
publishing ecosystem. Of primary interest was whether Web Packages might
effectively enable a transfer of power from publishers to
aggregators.[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

Both publishers and aggregators at the workshop expressed the importance
of maintaining a positive relationship. Publishers in particular
expressed the need to be able to trust that aggregators won\'t
misrepresent their work or de-emphasize it for reasons unrelated to
quality and perceived value to the user.[¶](#section-3-2){.pilcrow}

One key question from \[[BERJON](#BERJON){.xref}\] was
discussed:[¶](#section-3-3){.pilcrow}

> Web Packaging has other uses, but it is primarily seen by a large
> proportion of its stakeholders as a solution to problems that AMP
> created. Before we agree to solve those issues, should we not ask if
> AMP was a useful approach in the first place \-- and useful to
> whom?[¶](#section-3-4){.pilcrow}

In examining this issue, discussion focused on the current incentive
model offered by aggregators. The costs that publishers incur for
participation in that system were considered. Considerable time was
spent on AMP; a summary of that discussion can be found in [Section
5](#conflation){.xref}.[¶](#section-3-5){.pilcrow}

We also considered the question of whether standardizing Web Packaging
confers credibility to aggregators exercising unwelcome control over
publisher content or whether the technical safeguards Web Packaging
provides could allow aggregators to relax their restrictions on the
kinds of content they\'re willing to cache and serve. No conclusions
were drawn.[¶](#section-3-6){.pilcrow}

### [3.1.](#section-3.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Incentives for Web Packages](#name-incentives-for-web-packages){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-incentives-for-web-packages}

Submissions to the workshop indicated that the use of inducements
involving better placement and formatting of links to publisher content
had a significant effect on the uptake of related technology. For
example, in
\[[DEPUYDT-NELSON](#DEPUYDT-NELSON){.xref}\]:[¶](#section-3.1-1){.pilcrow}

> \[\...\] The Washington Post has always placed a great deal of trust
> in Google to represent its content\--and their reward for doing so is
> more traffic, which positively impacts the
> business.[¶](#section-3.1-2){.pilcrow}

During the workshop, several online publishers indicated that if it
weren\'t for the privileged position in the Google Search carousel given
to AMP content, they would not publish in that
format.[¶](#section-3.1-3){.pilcrow}

Publishers that do produce AMP said they see a non-trivial increase in
traffic as a result of deploying AMP content. For example, Yahoo Japan
reported a 60% increase in traffic as a result of deploying AMP on Yahoo
Travel \[[OTSU](#OTSU){.xref}\]. There was no data presented as to
whether this increase was due to better placement in Google Search
results, the inherent benefits of the AMP Cache, or the use of the AMP
format.[¶](#section-3.1-4){.pilcrow}

Anecdotal evidence was offered by another large publisher that saw a 10%
drop in traffic as a result of accidentally disabling AMP content.
However, increases in traffic might not result in similarly proportioned
increases in revenue, as observed in
\[[BREWSTER](#BREWSTER){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3.1-5){.pilcrow}

Several participants pointed out that introducing a new, parallel format
for Web content incurs operational costs. In particular, supporting any
new format \-- such as Web Packaging, Apple News, or Facebook Instant
Articles \-- requires not only initial development of tooling (some
generic and some specific to a site\'s requirements) but also an ongoing
investment in maintaining its operability. Some participants expressed
concern about the impact upon small publishers with limited technical
and financial resources, especially in the current publishing
climate.[¶](#section-3.2-1){.pilcrow}

Increased exposure from new formats might not always justify the added
expense of providing articles in that format
\[[BREWSTER](#BREWSTER){.xref}\]. However, a standardized format might
help publishers reduce the cost of maintaining multiple
formats.[¶](#section-3.2-2){.pilcrow}

The use of Web Packaging as a tool for avoiding censorship was not a
significant topic of discussion, except to note that publishers often
have regulatory requirements regarding removal or correction of
content.[¶](#section-3.3-1){.pilcrow}

Reference was made to the desire to remove videos of a recent shooting
\[[CHRISTCHURCH](#CHRISTCHURCH){.xref}\] and the potential difficulty in
doing so if content were available as Web Packages. Legal requirements
to remove content come from multiple angles: copyright violations,
illegal content, editorial corrections or errors, and right to erasure
provisions in the European Union General Data Protection Regulation
\[[GDPR](#GDPR){.xref}\] were mentioned. One participant speculated that
making it more difficult to remove material in this way might discourage
regulators from censoring content.[¶](#section-3.3-2){.pilcrow}

In this context, participants observed that it would be difficult to
create mechanisms to track and control content served as a Web Package
without compromising the stated goal of censorship
resistance.[¶](#section-3.3-3){.pilcrow}

### [3.4.](#section-3.4){.section-number .selfRef} [Web Performance](#name-web-performance){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-web-performance}

Understanding the effect that Web Packaging might have on web
performance was a matter of some
contention.[¶](#section-3.4-1){.pilcrow}

Some informal analysis from the Google Search deployment was presented
(later published in \[[AMP-PERF](#AMP-PERF){.xref}\]) that showed
significant performance improvements in metrics related to navigation
time resulting from the combination of prefetch, prerendering, and the
AMP format. These results are suggestive of a possibility that Web
Packaging could provide some of that improvement on its own, but no data
was presented that apportioned the improvement among the three
components.[¶](#section-3.4-2){.pilcrow}

Though data was presented to demonstrate potential rather than be a
definitive result, discussions raised a number of questions that suggest
the need for further study. Attendees suggested that future measurements
consider the effect of signed bundles distinct from the enhancements
derived from the AMP format. Future research in this area might also
consider the effectiveness of different strategies on devices with
varying capabilities, bandwidth, power consumption requirements, or
network conditions.[¶](#section-3.4-3){.pilcrow}

Of particular interest is the additional work required to fetch and
render multiple web pages in preparation for navigation. This might
ultimately use fewer connections but comes with an increased network and
CPU cost for clients. Some participants pointed out that different
clients or applications might require different tuning \-- for example,
when users have limited (or expensive) bandwidth or for sites with less
clear knowledge about the use of outbound
links.[¶](#section-3.4-4){.pilcrow}

Workshop participants also expressed interest in learning about the
effect of Web Packages on subsequent navigations within the target
site.[¶](#section-3.4-5){.pilcrow}

In discussion, some participants suggested that their experience
supported a theory that operating a cache at the linking site was most
effective and the additional work done prior to navigation in terms of
fetching and preparing content was what provided the most gains; others
suggested that the benefits inherent in the AMP format was a dominant
factor.[¶](#section-3.4-6){.pilcrow}

Understanding the complete effect of Web Packaging on web performance
will require further work.[¶](#section-3.4-7){.pilcrow}

## [4.](#section-4){.section-number .selfRef} [Systemic Effects](#name-systemic-effects){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-systemic-effects}

It is not straightforward to estimate how a proposed technology change
might affect all of the parts of a system \-- including not only other
components, but also things like end-user rights and the balance of
power between parties \-- ahead of time. To date, when evaluating
proposals, the IETF has generally focused on more immediate concerns,
such as interoperability and security.[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

Moreover, people often find new uses for successful standards
\[[SUCCESS](#RFC5218){.xref}\] after they are deployed. It is rarely
possible to accurately predict all applications of a protocol or format,
whether they are harmful or beneficial. Refusing standardization only
impedes both outcomes.[¶](#section-4-2){.pilcrow}

With the understanding that predictions are difficult to make, there was
considerable speculation at the workshop about the possible effect of
Web Packaging on the Web. Some of that speculation is informed by
experience, but that experience is necessarily limited in scope. This
section attempts to capture that discussion.[¶](#section-4-3){.pilcrow}

::: {#consolidation}
::: {#section-4.1 .section}
### [4.1.](#section-4.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Consolidation](#name-consolidation){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-consolidation}

Concerns about the consolidation of power on the Internet have
significantly increased lately, as a result of several factors. While
the IAB, the Internet Society, and others are examining this phenomenon
to understand it better, it is nevertheless prudent to consider whether
proposals for changes to how the Internet works favors or counters
consolidation. Favoring entities with existing advantages \-- like
resources, size, or market share \-- is not necessarily a factor that
disqualifies a new proposal, but it needs to be considered as a cost of
enabling that technology.[¶](#section-4.1-1){.pilcrow}

Although the outcomes of adopting Web Packaging are unclear, the
workshop revealed several concerns for consolidation risks for all
involved parties: users, publisher sites, linking sites, and services
they each rely on.[¶](#section-4.1-2){.pilcrow}

::: {#consolidation-of-power-in-linking-sites}
::: {#section-4.1.1 .section}
#### [4.1.1.](#section-4.1.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Consolidation of Power in Linking Sites](#name-consolidation-of-power-in-l){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-consolidation-of-power-in-l}

Several participants noted that Web Packaging\'s enabling of instant
navigation ([Section 2.1](#nav){.xref}) might advantage larger linking
sites \-- such as social networks or search engines \-- over smaller
ones in the same industry because doing so requires careful selections
of which links to optimize, so as not to create unneeded
traffic.[¶](#section-4.1.1-1){.pilcrow}

For example, a news article often has many links, but not all of them
are equally likely to be followed. Deciding which ones to prefetch
requires considerable data collection and engineering, so this technique
might not be feasible for smaller entities. Additionally, some
participants noted that this technique favors sites that have a linear
set of ranked links, like search results; it is more difficult to apply
to a page of news (for example) because predicting what link a user will
follow is less obvious.[¶](#section-4.1.1-2){.pilcrow}

This technique also requires access to a cache with terms of use
compatible with the requirements of the site. It was pointed out that
the Google AMP Cache has policies that might be acceptable to many, and
there are other caches. Sites operated by entities other than Google
already use this cache, though it was observed that a site that does not
host its own cache suffers a minor performance
degradation.[¶](#section-4.1.1-3){.pilcrow}

Participants seemed to agree that if performance is a strong enough
differentiator, the effective use of Web Packaging might turn out to be
a condition for success for online publishers. Google Search\'s choice
to privilege content that is served using HTTPS was pointed out as
showing that this sort of influence can be effective. Equally, it is not
necessarily the case that standardization of new capabilities will
affect such policies materially, as noted in
\[[YASSKIN](#YASSKIN){.xref}\]:[¶](#section-4.1.2-1){.pilcrow}

> It seems unlikely that any decisions we make in a packaging or
> distribution system will affect the considerations aggregators use
> when deciding how to rank recommendations or the power this gives them
> over publishers.[¶](#section-4.1.2-2){.pilcrow}

The most common concern raised in the discussion was the effect of this
technology on smaller publishers who might be less able to optimize the
packages they produce, where their primary differentiation in the market
has previously been the quality of their
content.[¶](#section-4.1.2-3){.pilcrow}

In typical operation of the Web, servers have an opportunity to tailor
content to the needs of their users. In contrast, a static Web Package
has few options for individualization, as the content is generated once
and used by many.[¶](#section-4.1.3-1){.pilcrow}

As a result, publishers noted that AMP provides less opportunity to
customize content for their customers. Their concerns included not only
personalizing content based on what they know about the user but also
optimizing the package for specific browsers. Other participants
observed in relation to this that Web Packaging might also have a
consolidating effect in the browser
market.[¶](#section-4.1.3-2){.pilcrow}

Some participants brought up the possibility of customization by
providing multiple packages, including multiple variants of resources in
a single package, or performing customization after the package was
loaded. However, other participants pointed out that all of these
options have negative side effects, either in complexity or reduced
performance arising from larger bundles or delayed
customization.[¶](#section-4.1.3-3){.pilcrow}

### [4.2.](#section-4.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Effect on Web Security](#name-effect-on-web-security){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-effect-on-web-security}

One session explored the impact of introducing a new security model for
the Web. Currently, sites rely on connection-oriented security (provided
by TLS \[[TLS](#RFC8446){.xref}\]), but Web Packaging adds a limited
form of object security. That is, the package protects the integrity of
a message, rather than providing integrity and confidentiality for its
delivery. Object security is not a new concept in the context of the
Web; designs like SHTTP \[[SHTTP](#RFC2660){.xref}\] are as old as
HTTPS. Though the intent is for Web Packaging to have a far more narrow
applicability, it provides fewer security guarantees than HTTPS, since
it provides only authentication, no confidentiality with respect to the
cache, and no assurance of liveness.[¶](#section-4.2-1){.pilcrow}

Object-based security \-- such as proposed in Web Packaging \-- allows
the use of content regardless of how it is obtained; some participants
noted that third parties gain greater control over the distribution of
content, reducing the ability of publishers to retract or alter content
over the validity period of signed content.[¶](#section-4.2-2){.pilcrow}

Another topic of discussion was composition attacks. In its proposed
form, Web Packaging only provides authentication of independent
resources, not a web page as a single unit, allowing an attacker to
control the composition of resources. This weakness was acknowledged as
a known shortcoming of the current proposal that would be
addressed.[¶](#section-4.2-3){.pilcrow}

The issue of managing the trade-off between control and performance in
caches arose. While participants recognized that problems with resource
composition already occur by accident \-- for example, when a cache
stores different versions of resources \-- Web Packaging allows an
attacker more direct control over what resources are available to
clients.[¶](#section-4.2-4){.pilcrow}

For example, an attacker might be able to cause content with a security
flaw to be used up to a week past the time that the defect was
fixed.[¶](#section-4.2-5){.pilcrow}

As an example of how Web Packaging might change the risk profile for
sites, participants discussed recovery from cross-site scripting
attacks. It is already the case that a brief exposure to this class of
attack can result in an attacker gaining persistent access, but
mechanisms exist that can be used to avoid or correct issues, like cache
validation and Clear Site Data \[[CLEAR-DATA](#CLEAR-DATA){.xref}\].
These measures are not available to clients unless they connect to the
site.[¶](#section-4.2-6){.pilcrow}

The discussion pointed out that these concerns are not new or uniquely
enabled by Web Packaging. However, it was pointed out that new features
are routinely subject to higher security and privacy expectations. In an
example unrelated to Web Packaging but with similar trade-offs, shared
compression of multiple resources has significant performance benefits.
The risk with shared compression is the potential for exposing encrypted
information through side channels. Though sites can use shared
compression without this exposure, shared compression will likely only
be enabled once it is clear that measures to prevent accidental
information exposure are understood to be effective in a broad set of
deployments.[¶](#section-4.2-7){.pilcrow}

The discussion also addressed the question of whether concerns might
equally apply to the typical use of a CDN as a third-party provider of
the content. Some participants concluded that CDNs are typically in a
contractual relationship with the sites they serve and so are more
likely to have their interests aligned.[¶](#section-4.2-8){.pilcrow}

### [4.3.](#section-4.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Privacy of Content](#name-privacy-of-content){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-privacy-of-content}

Discussion and submissions raised concerns regarding how serving content
using Web Packages might adversely affect privacy of individuals. There
are challenges here, but the very narrow applicability of Web Packaging
to what is effectively static content limits the privacy risk. The
conclusion was that, provided sufficient care is taken in
implementation, the use of Web Packages does not substantially increase
the information that an aggregator gains about what content is
consumed.[¶](#section-4.3-1){.pilcrow}

Concretely, an aggregator knows what content it serves in anticipation
of navigation. This is \-- at least in theory \-- substantially the same
as the content that the aggregator might receive if it performed the
navigation itself. Assuming that content is stripped of personalization,
the aggregator gains no new information.[¶](#section-4.3-2){.pilcrow}

On multiple occasions, discussion at the workshop concentrated on
problems that arise as a result of constraints on the AMP format or
details of its inclusion in Google Search. For instance, the requirement
to make pages expose their metadata is unlikely to be affected by any
standardization of a packaging format as that requirement is independent
of the process of delivering content.[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

This section provides some detail on aspects of the discussion that
touched on AMP more generally in this way. Some treatment of these
points is considered relevant as some of the discussion at the workshop,
even under the remit of discussing Web Packaging, concentrated on the
effect of AMP on the ecosystem.[¶](#section-5-2){.pilcrow}

Note: Of the four formats mentioned in the workshop call for papers
\[[CFP](#CFP){.xref}\], only AMP sent representatives to the workshop.
The discussion was therefore concentrated around AMP; this section
should not be read to imply anything about other
formats.[¶](#section-5-3.1){.pilcrow}

Discussion and submissions referred to a commitment
\[[AMP-LESSONS](#AMP-LESSONS){.xref}\] to allow publishers to use
content that met specific criteria to access privileged positions in
search results, regardless of their adoption of AMP. Participants felt
that this approach might address some of these concerns if it were
adopted and durable. For instance, the use of Web Packaging might be
sufficient to remove some constraints on active content on the basis
that the active content would be attributed to the publisher and not the
AMP Cache.[¶](#section-5-4){.pilcrow}

### [5.1.](#section-5.1){.section-number .selfRef} [AMP Governance](#name-amp-governance){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-amp-governance}

There was interest from workshop participants in the governance model
used for AMP. In particular, the question of how independent the AMP
project would be of Google and Google Search
arose.[¶](#section-5.1-1){.pilcrow}

Three of the seven members of the AMP Technical Steering Committee, the
body that governs AMP, are Google employees, which gives Google
considerable influence over the project. It was asserted that the
governance structure was intended to be more independent of Google over
time. The understanding was that any consumer of the format, such as
Google Search, would make an independent assessment about whether to use
or require different aspects of the AMP project
products.[¶](#section-5.1-2){.pilcrow}

Sites often implement AMP by creating a separate set of content in
parallel to their regular HTML content. Publishers noted this as a high
cost, particularly for smaller sites. It was pointed out that websites
can serve AMP-compliant content exclusively. However, several publishers
referred to limitations in the format that made it unsuitable for their
needs.[¶](#section-5.2-1){.pilcrow}

Many cited reasons for this duplication were related to the necessity of
running arbitrary active content (typically, JavaScript). For
example:[¶](#section-5.2-2){.pilcrow}

-   [AMP provides a framework for supporting user authentication, but
    publishers asserted that using this framework was not considered
    practical.[¶](#section-5.2-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.2-3.1}
-   [AMP content does not support rendering of certain content, which
    can affect the ability of publishers to innovate content

-   [The AMP model for the implementation of paywalls ([Section
    5.4](#paywalls){.xref}) was claimed to be inimical to some publisher
    business models.[¶](#section-5.2-3.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.2-3.3}

More broadly, they considered AMP\'s constraints on the use of active
content as problematic, since they prevent the use of capabilities that
are provided on equivalent non-AMP pages. Reference was made to a
proposed \<amp-script> element \-- which has since been made fully
available \-- that seeks to provide limited access to some dynamic
content.[¶](#section-5.2-4){.pilcrow}

Publishers observed that using the AMP format does not provide any
guarantee of performance gains and, in some cases, could contribute to
performance degradation. It was suggested that this was most problematic
for sites that are already well-tuned for
performance.[¶](#section-5.3-1){.pilcrow}

### [5.4.](#section-5.4){.section-number .selfRef} [Implementation of Paywalls](#name-implementation-of-paywalls){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-implementation-of-paywalls}

The use of paywalls by web publishers to control access to content in
return for payment is increasingly common. One popular approach is to
offer a limited number of articles without payment while insisting on a
paid subscription to access further
articles.[¶](#section-5.4-1){.pilcrow}

On several occasions, participants expressed dissatisfaction with the
difficulty of integrating paywall authorization when using AMP. In
particular, they said AMP encourages publishers to include an article\'s
full content, hidden by default but easily accessible to motivated
users. The discussion extended to workarounds like cookie syncing
\[[COOKIE-SYNC](#COOKIE-SYNC){.xref}\], which is used as part of
authorization and is a consequence of having cached content hosted on
the linking site rather than the target
site.[¶](#section-5.4-2){.pilcrow}

The same topic came up concerning book publication, where publishers
indicated that having a means of enabling different methods of
distribution without also facilitating unconstrained copying of book
content was necessary.[¶](#section-5.4-3){.pilcrow}

This conflation of AMP issues with those addressed by Web Packaging was
recurrent in the discussion. As observed in \[[DAS](#DAS){.xref}\],
these concerns might be addressed by linking to a signed
bundle.[¶](#section-5.4-4){.pilcrow}

## [Appendix B.](#section-appendix.b){.section-number .selfRef} [Web Packaging Overview](#name-web-packaging-overview){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-web-packaging-overview}

Web Packaging is comprised of two separate technologies: resource
bundling \[[BUNDLE](#I-D.yasskin-wpack-bundled-exchanges){.xref}\] and
signed exchanges
\[[SXG](#I-D.yasskin-http-origin-signed-responses){.xref}\].[¶](#section-appendix.b-1){.pilcrow}

In both the submissions and workshop discussion, the most controversial
aspect of the technology is the use of signed exchanges as an
alternative means of providing authority over a particular resource, for
a few different reasons.[¶](#section-appendix.b-2){.pilcrow}

This appendix explains how authority works on the Web and how Web
Packaging proposes to change that.[¶](#section-appendix.b-3){.pilcrow}

::: {#authority-in-https}
::: {#section-b.1 .section}
## [B.1.](#section-b.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Authority in HTTPS](#name-authority-in-https){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-authority-in-https}

The Web currently uses HTTPS \[[HTTP](#RFC7230){.xref}\] to establish a
server\'s authority \-- that is, to give an assurance that the content
came from where the URL implies. The combination of URI scheme (https),
domain name (or host), and port number are formed into a single
identifier, the origin \[[ORIGIN](#RFC6454){.xref}\] to which content is
attributed.[¶](#section-b.1-1){.pilcrow}

Web browsers use the certificate offered as part of a TLS connection
\[[TLS](#RFC8446){.xref}\] to servers in determining whether a server is
authoritative for that origin; see \[[ORIGIN](#RFC6454){.xref}\] and
[Section
9.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7230#section-9.1){.relref} of
\[[HTTP](#RFC7230){.xref}\]. Content is attributed to a given URL only
if it is received from a connection to a server that is authoritative
for the associated origin.[¶](#section-b.1-2){.pilcrow}

As an example, a web browser seeking to load
`https://example.com/index.html` makes a TLS connection to a server. As
part of the TLS connection establishment, the server offers a
certificate for the name `example.com`. If the browser accepts the
certificate, it will then make requests for URLs on the
`https://example.com` origin on that connection and consider any answers
from the server to be authoritative.[¶](#section-b.1-3){.pilcrow}

This notion of authority is a crucial property of web security: only
content that is attributed to the same web origin can access all
information in that origin, including the content of most resources as
well as state associated with the origin, such as cookies. This
separation ensures that sites can keep secrets from each other, even
when they are both loaded in the same
browser.[¶](#section-b.1-4){.pilcrow}
:::
:::

::: {#authority-in-web-packaging}
::: {#section-b.2 .section}
## [B.2.](#section-b.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Authority in Web Packaging](#name-authority-in-web-packaging){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-authority-in-web-packaging}

Web Packaging, through the use of signed exchanges, aims to provide an
alternative means of establishing authority. A signed exchange is an
expression of an HTTP request and response (an exchange) with certain
information stripped and a digital signature
applied.[¶](#section-b.2-1){.pilcrow}

The signature is made with a similar certificate to the one a server
might offer in HTTPS \-- that certificate can also be used for HTTPS \--
but it includes a special attribute that denotes its suitability for
signed exchanges.[¶](#section-b.2-2){.pilcrow}

A web browser that has been provided with a signed exchange can verify
the signature and, if the signature is valid and the certificate is
acceptable, use the content from the signed exchange. Critically, the
web browser does not make an HTTPS connection to a server to get the
content or to verify the signature.[¶](#section-b.2-3){.pilcrow}

In effect, Web Packaging moves from a model where authority is derived
from the delivery method (i.e., TLS) to an object security model, where
authority is derived from a signature on objects. In doing so, it aims
to render the means of delivery irrelevant to determinations of
security.[¶](#section-b.2-4){.pilcrow}

::: {#applicability}
::: {#section-b.3 .section}
## [B.3.](#section-b.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Applicability](#name-applicability){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-applicability}

Web Packaging does not claim to supplant the authority model of the Web
completely, but it does provide an alternative that might be used under
certain narrow conditions. In particular, Web Packaging is intended for
use with content that is not secret from an entity that is aware of the
existence of that content.[¶](#section-b.3-1){.pilcrow}

In aid of this goal, Web Packaging does not include information from
exchanges that is related to the process of acquiring content nor does
it include any information that is related to individual requests. For
instance, use of the Set-Cookie header field is expressly forbidden, as
it often contains information that is related to a particular
user.[¶](#section-b.3-2){.pilcrow}

::: {#the-amp-format-google-search-results-and-web-packaging}
::: {#section-b.4 .section}
## [B.4.](#section-b.4){.section-number .selfRef} [The AMP Format, Google Search Results, and Web Packaging](#name-the-amp-format-google-searc){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-the-amp-format-google-searc}

The relationship between the AMP Project \<<https://amp.dev/>\> and Web
Packaging is complicated. The AMP Project, sponsored by Google,
establishes a profile of HTML with a stated goal of providing support
for the best practices for the format, with a strong emphasis on
performance. The format tightly constrains the use of HTML features but
also offers a library of components that provide sanitized
implementations of many commonly used
capabilities.[¶](#section-b.4-1){.pilcrow}

The connection to Web Packaging is bound up in the way that Google
Search treats AMP content specially. AMP content provides two properties
that Google Search exploits: metadata exposure and static analysis of
active content.[¶](#section-b.4-2){.pilcrow}

AMP content provides metadata in a form that can be reliably extracted,
using the microformats defined by the Schema.org project
\<<https://schema.org/>\>. This aspect of AMP has no effect on the
discussion, except to the extent that this relates to Google Search and
their use of this metadata in populating the
carousel.[¶](#section-b.4-3){.pilcrow}

Constrained use of active content \-- such as JavaScript \-- in AMP
makes it possible to analyze content to verify that actions taken are
narrowly limited. This static analysis assures that AMP content can be
served without affecting other content on the same site. For Google
Search, this is what enables the loading of AMP content alongside search
content and other AMP resources.[¶](#section-b.4-4){.pilcrow}

To provide preloading, Google operates the Google AMP Cache
\<<https://developers.google.com/amp/cache/>\>, from which AMP content
is served. As a consequence, browsers attribute the content to the
origin \[[ORIGIN](#RFC6454){.xref}\] of the AMP Cache and not the
publisher, creating some confusion about how content is attributed, as
discussed in the W3C finding on distributed content
\[[TAG-DC](#TAG-DC){.xref}\].[¶](#section-b.4-5){.pilcrow}

An important goal of Web Packaging is to attribute content loaded from a
