# RFC 9168 {#rfcnum}

# Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) Extension for Flow Specification {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

The Path Computation Element (PCE) is a functional component capable of
selecting paths through a traffic engineering (TE) network. These paths
may be supplied in response to requests for computation or may be
unsolicited requests issued by the PCE to network elements. Both
approaches use the PCE Communication Protocol (PCEP) to convey the
details of the computed path.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

Traffic flows may be categorized and described using \"Flow
Specifications\". RFC 8955 defines the Flow Specification and describes
how Flow Specification components are used to describe traffic flows.
RFC 8955 also defines how Flow Specifications may be distributed in BGP
to allow specific traffic flows to be associated with
routes.[¶](#section-abstract-2){.pilcrow}

This document specifies a set of extensions to PCEP to support
dissemination of Flow Specifications. This allows a PCE to indicate what
traffic should be placed on each path that it is aware
of.[¶](#section-abstract-3){.pilcrow}

The extensions defined in this document include the creation, update,
and withdrawal of Flow Specifications via PCEP and can be applied to
tunnels initiated by the PCE or to tunnels where control is delegated to
the PCE by the Path Computation Client (PCC). Furthermore, a PCC
requesting a new path can include Flow Specifications in the request to
indicate the purpose of the tunnel allowing the PCE to factor this into
the path computation.[¶](#section-abstract-4){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC4655](#RFC4655){.xref}\] defines the Path Computation Element
(PCE), a functional component capable of computing paths for use in
traffic engineering networks. PCE was originally conceived for use in
Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) for traffic engineering (TE)
networks to derive the routes of Label Switched Paths (LSPs). However,
the scope of PCE was quickly extended to make it applicable to networks
controlled by Generalized MPLS (GMPLS), and more recent work has brought
other traffic engineering technologies and planning applications into
scope (for example, Segment Routing (SR)
\[[RFC8664](#RFC8664){.xref}\]).[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC5440](#RFC5440){.xref}\] describes the PCE Communication Protocol
(PCEP). PCEP defines the communication between a Path Computation Client
(PCC) and a PCE, or between PCE and PCE, enabling computation of the
path for MPLS-TE LSPs.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

Stateful PCE \[[RFC8231](#RFC8231){.xref}\] specifies a set of
extensions to PCEP to enable control of TE-LSPs by a PCE that retains
state about the LSPs provisioned in the network (a stateful PCE).
\[[RFC8281](#RFC8281){.xref}\] describes the setup, maintenance, and
teardown of LSPs initiated by a stateful PCE without the need for local
configuration on the PCC, thus allowing for a dynamic network that is
centrally controlled. \[[RFC8283](#RFC8283){.xref}\] introduces the
architecture for PCE as a central controller and describes how PCE can
be viewed as a component that performs computation to place \"flows\"
within the network and decide how these flows are
routed.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

The description of traffic flows by the combination of multiple Flow
Specification components and their dissemination as traffic flow
specifications (Flow Specifications) is described for BGP in
\[[RFC8955](#RFC8955){.xref}\]. In BGP, a Flow Specification is
comprised of traffic filtering rules and is associated with actions to
perform on the packets that match the Flow Specification. The BGP
routers that receive a Flow Specification can classify received packets
according to the traffic filtering rules and can direct packets based on
the associated actions.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

When a PCE is used to initiate tunnels (such as TE-LSPs or SR paths)
using PCEP, it is important that the head end of the tunnels understands
what traffic to place on each tunnel. The data flows intended for a
tunnel can be described using Flow Specification components. When PCEP
is in use for tunnel initiation, it makes sense for that same protocol
to be used to distribute the Flow Specification components that describe
what data is to flow on those tunnels.[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}

This document specifies a set of extensions to PCEP to support
dissemination of Flow Specification components. We term the description
of a traffic flow using Flow Specification components as a \"Flow
Specification\". This term is conceptually the same as the term used in
\[[RFC8955](#RFC8955){.xref}\]; however, no mechanism is provided to
distribute an action associated with the Flow Specification because
there is only one action that is applicable in the PCEP context (that
is, directing the matching traffic to the identified
LSP).[¶](#section-1-6){.pilcrow}

The extensions defined in this document include the creation, update,
and withdrawal of Flow Specifications via PCEP and can be applied to
tunnels initiated by the PCE or to tunnels where control is delegated to
the PCE by the PCC. Furthermore, a PCC requesting a new path can include
Flow Specifications in the request to indicate the purpose of the tunnel
allowing the PCE to factor this into the path
computation.[¶](#section-1-7){.pilcrow}

Flow Specifications are carried in TLVs within a new object called the
FLOWSPEC object defined in this document. The flow filtering rules
indicated by the Flow Specifications are mainly defined by BGP Flow
Specifications.[¶](#section-1-8){.pilcrow}

Note that PCEP-installed Flow Specifications are intended to be
installed only at the head end of the LSP to which they direct traffic.
It is acceptable (and potentially desirable) that other routers in the
network have Flow Specifications installed that match the same traffic
but direct it onto different routes or to different LSPs. Those other
Flow Specifications may be installed using the PCEP extensions defined
in this document, distributed using BGP per
\[[RFC8955](#RFC8955){.xref}\], or configured using manual operations.
Since this document is about PCEP-installed Flow Specifications, those
other Flow Specifications at other routers are out of scope. In this
context, however, it is worth noting that changes to the wider routing
system (such as the distribution and installation of BGP Flow
Specifications, or fluctuations in the IGP link state database) might
mean that traffic matching the PCEP Flow Specification never reaches the
head end of the LSP at which the PCEP Flow Specification has been
installed. This may or may not be desirable according to the operator\'s
traffic engineering and routing policies and is particularly applicable
at LSPs that do not have their head ends at the ingress edge of the
network, but it is not an effect that this document seeks to
address.[¶](#section-1-9){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC8174](#RFC8174){.xref}\] when, and only when, they appear in all
capitals, as shown here.[¶](#section-2-1){.pilcrow}

This document uses the following terms defined in
\[[RFC5440](#RFC5440){.xref}\]: PCC, PCE, and PCEP
Peer.[¶](#section-2-2){.pilcrow}

The following term from \[[RFC8955](#RFC8955){.xref}\] is used
frequently throughout this document:[¶](#section-2-3){.pilcrow}

> A Flow Specification is an n-tuple consisting of several matching
> criteria that can be applied to IP traffic. A given IP packet is said
> to match the defined Flow Specification if it matches all the
> specified criteria.[¶](#section-2-4){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC8955](#RFC8955){.xref}\] also states that \"\[a\] given Flow
Specification may be associated with a set of attributes\" and that
\"\...attributes can be used to encode a set of predetermined actions.\"
However, in the context of this document, no action is explicitly
specified as associated with the Flow Specification since the action of
forwarding all matching traffic onto the associated path is
implicit.[¶](#section-2-5){.pilcrow}

How an implementation decides to filter traffic that matches a Flow
Specification does not form part of this specification, but a flag is
provided to indicate whether the sender of a PCEP message that includes
a Flow Specification intends it to be installed as a Longest Prefix
Match (LPM) route or as a Flow Specification
policy.[¶](#section-2-6){.pilcrow}

This document uses the terms \"stateful PCE\" and \"active PCE\" as
advocated in \[[RFC7399](#RFC7399){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2-7){.pilcrow}

In the PCE architecture, there are five steps in the setup and use of
LSPs:[¶](#section-3.1-1){.pilcrow}

1.  [Decide which LSPs to set up. The decision may be made by a user, by
    a PCC, or by the PCE. There can be a number of triggers for this,
    including user intervention and dynamic response to changes in
    traffic demands.[¶](#section-3.1-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.1-2.1}
2.  [Decide what properties to assign to an LSP. This can include
    bandwidth reservations, priorities, and the Differentiated Services
    Code Point (DSCP) (i.e., MPLS Traffic Class field). This function is
    also determined by user configuration or in response to predicted or
    observed traffic
    demands.[¶](#section-3.1-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.1-2.2}
3.  [Decide what traffic to put on the LSP. This is effectively
    determining which traffic flows to assign to which LSPs;
    practically, this is closely linked to the first two decisions
    listed above.[¶](#section-3.1-2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.1-2.3}
4.  [Cause the LSP to be set up and modified to have the right
    characteristics. This will usually involve the PCE advising or
    instructing the PCC at the head end of the LSP, and the PCC will
    then signal the LSP across the
    network.[¶](#section-3.1-2.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.1-2.4}
5.  [Tell the head end of the LSP what traffic to put on the LSP. This
    may happen after or at the same time as the LSP is set up. This step
    is the subject of this
    document.[¶](#section-3.1-2.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.1-2.5}

### [3.2.](#section-3.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Elements of the Procedure](#name-elements-of-the-procedure){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-elements-of-the-procedure}

There are three elements in the procedure:[¶](#section-3.2-1){.pilcrow}

1.  [A PCE and a PCC must be able to indicate whether or not they
    support the use of Flow
    Specifications.[¶](#section-3.2-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.2-2.1}
2.  [A PCE or PCC must be able to include Flow Specifications in PCEP
    messages with a clear understanding of the applicability of those
    Flow Specifications in each case. This includes whether the use of
    such information is mandatory, constrained, or optional and how
    overlapping Flow Specifications will be
    resolved.[¶](#section-3.2-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.2-2.2}
3.  [Flow Specification information/state must be synchronized between
    PCEP peers so that, on recovery, the peers have the same

#### [3.2.1.](#section-3.2.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Capability Advertisement](#name-capability-advertisement){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-capability-advertisement}

##### [3.2.1.1.](#section-3.2.1.1){.section-number .selfRef} [PCEP Open Message](#name-pcep-open-message){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-pcep-open-message}

During PCEP session establishment, a PCC or PCE that supports the
procedures described in this document announces this fact by including
the PCE FlowSpec Capability TLV (described in [Section 4](#cap){.xref})
in the OPEN object carried in the PCEP Open
message.[¶](#section-3.2.1.1-1){.pilcrow}

The presence of the PCE FlowSpec Capability TLV in the OPEN object in a
PCE\'s Open message indicates that the PCE can distribute FlowSpecs to
PCCs and can receive FlowSpecs in messages from
PCCs.[¶](#section-3.2.1.1-2){.pilcrow}

The presence of the PCE FlowSpec Capability TLV in the OPEN object in a
PCC\'s Open message indicates that the PCC supports the FlowSpec
functionality described in this
document.[¶](#section-3.2.1.1-3){.pilcrow}

If either one of a pair of PCEP peers does not include the PCE FlowSpec
Capability TLV in the OPEN object in its Open message, then the other
peer [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} include a FLOWSPEC object in any PCEP message
sent to the peer. If a FLOWSPEC object is received when support has not
been indicated, the receiver will respond with a PCErr message reporting
the objects containing the FlowSpec as described in
\[[RFC5440](#RFC5440){.xref}\]: that is, it will use \"Unknown Object\"
if it does not support this specification and \"Not supported object\"
if it supports this specification but has not chosen to support FLOWSPEC
objects on this PCEP session.[¶](#section-3.2.1.1-4){.pilcrow}

The ability to advertise support for PCEP and PCE features in IGP
advertisements is provided for OSPF in \[[RFC5088](#RFC5088){.xref}\]
and for IS-IS in \[[RFC5089](#RFC5089){.xref}\]. The mechanism uses the
PCE Discovery TLV, which has a PCE-CAP-FLAGS sub-TLV containing bit
flags, each of which indicates support for a different
feature.[¶](#section-3.2.1.2-1){.pilcrow}

This document defines a new PCE-CAP-FLAGS sub-TLV bit, the FlowSpec
Capable flag (bit number 16). Setting the bit indicates that an
advertising PCE supports the procedures defined in this
document.[¶](#section-3.2.1.2-2){.pilcrow}

Note that while PCE FlowSpec capability may be advertised during
discovery, PCEP speakers that wish to use Flow Specification in PCEP
[MUST]{.bcp14} negotiate PCE FlowSpec capability during PCEP session
setup, as specified in [Section 3.2.1.1](#open){.xref}. A PCC
[MAY]{.bcp14} initiate PCE FlowSpec capability negotiation at PCEP
session setup even if it did not receive any IGP PCE capability
advertisement, and a PCEP peer that advertised support for FlowSpec in
the IGP is not obliged to support these procedures on any given PCEP
session.[¶](#section-3.2.1.2-3){.pilcrow}

#### [3.2.2.](#section-3.2.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Dissemination Procedures](#name-dissemination-procedures){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-dissemination-procedures}

This section describes the procedures to support Flow Specifications in
PCEP messages.[¶](#section-3.2.2-1){.pilcrow}

The primary purpose of distributing Flow Specification information is to
allow a PCE to indicate to a PCC what traffic it should place on a path
(such as an LSP or an SR path). This means that the Flow Specification
may be included in:[¶](#section-3.2.2-2){.pilcrow}

-   [PCInitiate messages so that an active PCE can indicate the traffic
    to place on a path at the time that the PCE instantiates the
    path.[¶](#section-3.2.2-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.2.2-3.1}
-   [PCUpd messages so that an active PCE can indicate or change the
    traffic to place on a path that has already been set
    up.[¶](#section-3.2.2-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.2.2-3.2}
-   [PCRpt messages so that a PCC can report the traffic that the PCC
    will place on the
    path.[¶](#section-3.2.2-3.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.2.2-3.3}
-   [PCReq messages so that a PCC can indicate what traffic it plans to
    place on a path when it requests that the PCE perform a computation
    in case that information aids the PCE in its
    work.[¶](#section-3.2.2-3.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.2.2-3.4}
-   [PCRep messages so that a PCE that has been asked to compute a path
    can suggest which traffic could be placed on a path that a PCC may
    be about to set
    up.[¶](#section-3.2.2-3.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.2.2-3.5}
-   [PCErr messages so that issues related to paths and the traffic they
    carry can be reported to the PCE by the PCC and problems with other
    PCEP messages that carry Flow Specifications can be
    reported.[¶](#section-3.2.2-3.6){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.2.2-3.6}

To carry Flow Specifications in PCEP messages, this document defines a
new PCEP object called the \"PCEP FLOWSPEC object\". The object is
[OPTIONAL]{.bcp14} in the messages described above and [MAY]{.bcp14}
appear more than once in each message.[¶](#section-3.2.2-4){.pilcrow}

To describe a traffic flow, the PCEP FLOWSPEC object carries a Flow
Filter TLV.[¶](#section-3.2.2-5){.pilcrow}

The inclusion of multiple PCEP FLOWSPEC objects allows multiple traffic
flows to be placed on a single path.[¶](#section-3.2.2-6){.pilcrow}

Once a PCE and PCC have established that they can both support the use
of Flow Specifications in PCEP messages, such information may be
exchanged at any time for new or existing
paths.[¶](#section-3.2.2-7){.pilcrow}

The application and prioritization of Flow Specifications are described
in [Section 8.7](#priorities){.xref}.[¶](#section-3.2.2-8){.pilcrow}

As per \[[RFC8231](#RFC8231){.xref}\], any attributes of the path
received from a PCE are subject to the PCC\'s local policy. This holds
true for the Flow Specifications as well.[¶](#section-3.2.2-9){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-3.2.3 .section}
#### [3.2.3.](#section-3.2.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Flow Specification Synchronization](#name-flow-specification-synchron){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-flow-specification-synchron}

The Flow Specifications are carried along with the LSP state information
as per \[[RFC8231](#RFC8231){.xref}\], making the Flow Specifications
part of the LSP database (LSP-DB). Thus, the synchronization of the Flow
Specification information is done as part of LSP-DB synchronization.
This may be achieved using normal state synchronization procedures as
described in \[[RFC8231](#RFC8231){.xref}\] or enhanced state
synchronization procedures as defined in
\[[RFC8232](#RFC8232){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3.2.3-1){.pilcrow}

The approach selected will be implementation and deployment specific and
will depend on issues such as how the databases are constructed and what
level of synchronization support is
needed.[¶](#section-3.2.3-2){.pilcrow}

Type values are chosen so that there can be commonality with Flow

message with Error-Type 30 (FlowSpec Error) and Error-value 2 (Malformed

An implementation that receives a PCEP message carrying a Flow
Specification TLV with a type value that it does not recognize or
support [MUST]{.bcp14} respond with a PCErr message with Error-Type 30
(FlowSpec Error) and Error-value 1 (Unsupported FlowSpec) and [MUST
NOT]{.bcp14} install the Flow Specification.[¶](#section-7-7){.pilcrow}

When used in other protocols (such as BGP), these Flow Specifications
are also associated with actions to indicate how traffic matching the
Flow Specification should be treated. In PCEP, however, the only action
is to associate the traffic with a tunnel and to forward matching
traffic onto that path, so no encoding of an action is
needed.[¶](#section-7-8){.pilcrow}

[Section 8.7](#priorities){.xref} describes how overlapping Flow
Specifications are prioritized and handled.[¶](#section-7-9){.pilcrow}

All Flow Specification TLVs with Types in the range 0 to 255 have values
defined for use in BGP (for example, in \[[RFC8955](#RFC8955){.xref}\]
and \[[RFC8956](#RFC8956){.xref}\]) and are set using the BGP encoding
but without the type octet (the relevant information is in the Type
field of the TLV). The Value field is padded with trailing zeros to
achieve 4-byte alignment.[¶](#section-7-10){.pilcrow}

This document defines the following new
types:[¶](#section-7-11){.pilcrow}

Although it may be possible to describe a multicast Flow Specification
from the combination of other Flow Specification TLVs with specific
values, it is more convenient to use a dedicated Flow Specification TLV.
Flow Specification TLVs with Type values 257 and 258 are used to
identify a multicast flow for IPv4 and IPv6, respectively. The Value

The address fields and address mask lengths of the two Multicast Flow
Specification TLVs contain source and group prefixes for matching
against packet flows. Note that the two address fields are 32 bits for
an IPv4 Multicast Flow and 128 bits for an IPv6 Multicast
Flow.[¶](#section-7-18){.pilcrow}

The Reserved field [MUST]{.bcp14} be set to zero and ignored on
receipt.[¶](#section-7-19){.pilcrow}

Two bit flags (S and G) are defined to describe the multicast
wildcarding in use. If the S bit is set, then source wildcarding is in
use, and the values in the Source Mask Length and Source Address fields
[MUST]{.bcp14} be ignored. If the G bit is set, then group wildcarding
is in use, and the values in the Group Mask Length and Group multicast
Address fields [MUST]{.bcp14} be ignored. The G bit [MUST NOT]{.bcp14}
be set unless the S bit is also set: if a Multicast Flow Specification
TLV is received with S bit = 0 and G bit = 1, the receiver
[MUST]{.bcp14} respond with a PCErr with Error-Type 30 (FlowSpec Error)
and Error-value 2 (Malformed FlowSpec).[¶](#section-7-20){.pilcrow}

The three multicast mappings may be achieved as
follows:[¶](#section-7-21){.pilcrow}

The default behavior is that no Flow Specification is applied to a
tunnel. That is, the default is that the FLOWSPEC object is not used, as
is the case in all systems before the implementation of this
specification.[¶](#section-8.1-1){.pilcrow}

In this case, it is a local matter (such as through configuration) how
tunnel head ends are instructed in terms of what traffic to place on a
tunnel.[¶](#section-8.1-2){.pilcrow}

Flow Specifications may be represented by a single Flow Specification
TLV or may require a more complex description using multiple Flow
Specification TLVs. For example, a flow indicated by a
source-destination pair of IPv6 addresses would be described by the
combination of Destination IPv6 Prefix and Source IPv6 Prefix Flow
Specification TLVs.[¶](#section-8.2-1){.pilcrow}

### [8.3.](#section-8.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Modifying Flow Specifications](#name-modifying-flow-specificatio){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-modifying-flow-specificatio}

A PCE may want to modify a Flow Specification associated with a tunnel,
or a PCC may want to report a change to the Flow Specification it is
using with a tunnel.[¶](#section-8.3-1){.pilcrow}

It is important to identify the specific Flow Specification so it is
clear that this is a modification of an existing flow and not the
addition of a new flow as described in [Section 8.4](#multiple){.xref}.
The FS-ID field of the PCEP FLOWSPEC object is used to identify a
specific Flow Specification in the context of the content of the Speaker
Entity Identifier TLV.[¶](#section-8.3-2){.pilcrow}

When modifying a Flow Specification, all Flow Specification TLVs for the
intended specification of the flow [MUST]{.bcp14} be included in the
PCEP FLOWSPEC object. The FS-ID [MUST]{.bcp14} be retained from the
previous description of the flow, and the same Speaker Entity Identifier
TLV [MUST]{.bcp14} be used.[¶](#section-8.3-3){.pilcrow}

### [8.4.](#section-8.4){.section-number .selfRef} [Multiple Flow Specifications](#name-multiple-flow-specification){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-multiple-flow-specification}

It is possible that traffic from multiple flows will be placed on a
single tunnel. In some cases, it is possible to define these within a
single PCEP FLOWSPEC object by widening the scope of a Flow
Specification TLV: for example, traffic to two destination IPv4 prefixes
might be captured by a single Flow Specification TLV with type
\"Destination\" with a suitably adjusted prefix. However, this is
unlikely to be possible in most scenarios, and it must be recalled that
it is not permitted to include two Flow Specification TLVs of the same
type within one Flow Filter TLV.[¶](#section-8.4-1){.pilcrow}

The normal procedure, therefore, is to carry each Flow Specification in
its own PCEP FLOWSPEC object. Multiple objects may be present on a
single PCEP message, or multiple PCEP messages may be
used.[¶](#section-8.4-2){.pilcrow}

The Remove bit in the PCEP FLOWSPEC object is left clear when a Flow
Specification is being added or modified.[¶](#section-8.5-1){.pilcrow}

To remove a Flow Specification, a PCEP FLOWSPEC object is included with
the FS-ID matching the one being removed, and the R bit is set to
indicate removal. In this case, it is not necessary to include any Flow
Specification TLVs.[¶](#section-8.5-2){.pilcrow}

If the R bit is set and Flow Specification TLVs are present, an
implementation [MAY]{.bcp14} ignore them. If the implementation checks
the Flow Specification TLVs against those recorded for the FS-ID and
Speaker Entity Identifier of the Flow Specification being removed and
finds a mismatch, the Flow Specification matching the FS-ID
[MUST]{.bcp14} still be removed, and the implementation [SHOULD]{.bcp14}
record a local exception or log.[¶](#section-8.5-3){.pilcrow}

### [8.6.](#section-8.6){.section-number .selfRef} [VPN Identifiers](#name-vpn-identifiers){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-vpn-identifiers}

VPN instances are identified in BGP using RDs
\[[RFC4364](#RFC4364){.xref}\]. These values are not normally considered
to have any meaning outside of the network, and they are not encoded in
data packets belonging to the VPNs. However, RDs provide a useful way of
identifying VPN instances and are often manually or automatically
assigned to VPNs as they are provisioned.[¶](#section-8.6-1){.pilcrow}

Thus, the RD provides a useful way to indicate that traffic for a
particular VPN should be placed on a given tunnel. The tunnel head end
will need to interpret this Flow Specification not as a filter on the
fields of data packets but rather using the other mechanisms that it
already uses to identify VPN traffic. These mechanisms could be based on
the incoming port (for port-based VPNs) or may leverage knowledge of the
VPN Routing and Forwarding (VRF) that is in use for the
traffic.[¶](#section-8.6-2){.pilcrow}

### [8.7.](#section-8.7){.section-number .selfRef} [Priorities and Overlapping Flow Specifications](#name-priorities-and-overlapping-){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-priorities-and-overlapping-}

Flow Specifications can overlap. For example, two different Flow
Specifications may be identical except for the length of the prefix in
the destination address. In these cases, the PCC must determine how to
prioritize the Flow Specifications so as to know which path to assign
packets that match both Flow Specifications. That is, the PCC must
assign a precedence to the Flow Specifications so that it checks each
incoming packet for a match in a predictable
order.[¶](#section-8.7-1){.pilcrow}

The processing of BGP Flow Specifications is described in
\[[RFC8955](#RFC8955){.xref}\]. Section
[5.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8955#section-5.1){.relref} of
that document explains the order of traffic filtering rules to be
executed by an implementation of that
specification.[¶](#section-8.7-2){.pilcrow}

PCCs [MUST]{.bcp14} apply the same ordering rules as defined in
\[[RFC8955](#RFC8955){.xref}\].[¶](#section-8.7-3){.pilcrow}

Furthermore, it is possible that Flow Specifications will be distributed
by BGP as well as by PCEP as described in this document. In such cases,
implementations supporting both approaches [MUST]{.bcp14} apply the
prioritization and ordering rules as set out in
\[[RFC8955](#RFC8955){.xref}\] regardless of which protocol distributed
the Flow Specifications. However, implementations [MAY]{.bcp14} provide
a configuration control to allow one protocol to take precedence over
the other; this may be particularly useful if the Flow Specifications
make identical matches on traffic but have different actions. It is
[RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14} that a message be logged for the operator to
understand the behavior when two Flow Specifications distributed by
different protocols overlap, especially when one acts to replace
another.[¶](#section-8.7-4){.pilcrow}

[Section 12.1](#mg-mxfspec){.xref} of this document covers manageability
considerations relevant to the prioritized ordering of Flow
Specifications.[¶](#section-8.7-5){.pilcrow}

An implementation that receives a PCEP message carrying a Flow
Specification that it cannot resolve against other Flow Specifications
already installed (for example, because the new Flow Specification has
irresolvable conflicts with other Flow Specifications that are already
installed) [MUST]{.bcp14} respond with a PCErr message with Error-Type
30 (FlowSpec Error) and Error-value 3 (Unresolvable Conflict) and [MUST

## [11.](#section-11){.section-number .selfRef} [Security Considerations](#name-security-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-security-considerations}

We may assume that a system that utilizes a remote PCE is subject to a
number of vulnerabilities that could allow spurious LSPs or SR paths to
be established or that could result in existing paths being modified or
torn down. Such systems, therefore, apply security considerations as
described in \[[RFC5440](#RFC5440){.xref}\], [Section
2.5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6952#section-2.5){.relref} of
\[[RFC6952](#RFC6952){.xref}\], \[[RFC8253](#RFC8253){.xref}\], and
\[[RFC8955](#RFC8955){.xref}\].[¶](#section-11-1){.pilcrow}

The description of Flow Specifications associated with paths set up or
controlled by a PCE adds a further detail that could be attacked without
tearing down LSPs or SR paths but causes traffic to be misrouted within
the network. Therefore, the use of the security mechanisms for PCEP
referenced above is important.[¶](#section-11-2){.pilcrow}

Visibility into the information carried in PCEP does not have direct
privacy concerns for end users\' data; however, knowledge of how data is
routed in a network may make that data more vulnerable. Of course, the
ability to interfere with the way data is routed also makes the data
more vulnerable. Furthermore, knowledge of the connected endpoints (such
as multicast receivers or VPN sites) is usually considered private
customer information. Therefore, implementations or deployments
concerned with protecting privacy [MUST]{.bcp14} apply the mechanisms
described in the documents referenced above, in particular, to secure
the PCEP session using IPsec per Sections
[10.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5440#section-10.4){.relref} to
[10.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5440#section-10.6){.relref} of
\[[RFC5440](#RFC5440){.xref}\] or TLS per
\[[RFC8253](#RFC8253){.xref}\]. Note that TCP-MD5 security as originally
suggested in \[[RFC5440](#RFC5440){.xref}\] does not provide sufficient
security or privacy guarantees and [SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} be relied
upon.[¶](#section-11-3){.pilcrow}

Experience with Flow Specifications in BGP systems indicates that they
can become complex and that the overlap of Flow Specifications installed
in different orders can lead to unexpected results. Although this is not
directly a security issue per se, the confusion and unexpected
forwarding behavior may be engineered or exploited by an attacker.
Furthermore, this complexity might give rise to a situation where the
forwarding behaviors might create gaps in the monitoring and inspection
of particular traffic or provide a path that avoids expected
mitigations. Therefore, implementers and operators [SHOULD]{.bcp14} pay
careful attention to the manageability considerations described in
[Section 12](#Manage){.xref} and familiarize themselves with the careful
explanations in
\[[RFC8955](#RFC8955){.xref}\].[¶](#section-11-4){.pilcrow}

The feature introduced by this document enables operational
manageability of networks operated in conjunction with a PCE and using
PCEP. In the case of a stateful active PCE or with PCE-initiated
services, in the absence of this feature, additional manual
configuration is needed to tell the head ends what traffic to place on
the network services (LSPs, SR paths, etc.).[¶](#section-12-1){.pilcrow}

### [12.1.](#section-12.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Management of Multiple Flow Specifications](#name-management-of-multiple-flow){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-management-of-multiple-flow}

Experience with Flow Specification in BGP suggests that there can be a
lot of complexity when two or more Flow Specifications overlap. This can
arise, for example, with addresses indicated using prefixes and could
cause confusion about what traffic should be placed on which path.
Unlike the behavior in a distributed routing system, it is not important
to the routing stability and consistency of the network that each
head-end implementation applies the same rules to disambiguate
overlapping Flow Specifications, but it is important
that:[¶](#section-12.1-1){.pilcrow}

-   [a network operator can easily find out what traffic is being placed
    on which path and why. This will facilitate analysis of the network
    and diagnosis of
    faults.[¶](#section-12.1-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-12.1-2.1}
-   [a PCE be able to correctly predict the effect of instructions it
    gives to a PCC. This will ensure that traffic is correctly placed on
    the network without causing congestion or other network
    inefficiencies and that traffic is correctly
    delivered.[¶](#section-12.1-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-12.1-2.2}

To that end, a PCC [MUST]{.bcp14} enable an operator to view the Flow
Specifications that it has installed, and these [MUST]{.bcp14} be
presented in order of precedence such that when two Flow Specifications
overlap, the one that will be serviced with higher precedence is
presented to the operator first.[¶](#section-12.1-3){.pilcrow}

Support for the function described in this document implies that a
functional element that is capable of requesting that a PCE compute and
control a path is also able to configure the specification of what
traffic should be placed on that path. Where there is a human involved
in this action, configuration of the Flow Specification must be
available through an interface (such as a graphical user interface or a
Command Line Interface). Where a distinct software component (i.e., one
not co-implemented with the PCE) is used, a protocol mechanism will be
required that could be PCEP itself or a data model, such as extensions
to the YANG model for requesting path computation
\[[TEAS-YANG-PATH](#I-D.ietf-teas-yang-path-computation){.xref}\].[¶](#section-12.2-1){.pilcrow}

Implementations [MAY]{.bcp14} be constructed with a configurable switch
to indicate whether they support the functions defined in this document.
Otherwise, such implementations [MUST]{.bcp14} indicate that they
support the function as described in [Section 4](#cap){.xref}. If an
implementation allows configurable support of this function, that
support [MAY]{.bcp14} be configurable per peer or once for the whole
implementation.[¶](#section-12.2-2){.pilcrow}

As mentioned in [Section 12.1](#mg-mxfspec){.xref}, a PCE implementation
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} provide a mechanism to configure variations in the
precedence ordering of Flow Specifications per
PCC.[¶](#section-12.2-3){.pilcrow}

The YANG model in \[[PCE-PCEP-YANG](#I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-yang){.xref}\]
can be used to model and monitor PCEP states and messages. To make that
YANG model useful for the extensions described in this document, it
would need to be augmented to cover the new protocol
elements.[¶](#section-12.3-1){.pilcrow}

Similarly, as noted in [Section 12.2](#mg-control){.xref}, the YANG
model defined in
\[[TEAS-YANG-PATH](#I-D.ietf-teas-yang-path-computation){.xref}\] could
be extended to allow the specification of Flow
Specifications.[¶](#section-12.3-2){.pilcrow}

Finally, as mentioned in [Section 12.1](#mg-mxfspec){.xref}, a PCC
implementation [SHOULD]{.bcp14} provide a mechanism to allow an operator
to read the Flow Specifications from a PCC and to understand in what
order they will be executed. This could be achieved using a new YANG
model.[¶](#section-12.3-3){.pilcrow}

In addition to the YANG model, for reading Flow Specifications described
in [Section 12.3](#mg-model){.xref}, tools may be needed to inject

criteria so that it can be monitored while traveling along the desired

The use of the features described in this document clearly have an
important impact on network traffic since they cause traffic to be
routed on specific paths in the network. However, in practice, these
changes make no direct changes to the network operation because traffic
is already placed on those paths using some pre-existing configuration
mechanism. Thus, the significant change is the reduction in mechanisms
that have to be applied rather than a change to how the traffic is
passed through the network.[¶](#section-12.7-1){.pilcrow}
