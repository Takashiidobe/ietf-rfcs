# RFC 8691 {#rfcnum}

# Basic Support for IPv6 Networks Operating Outside the Context of a Basic Service Set over IEEE Std 802.11 {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

This document provides methods and settings for using IPv6 to
communicate among nodes within range of one another over a single IEEE
802.11-OCB link. Support for these methods and settings require minimal
changes to existing stacks. This document also describes limitations
associated with using these methods. Optimizations and usage of IPv6
over more complex scenarios are not covered in this specification and
are a subject for future work.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

This document provides a baseline for using IPv6 to communicate among
nodes in range of one another over a single IEEE 802.11-OCB link
\[[IEEE-802.11-2016](#IEEE-802.11-2016){.xref}\] (a.k.a., 802.11p; see
Appendices [A](#i802.11p){.xref}, [B](#introduced-by-OCB){.xref}, and
[C](#software-changes){.xref}) with minimal changes to existing stacks.
Moreover, the document identifies the limitations of such usage.
Concretely, the document describes the layering of IPv6 networking on
top of the IEEE Std 802.11 MAC layer or an IEEE Std 802.3 MAC layer with
a frame translation underneath. The resulting stack is derived from IPv6
over Ethernet \[[RFC2464](#RFC2464){.xref}\] but operates over
802.11-OCB to provide at least P2P (point-to-point) connectivity using
IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) and link-local
addresses.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

The IPv6 network layer operates on 802.11-OCB in the same manner as
operating on the Ethernet with the following
exceptions:[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

-   [Exceptions due to the different operation of the IPv6 network layer
    on 802.11 compared to the Ethernet. The operation of IP on Ethernet
    is described in \[[RFC1042](#RFC1042){.xref}\] and
    \[[RFC2464](#RFC2464){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-3.1}
-   [Exceptions due to the OCB nature of 802.11-OCB compared to 802.11.
    This has impacts on security, privacy, subnet structure, and
    movement detection. Security and privacy recommendations are
    discussed in Sections [4.4](#slaac){.xref} and
    [5](#Security){.xref}. The subnet structure is described in [Section
    4.6](#subnet-structure){.xref}. The movement detection on OCB links
    is not described in this document. Likewise, ND extensions and IP
    Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments (IPWAVE) optimizations for
    vehicular communications are not in scope of this document. The
    expectation is that further specifications will be edited to cover
    more complex vehicular networking
    scenarios.[¶](#section-1-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-3.2}

The reader may refer to
\[[IPWAVE](#I-D.ietf-ipwave-vehicular-networking){.xref}\] for an
overview of problems related to running IPv6 over 802.11-OCB. It is out
of scope of this document to reiterate those
problems.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

The document makes uses of the following
terms:[¶](#section-2-2){.pilcrow}

IP-OBU (Internet Protocol On-Board Unit):
:   An IP-OBU denotes a computer situated in a vehicle such as a car,
    bicycle, or similar. It has at least one IP interface that runs in
    mode OCB of 802.11 and has an \"OBU\" transceiver. See the
    definition of the term \"OBU\" in [Appendix
    H](#extra-terminology){.xref}.[¶](#section-2-3.2){.pilcrow}

IP-RSU (IP Roadside Unit):
:   An IP-RSU is situated along the road. It has at least two distinct
    IP-enabled interfaces. The wireless PHY/MAC layer of at least one of
    its IP-enabled interfaces is configured to operate in 802.11-OCB
    mode. An IP-RSU communicates with the IP-OBU over an 802.11 wireless
    link operating in OCB mode. An IP-RSU is similar to an Access
    Network Router (ANR), defined in \[[RFC3753](#RFC3753){.xref}\], and
    a Wireless Termination Point (WTP), defined in
    \[[RFC5415](#RFC5415){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2-3.4){.pilcrow}

OCB (outside the context of a Basic Service Set - BSS):
:   This is a mode of operation in which a station (STA) is not a member
    of a BSS and does not utilize IEEE Std 802.11 authentication,
    association, or data confidentiality.[¶](#section-2-3.6){.pilcrow}

802.11-OCB:
:   This refers to the mode specified in IEEE Std 802.11-2016 when the
    MIB attribute dot11OCBActivited is
    \'true\'.[¶](#section-2-3.8){.pilcrow}

## [3.](#section-3){.section-number .selfRef} [Communication Scenarios Where IEEE 802.11-OCB Links Are Used](#name-communication-scenarios-whe){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-communication-scenarios-whe}

IEEE 802.11-OCB networks are used for vehicular communications as
\'Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments\'. In particular, we refer
the reader to
\[[IPWAVE](#I-D.ietf-ipwave-vehicular-networking){.xref}\], which lists
some scenarios and requirements for IP in Intelligent Transportation
Systems (ITS).[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

The link model is the following: STA \-\-- 802.11-OCB \-\-- STA. In
vehicular networks, STAs can be IP-RSUs and/or IP-OBUs. All links are
assumed to be P2P, and multiple links can be on one radio interface.
While 802.11-OCB is clearly specified and a legacy IPv6 stack can
operate on such links, the use of the operating environment (vehicular
networks) brings in new perspectives.[¶](#section-3-2){.pilcrow}

### [4.1.](#section-4.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU)](#name-maximum-transmission-unit-m){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-maximum-transmission-unit-m}

The default MTU for IP packets on 802.11-OCB is inherited from
\[[RFC2464](#RFC2464){.xref}\] and, as such, is 1500 octets. As noted in
\[[RFC8200](#RFC8200){.xref}\], every link on the Internet must have a
minimum MTU of 1280 octets and must follow the other recommendations,
especially with regard to fragmentation.[¶](#section-4.1-1){.pilcrow}

### [4.2.](#section-4.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Frame Format](#name-frame-format){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-frame-format}

IP packets [MUST]{.bcp14} be transmitted over 802.11-OCB media as QoS
data frames whose format is specified in an IEEE 802.11 spec
\[[IEEE-802.11-2016](#IEEE-802.11-2016){.xref}\].[¶](#section-4.2-1){.pilcrow}

The IPv6 packet transmitted on 802.11-OCB is immediately preceded by a
Logical Link Control (LLC) header and an 802.11 header. In the LLC
header and in accordance with EtherType Protocol Discrimination (EPD;
see [Appendix D](#epd){.xref}), the value of the Type field
[MUST]{.bcp14} be set to 0x86DD (IPv6). The mapping to the 802.11 data
service [SHOULD]{.bcp14} use a \'priority\' value of 1 (QoS with a
\'Background\' user priority), reserving higher priority values for
safety-critical and time-sensitive traffic, including the ones listed in
\[[ETSI-sec-archi](#ETSI-sec-archi){.xref}\].[¶](#section-4.2-2){.pilcrow}

To simplify the Application Programming Interface (API) between the
operating system and the 802.11-OCB media, device drivers [MAY]{.bcp14}
implement IPv6 over Ethernet as per \[[RFC2464](#RFC2464){.xref}\] and
then a frame translation from 802.3 to 802.11 in order to minimize the
code changes.[¶](#section-4.2-3){.pilcrow}

### [4.3.](#section-4.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Link-Local Addresses](#name-link-local-addresses){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-link-local-addresses}

There are several types of IPv6 addresses \[[RFC4291](#RFC4291){.xref}\]
\[[RFC4193](#RFC4193){.xref}\] that may be assigned to an 802.11-OCB
interface. Among these types of addresses, only the IPv6 link-local
addresses can be formed using an EUI-64 identifier, particularly during
transition time (the period of time before an interface starts using an
address different from the LL one).[¶](#section-4.3-1){.pilcrow}

If the IPv6 link-local address is formed using an EUI-64 identifier,
then the mechanism for forming that address is the same mechanism as
that used to form an IPv6 link-local address on Ethernet links.
Moreover, regardless of whether the interface identifier is derived from
the EUI-64 identifier, its length is 64 bits, as is the case for the
Ethernet \[[RFC2464](#RFC2464){.xref}\].[¶](#section-4.3-2){.pilcrow}

### [4.4.](#section-4.4){.section-number .selfRef} [Stateless Autoconfiguration](#name-stateless-autoconfiguration){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-stateless-autoconfiguration}

The steps a host takes in deciding how to autoconfigure its interfaces
in IPv6 are described in \[[RFC4862](#RFC4862){.xref}\]. This section
describes the formation of Interface Identifiers for \'Global\' or
\'Unique Local\' IPv6 addresses. Interface Identifiers for
\'link-local\' IPv6 addresses are discussed in [Section
4.3](#ll){.xref}.[¶](#section-4.4-1){.pilcrow}

The [RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14} method for forming stable Interface
Identifiers (IIDs) is described in \[[RFC8064](#RFC8064){.xref}\]. The
method of forming IIDs described in [Section
4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2464#section-4){.relref} of
\[[RFC2464](#RFC2464){.xref}\] [MAY]{.bcp14} be used during transition
time, particularly for IPv6 link-local addresses. Regardless of the
method used to form the IID, its length is 64 bits, similarly to IPv6
over Ethernet
\[[RFC2464](#RFC2464){.xref}\].[¶](#section-4.4-2){.pilcrow}

The bits in the IID have no specific meaning, and the identifier should
be treated as an opaque value. The bits \'Universal\' and \'Group\' in
the identifier of an 802.11-OCB interface, which is an IEEE link-layer

in \[[RFC7136](#RFC7136){.xref}\].[¶](#section-4.4-3){.pilcrow}

Semantically opaque IIDs, instead of meaningful IIDs derived from a
valid and meaningful MAC address (\[[RFC2464](#RFC2464){.xref}\],
[Section 4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2464#section-4){.relref}),
help avoid certain privacy risks (see the risks mentioned in [Section
5.1.1](#privacy-opaque-iid){.xref}). If semantically opaque IIDs are
needed, they may be generated using the method for generating
semantically opaque IIDs with IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration
given in \[[RFC7217](#RFC7217){.xref}\]. Typically, an opaque IID is
formed starting from identifiers different from the MAC addresses and
from cryptographically strong material. Thus, privacy-sensitive
information is absent from Interface IDs because it is impossible to
calculate back the initial value from which the Interface ID was first
generated.[¶](#section-4.4-4){.pilcrow}

Some applications that use IPv6 packets on 802.11-OCB links (among other
link types) may benefit from IPv6 addresses whose IIDs don\'t change too
often. It is [RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14} to use the mechanisms described in
\[[RFC7217](#RFC7217){.xref}\] to permit the use of stable IIDs that do
not change within one subnet prefix. A possible source for the Net_Iface
parameter is a virtual interface name or logical interface name that is
decided by a local administrator.[¶](#section-4.4-5){.pilcrow}

### [4.6.](#section-4.6){.section-number .selfRef} [Subnet Structure](#name-subnet-structure){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-subnet-structure}

When vehicles are in close range, a subnet may be formed over 802.11-OCB
interfaces (not by their in-vehicle interfaces). A Prefix List
conceptual data structure (\[[RFC4861](#RFC4861){.xref}\], [Section
5.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4861#section-5.1){.relref}) is
maintained for each 802.11-OCB interface.[¶](#section-4.6-1){.pilcrow}

The IPv6 Neighbor Discovery protocol (ND) requires reflexive properties
(bidirectional connectivity), which is generally, though not always, the
case for P2P OCB links. IPv6 ND also requires transitive properties for
DAD and AR, so an IPv6 subnet can be mapped on an OCB network only if
all nodes in the network share a single physical broadcast domain. The
extension to IPv6 ND operating on a subnet that covers multiple OCB
links and does not fully overlap (i.e., non-broadcast multi-access
(NBMA)) is not in scope of this document. Finally, IPv6 ND requires
permanent connectivity of all nodes in the subnet to defend their
addresses \-- in other words, very stable network
conditions.[¶](#section-4.6-2){.pilcrow}

The structure of this subnet is ephemeral in that it is strongly
influenced by the mobility of vehicles: the hidden terminal effects
appear, and the 802.11 networks in OCB mode may be considered ad hoc
networks with an addressing model, as described in
\[[RFC5889](#RFC5889){.xref}\]. On the other hand, the structure of the
internal subnets in each vehicle is relatively
stable.[¶](#section-4.6-3){.pilcrow}

As recommended in \[[RFC5889](#RFC5889){.xref}\], when the timing
requirements are very strict (e.g., fast-drive-through IP-RSU coverage),
no on-link subnet prefix should be configured on an 802.11-OCB
interface. In such cases, the exclusive use of IPv6 link-local addresses
is [RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14}.[¶](#section-4.6-4){.pilcrow}

Additionally, even if the timing requirements are not very strict (e.g.,
the moving subnet formed by two following vehicles is stable, a fixed
IP-RSU is absent), the subnet is disconnected from the Internet (i.e., a
default route is absent), and the addressing peers are equally qualified
(that is, it is impossible to determine whether some vehicle owns and
distributes addresses to others), the use of link-local addresses is
[RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14}.[¶](#section-4.6-5){.pilcrow}

The baseline ND protocol \[[RFC4861](#RFC4861){.xref}\] [MUST]{.bcp14}
be supported over 802.11-OCB links. Transmitting ND packets may prove to
have some performance issues, as mentioned in [Section
4.5.2](#address-mapping-multicast){.xref} and [Appendix
I](#nd-wireless){.xref}. These issues may be exacerbated in OCB mode.
Solutions for these problems should consider the OCB mode of operation.
Future solutions to OCB should consider solutions for avoiding
broadcast. The best of current knowledge indicates the kinds of issues
that may arise with ND in OCB mode; they are described in [Appendix
I](#nd-wireless){.xref}.[¶](#section-4.6-6){.pilcrow}

Protocols like Mobile IPv6 \[[RFC6275](#RFC6275){.xref}\]
\[[RFC3963](#RFC3963){.xref}\] and DNAv6 \[[RFC6059](#RFC6059){.xref}\],
which depend on timely movement detection, might need additional tuning
work to handle the lack of link-layer notifications during handover.
This topic is left for further study.[¶](#section-4.6-7){.pilcrow}

## [5.](#section-5){.section-number .selfRef} [Security Considerations](#name-security-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-security-considerations}

Any security mechanism at the IP layer or above that may be implemented
for the general case of IPv6 may also be implemented for IPv6 operating
over 802.11-OCB.[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

The OCB operation does not use existing 802.11 link-layer security
mechanisms. There is no encryption applied below the network layer
running on 802.11-OCB. At the application layer, the IEEE 1609.2
document \[[IEEE-1609.2](#IEEE-1609.2){.xref}\] provides security
services for certain applications to use; application-layer mechanisms
are out of scope of this document. On the other hand, a security
mechanism provided at the networking layer, such as IPsec
\[[RFC4301](#RFC4301){.xref}\], may provide data security protection to
a wider range of applications.[¶](#section-5-2){.pilcrow}

802.11-OCB does not provide any cryptographic protection because it
operates outside the context of a BSS (no Association Request/Response
or Challenge messages). Therefore, an attacker can sniff or inject
traffic while within range of a vehicle or IP-RSU (by setting an
interface card\'s frequency to the proper range). Also, an attacker may
not adhere to the legal limits for radio power and can use a very
sensitive directional antenna; if attackers wish to attack a given
exchange, they do not necessarily need to be in close physical
proximity. Hence, such a link is less protected than commonly used links
(a wired link or the aforementioned 802.11 links with link-layer
security).[¶](#section-5-3){.pilcrow}

Therefore, any node can join a subnet and directly communicate with any
nodes on the subset, including potentially impersonating another node.
This design allows for a number of threats outlined in [Section
3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6959#section-3){.relref} of
\[[RFC6959](#RFC6959){.xref}\]. While not widely deployed, SEND
\[[RFC3971](#RFC3971){.xref}\] \[[RFC3972](#RFC3972){.xref}\] is a
solution that can address spoof-based attack
vectors.[¶](#section-5-4){.pilcrow}

::: {#Privacy}
::: {#section-5.1 .section}
### [5.1.](#section-5.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Privacy Considerations](#name-privacy-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-privacy-considerations}

As with all Ethernet and 802.11 interface identifiers
\[[RFC7721](#RFC7721){.xref}\], the identifier of an 802.11-OCB
interface may involve privacy, MAC address spoofing, and IP hijacking
risks. A vehicle embarking an IP-OBU whose egress interface is
802.11-OCB may expose itself to eavesdropping and subsequent correlation
of data. This may reveal data considered private by the vehicle owner;
there is a risk of being tracked. In outdoor public environments, where
vehicles typically circulate, the privacy risks are greater than in
indoor settings. It is highly likely that attacker sniffers are deployed
along routes that listen for IEEE frames, including IP packets, of
vehicles passing by. For this reason, in 802.11-OCB deployments, there
is a strong necessity to use protection tools such as dynamically
changing MAC addresses ([Section 5.2](#mac-change){.xref}), semantically
opaque Interface Identifiers, and stable Interface Identifiers ([Section
4.4](#slaac){.xref}). An example of a change policy is to change the MAC
address of the OCB interface each time the system boots up. This may
help mitigate privacy risks to a certain level. Furthermore, for privacy
concerns, \[[RFC8065](#RFC8065){.xref}\] recommends using an
address-generation scheme rather than generating addresses from a fixed
link-layer address. However, there are some specificities related to
vehicles. Since roaming is an important characteristic of moving
vehicles, the use of the same Link-Local Address over time can indicate
the presence of the same vehicle in different places and thus lead to
location tracking. Hence, a vehicle should get hints about a change of
environment (e.g., engine running, GPS, etc.) and renew the IID in its
LLAs.[¶](#section-5.1-1){.pilcrow}

The privacy risks of using MAC addresses displayed in Interface
Identifiers are important. IPv6 packets can be captured easily on the
Internet and on-link on public roads. For this reason, an attacker may
realize many attacks on privacy. One such attack on 802.11-OCB is to
capture, store, and correlate company ID information present in the MAC
addresses of a large number of cars (e.g., listening for Router
Advertisements or other IPv6 application data packets, and recording the
value of the source address in these packets). Further correlation of
this information with other data captured by other means or other visual
information (e.g., car color) may constitute privacy
risks.[¶](#section-5.1.1-1){.pilcrow}

### [5.2.](#section-5.2){.section-number .selfRef} [MAC Address and Interface ID Generation](#name-mac-address-and-interface-i){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-mac-address-and-interface-i}

In 802.11-OCB networks, the MAC addresses may change during well-defined
renumbering events. At the moment the MAC address is changed on an
802.11-OCB interface, all the Interface Identifiers of IPv6 addresses
assigned to that interface [MUST]{.bcp14}
change.[¶](#section-5.2-1){.pilcrow}

Implementations should use a policy dictating when the MAC address is
changed on the 802.11-OCB interface. For more information on the
motivation of this policy, please refer to the privacy discussion in
[Appendix B](#introduced-by-OCB){.xref}.[¶](#section-5.2-2){.pilcrow}

A \'randomized\' MAC address has the following
characteristics:[¶](#section-5.2-3){.pilcrow}

-   [The \"Local/Global\" bit is set to \"locally
    administered\".[¶](#section-5.2-4.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.2-4.1}
-   [The \"Unicast/Multicast\" bit is set to
    \"Unicast\".[¶](#section-5.2-4.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.2-4.2}
-   [The 46 remaining bits are set to a random value using a random
    number generator that meets the requirements of
    \[[RFC4086](#RFC4086){.xref}\].[¶](#section-5.2-4.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.2-4.3}

To meet the randomization requirements for the 46 remaining bits, a hash
function may be used. For example, the hash function defined in
\[[SHA256](#SHA256){.xref}\] may be used with the input of a 256-bit
local secret, the \'nominal\' MAC address of the interface, and a
representation of the date and time of the renumbering
event.[¶](#section-5.2-5){.pilcrow}

A randomized Interface ID has the same characteristics of a randomized
MAC address except for the length in bits.[¶](#section-5.2-6){.pilcrow}

The term \"802.11p\" is an earlier definition. The behavior of
\"802.11p\" networks is rolled in
\[[IEEE-802.11-2016](#IEEE-802.11-2016){.xref}\]. In that document, the
term \"802.11p\" disappears. Instead, each 802.11p feature is
conditioned by the IEEE Management Information Base (MIB) attribute
\"OCBActivated\" \[[IEEE-802.11-2016](#IEEE-802.11-2016){.xref}\].
Whenever OCBActivated is set to \"true\", the IEEE Std 802.11-OCB state
is activated. For example, an 802.11 STAtion operating outside the
context of a BSS has the OCBActivated flag set. Such a station, when it
has the flag set, uses a BSS identifier equal to
ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff.[¶](#section-appendix.a-1){.pilcrow}

In IEEE 802.11-OCB mode, all nodes in the wireless range can directly
communicate with each other without involving authentication or
association procedures. In OCB mode, the manner in which channels are
selected and used is simplified compared to when in BSS mode. Contrary
to BSS mode, at the link layer, it is necessary to statically set the
same channel number (or frequency) on two stations that need to
communicate with each other (in BSS mode, this channel set operation is
performed automatically during \'scanning\'). The manner in which
stations set their channel number in OCB mode is not specified in this
document. Stations STA1 and STA2 can exchange IP packets only if they
are set to the same channel. At the IP layer, they then discover each
other by using the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery protocol. The allocation of a
particular channel for a particular use is defined statically in
standards authored by ETSI in Europe, the FCC in the United States of
America, and similar organizations in South Korea, Japan, and other
parts of the world.[¶](#section-appendix.b-1){.pilcrow}

Briefly, the IEEE 802.11-OCB mode has the following
properties:[¶](#section-appendix.b-2){.pilcrow}

All the nodes in the radio communication range (IP-OBU and IP-RSU)
receive all the messages transmitted (IP-OBU and IP-RSU) within the
radio communication range. The MAC CDMA function resolves any eventual
conflict(s).[¶](#section-appendix.b-4){.pilcrow}

:::

The 802.11-OCB interface was specified in
\[[IEEE-802.11p-2010](#IEEE-802.11p-2010){.xref}\], Amendment 6:
Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments, as an amendment to
\[[IEEE-802.11-2007](#IEEE-802.11-2007){.xref}\]. Since then, this
amendment has been integrated into
\[[IEEE-802.11-2012](#IEEE-802.11-2012){.xref}\] and
\[[IEEE-802.11-2016](#IEEE-802.11-2016){.xref}\].[¶](#section-appendix.b-7){.pilcrow}

In \[[IEEE-802.11p-2010](#IEEE-802.11p-2010){.xref}\], anything
qualified specifically as \"OCBActivated\" or \"outside the context of a
basic service\" that is set to be \"true\" actually refers to OCB
aspects introduced to 802.11.[¶](#section-appendix.b-8){.pilcrow}

In order to delineate the aspects introduced by 802.11-OCB to 802.11, we
refer to the earlier \[[IEEE-802.11p-2010](#IEEE-802.11p-2010){.xref}\].
The amendment is concerned with vehicular communications, where the
wireless link is similar to that of Wireless LAN (using a PHY layer
specified by 802.11a/b/g/n) but needs to cope with the high mobility
factor inherent in scenarios of communications between moving vehicles
and between vehicles and fixed infrastructure deployed along roads.
While \'p\' is a letter identifying the Amendment, just like \'a\',
\'b\', \'g\', and \'n\' are, \'p\' is concerned more with MAC
modifications and is slightly concerned with PHY modifications; the
others are mainly about PHY modifications. It is possible in practice to
combine a \'p\' MAC with an \'a\' PHY by operating outside the context
of a BSS with Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) at 5.4
GHz and 5.9 GHz.[¶](#section-appendix.b-9){.pilcrow}

The 802.11-OCB links are specified to be as compatible as possible with
the behavior of 802.11a/b/g/n and future generation IEEE WLAN links.
From the IP perspective, an 802.11-OCB MAC layer offers practically the
same interface to IP as 802.11a/b/g/n and 802.3. A packet sent by an
IP-OBU may be received by one or multiple IP-RSUs. The link-layer
resolution is performed by using the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery
protocol.[¶](#section-appendix.b-10){.pilcrow}

To support this similarity statement (IPv6 is layered on top of LLC on
top of 802.11-OCB in the same way that IPv6 is layered on top of LLC on
top of 802.11a/b/g/n (for WLAN) or on top of LLC on top of 802.3 (for
Ethernet)), it is useful to analyze the differences between the
802.11-OCB and 802.11 specifications. During this analysis, we note that
whereas 802.11-OCB lists relatively complex and numerous changes to the
MAC layer (and very few to the PHY layer), there are only a few
characteristics that may be important for an implementation transmitting
IPv6 packets on 802.11-OCB links.[¶](#section-appendix.b-11){.pilcrow}

The most important 802.11-OCB aspect that influences the IPv6
functioning is the OCB characteristic; an additional, less direct
influence is the maximum bandwidth afforded by the PHY
modulation/demodulation methods and channel access specified by
802.11-OCB. The maximum bandwidth theoretically possible in 802.11-OCB
is 54 Mbit/s (when using, for example, the following parameters: a 20
MHz channel; modulation of 64-QAM; a coding rate R of 3/4). With regard
to IP over 802.11-OCB, in practice, a commonly observed figure is 12
Mbit/s; this bandwidth allows the operation of a wide range of protocols
relying on IPv6.[¶](#section-appendix.b-12){.pilcrow}

-   [Operation outside the context of a BSS (OCB): The 802.11-OCB links
    (previously 802.11p) are operated without a BSS. This means that
    IEEE 802.11 beacon, Association Request/Response, Authentication
    Request/Response, and similar frames are not used. The used
    identifier of BSS (BSSID) always has a hexadecimal value of
    0xffffffffffff (48 \'1\' bits, represented as MAC address
    ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff; otherwise, the \'wildcard\' BSSID), as opposed to
    an arbitrary BSSID value set by an administrator (e.g.,
    \'My-Home-AccessPoint\'). The OCB operation \-- namely, the lack of
    beacon-based scanning and lack of authentication \-- should be taken
    into account when the Mobile IPv6 protocol
    \[[RFC6275](#RFC6275){.xref}\] and the protocols for IP layer
    security \[[RFC4301](#RFC4301){.xref}\] are used. The way these
    protocols adapt to OCB is not described in this
    document.[¶](#section-appendix.b-13.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-appendix.b-13.1}
-   [Timing Advertisement: This is a new message defined in 802.11-OCB
    that does not exist in 802.11a/b/g/n. This message is used by
    stations to inform other stations about the value of time. It is
    similar to the time delivered by a Global Navigation Satellite
    System (GNSS) (e.g., Galileo, GPS, etc.) or by a cellular system.
    This message is optional for
    implementation.[¶](#section-appendix.b-13.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-appendix.b-13.2}
-   [Frequency range: This is a characteristic of the PHY layer; it has
    almost no impact on the interface between MAC and IP. However, it is
    worth considering that the frequency range is regulated by a
    regional authority (ARCEP, ECC/CEPT based on ENs from ETSI, FCC,
    etc.); as part of the regulation process, specific applications are
    associated with specific frequency ranges. In the case of
    802.11-OCB, the regulator associates a set of frequency ranges or
    slots within a band to the use of applications of vehicular
    communications in a band known as \"5.9 GHz\". The 5.9 GHz band is
    different from the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands used by Wireless LAN.
    However, as with Wireless LAN, the operation of 802.11-OCB in 5.9
    GHz bands does not require a license in the EU (in the US, the 5.9
    GHz is a licensed band of spectrum; for the fixed infrastructure,
    explicit FCC authorization is required; for an on-board device, a
    \'licensed-by-rule\' concept applies, where rule certification
    conformity is required). Technical conditions are different from
    those of the \"2.4 GHz\" or \"5 GHz\" bands. The allowed power
    levels and, implicitly, the maximum allowed distance between
    vehicles is 33 dBm for 802.11-OCB (in Europe) compared to 20 dBm for
    Wireless LAN 802.11a/b/g/n; this leads to a maximum distance of
    approximately 1 km compared to approximately 50 m. Additionally,
    specific conditions related to congestion avoidance, jamming
    avoidance, and radar detection are imposed on the use of DSRC (in
    the US) and on the use of frequencies for Intelligent Transportation
    Systems (in the EU) compared to Wireless LAN
    (802.11a/b/g/n).[¶](#section-appendix.b-13.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-appendix.b-13.3}
-   [\'Half-rate\' encoding: As the frequency range, this parameter is
    related to PHY and thus does not have much impact on the interface
    between the IP layer and the MAC
    layer.[¶](#section-appendix.b-13.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-appendix.b-13.4}
-   [In vehicular communications using 802.11-OCB links, there are
    strong privacy requirements with respect to addressing. While the
    802.11-OCB standard does not specify anything in particular with
    respect to MAC addresses, in these settings, there is a strong need
    for a dynamic change of these addresses (as opposed to the
    non-vehicular settings \-- real wall protection \-- where fixed MAC
    addresses do not currently pose privacy risks). This is further
    described in [Section 5](#Security){.xref}. A relevant function is

The networks defined by 802.11-OCB are in many ways similar to other
networks of the 802.11 family. In theory, the transportation of IPv6
over 802.11-OCB could be very similar to the operation of IPv6 over
other networks of the 802.11 family. However, the high mobility, strong
link asymmetry, and very short connection makes the 802.11-OCB link
significantly different from other 802.11 networks. Also, automotive
applications have specific requirements for reliability, security, and
privacy, which further add to the particularity of the 802.11-OCB
link.[¶](#section-appendix.e-1){.pilcrow}

This section describes an example of an IPv6 packet captured over an
IEEE 802.11-OCB link.[¶](#section-appendix.g-1){.pilcrow}

By way of example, we show that there is no modification in the headers
when transmitted over 802.11-OCB networks \-- they are transmitted like
any other 802.11 and Ethernet
packets.[¶](#section-appendix.g-2){.pilcrow}

We describe an experiment for capturing an IPv6 packet on an 802.11-OCB
link. In the topology depicted in [Figure 3](#topo){.xref}, the packet
is an IPv6 Router Advertisement. This packet is emitted by a router on
its 802.11-OCB interface. The packet is captured on the host using a
network protocol analyzer (e.g., Wireshark). The capture is performed in
two different modes: direct mode and monitor mode. The topology used
during the capture is depicted
below.[¶](#section-appendix.g-3){.pilcrow}

The packet is captured on the host. The host is an IP-OBU containing an
802.11 interface in Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) Express
format (an Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) product). The
kernel runs the ath5k software driver with modifications for OCB mode.
The capture tool is Wireshark. The file format for saving and analyzing
is .pcap. The packet is generated by the router, which is an IP-RSU (an
ITRI product).[¶](#section-appendix.g-4){.pilcrow}

During several capture operations running from a few moments to several
hours, no messages relevant to the BSSID contexts were captured
(Association Request/Response, Authentication Req/Resp, or beacon). This
shows that the operation of 802.11-OCB is outside the context of a
BSSID.[¶](#section-appendix.g-6){.pilcrow}

Overall, the captured message is identical to a capture of an IPv6
packet emitted on an 802.11b interface. The contents are exactly the
same.[¶](#section-appendix.g-7){.pilcrow}

The IPv6 RA packet captured in monitor mode is illustrated below. The
Radiotap header provides more flexibility for reporting the
characteristics of frames. The Radiotap header is prepended by this
particular stack and operating system on the host machine to the RA
packet received from the network (the Radiotap header is not present on
the air). The implementation-dependent Radiotap header is useful for
piggybacking PHY information from the chip\'s registers as data in a
packet that is understandable by userland applications using socket
interfaces (the PHY interface can be, for example, power levels, data
rate, or the ratio of signal to noise).[¶](#section-g.1-1){.pilcrow}

The packet present on the air is formed by the IEEE 802.11 Data header,
Logical Link Control header, IPv6 Base header, and ICMPv6
header.[¶](#section-g.1-2){.pilcrow}

The value of the Transmitter Address in the IEEE 802.11 Data header is
set to a 48-bit value. The value of the destination address is
33:33:00:00:00:1 (all-nodes multicast address). The value of the BSS ID
field is ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff, which is recognized by the network protocol
analyzer as being \"broadcast\". The Fragment number and Sequence number
fields together are set to 0x90C6.[¶](#section-g.1-9){.pilcrow}

The value of the Organization Code field in the Logical Link Control
header is set to 0x0, recognized as \"Encapsulated Ethernet\". The value
of the Type field is 0x86DD (hexadecimal 86DD; otherwise, #86DD),
recognized as \"IPv6\".[¶](#section-g.1-10){.pilcrow}

A Router Advertisement is periodically sent by the router to multicast
group address ff02::1. It is ICMP packet type 134. The IPv6 Neighbor
Discovery\'s Router Advertisement message contains an 8-bit field
reserved for single-bit flags, as described in
\[[RFC4861](#RFC4861){.xref}\].[¶](#section-g.1-11){.pilcrow}

The IPv6 header contains the link-local address of the router (source)
configured via the EUI-64 algorithm, and the destination address is set
to ff02::1.[¶](#section-g.1-12){.pilcrow}

The Ethernet Type field in the Logical Link Control header is set to
0x86dd, which indicates that the frame transports an IPv6 packet. In the
IEEE 802.11 data, the destination address is 33:33:00:00:00:01, which is
the corresponding multicast MAC address. The BSS ID is a broadcast
address of ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff. Due to the short link duration between
vehicles and the roadside infrastructure, there is no need in IEEE
802.11-OCB to wait for the completion of association and authentication
procedures before exchanging data. IEEE 802.11-OCB enabled nodes use the

One notices that the Radiotap header, the IEEE 802.11 Data header, and
the Logical Link Control headers are not present. On the other hand, a
new header named the Ethernet II header is
present.[¶](#section-g.2-5){.pilcrow}

The Destination and Source addresses in the Ethernet II header contain
the same values as the Receiver Address and Transmitter Address fields
present in the IEEE 802.11 Data header in the monitor mode
capture.[¶](#section-g.2-6){.pilcrow}

The value of the Type field in the Ethernet II header is 0x86DD
(recognized as \"IPv6\"); this value is the same as the value of the
Type field in the Logical Link Control header in the monitor mode
capture.[¶](#section-g.2-7){.pilcrow}

The knowledgeable experimenter will no doubt notice the similarity of
this Ethernet II header with a capture in normal mode on a pure Ethernet
cable interface.[¶](#section-g.2-8){.pilcrow}

A frame translation is inserted on top of a pure IEEE 802.11 MAC layer
in order to adapt packets before delivering the payload data to the
applications. It adapts 802.11 LLC/MAC headers to Ethernet II headers.
Specifically, this adaptation consists of the elimination of the
Radiotap, 802.11, and LLC headers and the insertion of the Ethernet II
header. In this way, IPv6 runs straight over LLC over the 802.11-OCB MAC
layer; this is further confirmed by the use of the unique Type
0x86DD.[¶](#section-g.2-9){.pilcrow}

The following terms are defined outside the IETF. They are used to
define the main terms in the terminology section ([Section
2](#terminology){.xref}).[¶](#section-appendix.h-1){.pilcrow}

DSRC (Dedicated Short Range Communication):
:   The US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Dedicated Short Range
    Communication (DSRC) is defined in the Code of Federal Regulations
    (CFR) 47, Parts 90 \[[CFR-90](#CFR-90){.xref}\] and 95
    \[[CFR-95](#CFR-95){.xref}\]. This Code is referenced in the
    definitions below. At the time of the writing of this document, the
    last update of this Code was dated December 6,
    2019.[¶](#section-appendix.h-2.2){.pilcrow}

DSRCS (Dedicated Short-Range Communications Services):
:   Radio techniques are used to transfer data over short distances
    between roadside and mobile units, between mobile units, and between
    portable and mobile units to perform operations related to the
    improvement of traffic flow, traffic safety, and other intelligent
    transportation service applications in a variety of environments.
    DSRCS systems may also transmit status and instructional messages
    related to the units involved.
    \[[CFR-90.7](#CFR-90.7){.xref}\][¶](#section-appendix.h-2.4){.pilcrow}

OBU (On-Board Unit):
:   An On-Board Unit is a DSRCS transceiver that is normally mounted in
    or on a vehicle or may be a portable unit in some instances. An OBU
    can be operational while a vehicle or person is either mobile or
    stationary. The OBUs receive and contend for time to transmit on one
    or more radio frequency (RF) channels. Except where specifically
    excluded, OBU operation is permitted wherever vehicle operation or
    human passage is permitted. The OBUs mounted in vehicles are
    licensed by rule under part 95 of \[[CFR-95](#CFR-95){.xref}\] and
    communicate with Roadside Units (RSUs) and other OBUs. Portable OBUs
    are also licensed by rule under part 95 of
    \[[CFR-95](#CFR-95){.xref}\]. OBU operations in the Unlicensed
    National Information Infrastructure (U-NII) Bands follow the rules
    in those bands.
    \[[CFR-90.7](#CFR-90.7){.xref}\][¶](#section-appendix.h-2.6){.pilcrow}

RSU (Roadside Unit):
:   A Roadside Unit is a DSRC transceiver that is mounted along a road
    or pedestrian passageway. An RSU may also be mounted on a vehicle or
    may be hand carried, but it may only operate when the vehicle or
    hand-carried unit is stationary. Perhaps Furthermore, an RSU is
    restricted to the location where it is licensed to operate. However,
    portable or handheld RSUs are permitted to operate where they do not
    interfere with a site-licensed operation. An RSU broadcasts data to
    OBUs or exchanges data with OBUs in its communications zone. An RSU
    also provides channel assignments and operating instructions to OBUs
    in its communications zone when required.

## [Appendix I.](#section-appendix.i){.section-number .selfRef} [Neighbor Discovery (ND) Potential Issues in Wireless Links](#name-neighbor-discovery-nd-poten){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-neighbor-discovery-nd-poten}

IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (IPv6 ND) \[[RFC4861](#RFC4861){.xref}\]
\[[RFC4862](#RFC4862){.xref}\] was designed for point-to-point and
transit links, such as Ethernet, with the expectation of cheap and
reliable support for multicast from the lower layer. [Section
3.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4861#section-3.2){.relref} of
\[[RFC4861](#RFC4861){.xref}\] indicates that the operation on shared
media and on NBMA networks require additional support, e.g., for AR and
DAD, which depend on multicast. An infrastructureless radio network such
as OCB shares properties with both shared media and NBMA networks and
then adds its own complexity, e.g., from movement and interference that
allow only transient and non-transitive reachability between any set of
peers.[¶](#section-appendix.i-1){.pilcrow}

The uniqueness of an address within a scoped domain is a key pillar of
IPv6 and is the basis for unicast IP communication.
\[[RFC4861](#RFC4861){.xref}\] details the DAD method to prevent an
address from being duplicated. For a link-local address, the scope is
the link, whereas for a globally reachable address, the scope is much
larger. The underlying assumption for DAD to operate correctly is that
the node that owns an IPv6 address can reach any other node within the
scope at the time it claims its address, which is done by sending a
Neighbor Solicitation (NS) multicast message, and can hear any future
claim for that address by another party within the scope for the
duration of the address ownership.[¶](#section-appendix.i-2){.pilcrow}

In the case of OCB, there is a potentially a need to define a scope that
is compatible with DAD. The scope cannot be the set of nodes that a
transmitter can reach at a particular time because that set varies all
the time and does not meet the DAD requirements for a link-local address
that can be used anytime and anywhere. The generic expectation of a
reliable multicast is not ensured, and the operation of DAD and AR as
specified by \[[RFC4861](#RFC4861){.xref}\] cannot be guaranteed.
Moreover, multicast transmissions that rely on broadcast are not only
unreliable but are also often detrimental to unicast traffic (see
\[[IEEE802-MCAST](#I-D.ietf-mboned-ieee802-mcast-problems){.xref}\]).[¶](#section-appendix.i-3){.pilcrow}

Early experience indicates that it should be possible to exchange IPv6
packets over OCB while relying on IPv6 ND alone for DAD and AR (Address
Resolution) in good conditions. In the absence of a correct DAD
operation, a node that relies only on IPv6 ND for AR and DAD over OCB
should ensure that the addresses that it uses are unique by means other
than DAD. It must be noted that deriving an IPv6 address from a globally
unique MAC address has this property but may yield privacy
issues.[¶](#section-appendix.i-4){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC8505](#RFC8505){.xref}\] provides a more recent approach to IPv6
ND, in particular DAD. \[[RFC8505](#RFC8505){.xref}\] is designed to fit
wireless and otherwise constrained networks whereby multicast and/or
continuous access to the medium may not be guaranteed.
\[[RFC8505](#RFC8505){.xref}\], [Section
5.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8505#section-5.6){.relref}
(\"Link-Local Addresses and Registration\") indicates that the scope of
uniqueness for a link-local address is restricted to a pair of nodes
that uses it to communicate and provides a method to assert the
uniqueness and resolve the link-layer address using a unicast
exchange.[¶](#section-appendix.i-5){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC8505](#RFC8505){.xref}\] also enables a router (acting as a 6LR)
to own a prefix and act as a registrar (acting as a 6LBR) for addresses
within the associated subnet. A peer host (acting as a 6LN) registers an
address derived from that prefix and can use it for the lifetime of the
registration. The prefix is advertised as not on-link, which means that
the 6LN uses the 6LR to relay its packets within the subnet, and
participation to the subnet is constrained to the time of reachability
to the 6LR. Note that an RSU that provides internet connectivity
[MAY]{.bcp14} announce a default router preference
\[[RFC4191](#RFC4191){.xref}\], whereas a car that does not provide that
connectivity [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} do so. This operation presents
similarities to that of an access point, but at Layer 3. This is why
\[[RFC8505](#RFC8505){.xref}\] is well suited for wireless in
general.[¶](#section-appendix.i-6){.pilcrow}

Support of \[[RFC8505](#RFC8505){.xref}\] may be implemented on OCB. OCB
nodes that support \[[RFC8505](#RFC8505){.xref}\] [SHOULD]{.bcp14}
support the 6LN operation in order to act as a host and may support the
6LR and 6LBR operations in order to act as a router and in particular to
own a prefix that can be used by hosts that are compliant with
\[[RFC8505](#RFC8505){.xref}\] for address autoconfiguration and
registration.[¶](#section-appendix.i-7){.pilcrow}
