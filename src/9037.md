Deterministic Networking (DetNet) is a service that can be offered by a
network to DetNet flows. DetNet provides these flows with low packet
loss rate and assured maximum end-to-end delivery latency. General
background and concepts of DetNet can be found in
\[[RFC8655](#RFC8655){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

The DetNet architecture decomposes DetNet-related data plane functions
into two sub-layers: a service sub-layer and a forwarding sub-layer. The
service sub-layer is used to provide DetNet service protection and
reordering. The forwarding sub-layer is used to provide congestion
protection (low loss, assured latency, and limited reordering)
leveraging MPLS Traffic Engineering
mechanisms.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC8964](#RFC8964){.xref}\] specifies the DetNet data plane operation
for an MPLS-based PSN. MPLS-encapsulated DetNet flows can be carried
over network technologies that can provide the DetNet-required level of
service. This document focuses on the scenario where MPLS (DetNet) nodes
are interconnected by an IEEE 802.1 TSN sub-network. There is close
cooperation between the IETF DetNet Working Group and the IEEE 802.1
Time-Sensitive Networking Task Group (TSN
TG).[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

The basic approach defined in \[[RFC8964](#RFC8964){.xref}\] supports
the DetNet service sub-layer based on existing PW encapsulations and
mechanisms and supports the DetNet forwarding sub-layer based on
existing MPLS Traffic Engineering encapsulations and
mechanisms.[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

A node operates on a DetNet flow in the DetNet service sub-layer, i.e.,
a node processing a DetNet packet that has the service label (S-Label)
as the top of stack uses the local context associated with that S-Label,
for example, a received forwarding label (F-Label), to determine what
local DetNet operation(s) is applied to that packet. An S-Label may be
unique when taken from the platform label space
\[[RFC3031](#RFC3031){.xref}\], which would enable correct DetNet flow
identification regardless of which input interface or LSP the packet
arrives on. The service sub-layer functions (i.e., PREOF) use a
d-CW.[¶](#section-3-2){.pilcrow}

The DetNet MPLS data plane builds on MPLS Traffic Engineering
encapsulations and mechanisms to provide a forwarding sub-layer that is
responsible for providing resource allocation and explicit routes. The
forwarding sub-layer is supported by one or more
F-Labels.[¶](#section-3-3){.pilcrow}

DetNet edge/relay nodes are DetNet service sub-layer-aware, understand
the particular needs of DetNet flows, and provide both DetNet service
and forwarding sub-layer functions. They add, remove, and process d-CWs,
S-Labels, and F-Labels as needed. MPLS DetNet nodes and transit nodes
include DetNet forwarding sub-layer functions, notable support for
explicit routes, and resource allocation to eliminate (or reduce)
congestion loss and jitter. Unlike other DetNet node types, transit
nodes provide no service sub-layer
processing.[¶](#section-3-4){.pilcrow}

MPLS (DetNet) nodes and transit nodes interconnected by a TSN
sub-network are the primary focus of this document. The mapping of
DetNet MPLS flows to TSN Streams and TSN protection mechanisms are
covered in [Section
4](#mpls-over-tsn){.xref}.[¶](#section-3-5){.pilcrow}

The DetNet WG collaborates with IEEE 802.1 TSN in order to define a
common architecture for both Layer 2 and Layer 3 that maintains
consistency across diverse networks. Both DetNet MPLS and TSN use the
same techniques to provide their deterministic
service:[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

-   [Service protection[¶](#section-4-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-4-2.1}
-   [Resource allocation[¶](#section-4-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-4-2.2}
-   [Explicit routes[¶](#section-4-2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-4-2.3}

As described in the DetNet architecture \[[RFC8655](#RFC8655){.xref}\],
from the MPLS perspective, a sub-network provides a single-hop
connection between MPLS (DetNet) nodes. Functions used for resource
allocation and explicit routes are treated as domain internal functions
and do not require function interworking across the DetNet MPLS network
and the TSN sub-network.[¶](#section-4-3){.pilcrow}

In the case of the service protection function, due to the similarities
of the DetNet PREOF and TSN FRER functions, some level of interworking
is possible. However, such interworking is out of scope of this document
and left for further study.[¶](#section-4-4){.pilcrow}

[Figure 1](#fig_mpls_detnet_to_tsn){.xref} illustrates a scenario where
two MPLS (DetNet) nodes are interconnected by a TSN sub-network. Node-1
is single-homed, and Node-2 is dual-homed to the TSN
sub-network.[¶](#section-4-5){.pilcrow}

Sub-network](#name-detnet-enabled-mpls-network){.selfRef}
:::

At the time of this writing, the TSN TG of the IEEE 802.1 Working Group
have defined (and are defining) a number of amendments to
\[[IEEE8021Q](#IEEE8021Q){.xref}\] that provide zero congestion loss and
bounded latency in bridged networks. Furthermore,
\[[IEEE8021CB](#IEEE8021CB){.xref}\] defines frame replication and
elimination functions for reliability that should prove both compatible
with and useful to DetNet networks. All these functions have to identify
flows that require TSN treatment (i.e., applying TSN functions during
forwarding).[¶](#section-4-7){.pilcrow}

TSN capabilities of the TSN sub-network are made available for MPLS
(DetNet) flows via the protocol interworking function defined in Annex
C.5 of \[[IEEE8021CB](#IEEE8021CB){.xref}\]. For example, when applied
on the TSN edge port, it can convert an ingress unicast MPLS (DetNet)
flow to use a specific Layer 2 multicast destination Media Access
Control (MAC) address and a VLAN, in order to direct the packet through
a specific path inside the bridged network. A similar interworking
function pair at the other end of the TSN sub-network would restore the
packet to its original Layer 2 destination MAC address and
VLAN.[¶](#section-4-8){.pilcrow}

The placement of TSN functions depends on the TSN capabilities of the
nodes along the path. MPLS (DetNet) nodes may or may not support TSN
functions. For a given TSN Stream (i.e., DetNet flow), an MPLS (DetNet)
node is treated as a Talker or a Listener inside the TSN
sub-network.[¶](#section-4-9){.pilcrow}

Mapping of a DetNet MPLS flow to a TSN Stream is provided via the
combination of a passive and an active Stream identification function
that operate at the frame level. The passive Stream identification
function is used to catch the MPLS label(s) of a DetNet MPLS flow, and
the active Stream identification function is used to modify the Ethernet
header according to the ID of the mapped TSN
Stream.[¶](#section-4.1-1){.pilcrow}

Clause 6.8 of \[[IEEEP8021CBdb](#IEEEP8021CBdb){.xref}\] defines a
Mask-and-Match Stream identification function that can be used as a
passive function for MPLS DetNet flows.[¶](#section-4.1-2){.pilcrow}

Clause 6.6 of \[[IEEE8021CB](#IEEE8021CB){.xref}\] defines an Active
Destination MAC and a VLAN Stream identification function that can
replace some Ethernet header fields, namely (1) the destination MAC
address, (2) the VLAN-ID, and (3) priority parameters with alternate
values. Replacement is provided for the frame that is passed either down
the stack from the upper layers or up the stack from the lower
layers.[¶](#section-4.1-3){.pilcrow}

Active Destination MAC and VLAN Stream identification can be used within
a Talker to set flow identity or a Listener to recover the original
addressing information. It can also be used in a TSN bridge that is
providing translation as a proxy service for an end
system.[¶](#section-4.1-4){.pilcrow}

This section covers required behavior of a TSN-aware MPLS (DetNet) node
using a TSN sub-network. The implementation of TSN packet-processing
functions must be compliant with the relevant IEEE 802.1
standards.[¶](#section-4.2-1){.pilcrow}

From the TSN sub-network perspective, MPLS (DetNet) nodes are treated as
a Talker or Listener, which may be (1) TSN-unaware or (2)
TSN-aware.[¶](#section-4.2-2){.pilcrow}

In cases of TSN-unaware MPLS DetNet nodes, the TSN relay nodes within
the TSN sub-network must modify the Ethernet encapsulation of the DetNet
MPLS flow (e.g., MAC translation, VLAN-ID setting, sequence number
addition, etc.) to allow proper TSN-specific handling inside the
sub-network. There are no requirements defined for TSN-unaware MPLS
DetNet nodes in this document.[¶](#section-4.2-3){.pilcrow}

MPLS (DetNet) nodes that are TSN-aware can be treated as a combination
of a TSN-unaware Talker/Listener and a TSN-Relay, as shown in [Figure
2](#fig_mpls_with_tsn){.xref}. In such cases, the MPLS (DetNet) node
must provide the TSN sub-network-specific Ethernet encapsulation over
the link(s) towards the sub-network.[¶](#section-4.2-4){.pilcrow}

A TSN-aware MPLS (DetNet) node implementation must support the Stream
identification TSN component for recognizing
flows.[¶](#section-4.2-6){.pilcrow}

A Stream identification component must be able to instantiate the
following functions: (1) Active Destination MAC and VLAN Stream
identification function, (2) Mask-and-Match Stream identification
function, and (3) the related managed objects in Clause 9 of
\[[IEEE8021CB](#IEEE8021CB){.xref}\] and
\[[IEEEP8021CBdb](#IEEEP8021CBdb){.xref}\].[¶](#section-4.2-7){.pilcrow}

A TSN-aware MPLS (DetNet) node implementation must support the
Sequencing function and the Sequence encode/decode function as defined
in Clauses 7.4 and 7.6 of \[[IEEE8021CB](#IEEE8021CB){.xref}\] in order
for FRER to be used inside the TSN
sub-network.[¶](#section-4.2-8){.pilcrow}

The Sequence encode/decode function must support the Redundancy tag
(R-TAG) format as per Clause 7.8 of
\[[IEEE8021CB](#IEEE8021CB){.xref}\].[¶](#section-4.2-9){.pilcrow}

A TSN-aware MPLS (DetNet) node implementation must support the Stream

### [4.3.](#section-4.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Service Protection within the TSN Sub-network](#name-service-protection-within-t){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-service-protection-within-t}

TSN Streams supporting DetNet flows may use FRER as defined in Clause 8
of \[[IEEE8021CB](#IEEE8021CB){.xref}\] based on the loss service
requirements of the TSN Stream, which is derived from the DetNet service
requirements of the DetNet mapped flow. The specific operation of FRER
is not modified by the use of DetNet and follows
\[[IEEE8021CB](#IEEE8021CB){.xref}\].[¶](#section-4.3-1){.pilcrow}

FRER function and the provided service recovery is available only within
the TSN sub-network as the TSN Stream-ID and the TSN sequence number are
not valid outside the sub-network. An MPLS (DetNet) node represents an
L3 border, and as such, it terminates all related information elements
encoded in the L2 frames.[¶](#section-4.3-2){.pilcrow}

As the Stream-ID and the TSN sequence number are paired with similar
MPLS flow parameters, FRER can be combined with PREOF functions. Such
service protection interworking scenarios may require moving sequence
number fields among TSN (L2) and PW (MPLS) encapsulations, and they are
left for further study.[¶](#section-4.3-3){.pilcrow}

Implementation of this document shall use management and control
information to map a DetNet flow to a TSN Stream. N:1 mapping
(aggregating DetNet flows in a single TSN Stream) shall be supported.
The management or control function that provisions flow mapping shall
ensure that adequate resources are allocated and configured to provide
proper service requirements of the mapped
flows.[¶](#section-4.4-1){.pilcrow}

## [5.](#section-5){.section-number .selfRef} [Management and Control Implications](#name-management-and-control-impl){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-management-and-control-impl}

Information related to DetNet flow and TSN Stream mapping is required
only for TSN-aware MPLS (DetNet) nodes. From the data plane perspective,
there is no practical difference based on the origin of
flow-mapping-related information (management plane or control
plane).[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

The following summarizes the set of information that is needed to
configure DetNet MPLS over TSN:[¶](#section-5-2){.pilcrow}

-   [DetNet MPLS-related configuration information according to the
    DetNet role of the DetNet MPLS node, as per
    \[[RFC8964](#RFC8964){.xref}\].[¶](#section-5-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-5-3.1}
-   [TSN-related configuration information according to the TSN role of
    the DetNet MPLS node, as per \[[IEEE8021Q](#IEEE8021Q){.xref}\],
    \[[IEEE8021CB](#IEEE8021CB){.xref}\], and
    \[[IEEEP8021CBdb](#IEEEP8021CBdb){.xref}\].[¶](#section-5-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-5-3.2}
-   [Mapping between a DetNet MPLS flow(s) (label information: A-Labels,
    S-Labels, and F-Labels as defined in \[[RFC8964](#RFC8964){.xref}\])
    and a TSN Stream(s) (as Stream identification information defined in
    \[[IEEEP8021CBdb](#IEEEP8021CBdb){.xref}\]). Note that managed
    objects for TSN Stream identification can be found in
    \[[IEEEP8021CBcv](#IEEEP8021CBcv){.xref}\].[¶](#section-5-3.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-5-3.3}

This information must be provisioned per DetNet
flow.[¶](#section-5-4){.pilcrow}

Mappings between DetNet and TSN management and control planes are out of
scope of this document. Some of the challenges are highlighted
below.[¶](#section-5-5){.pilcrow}

TSN-aware MPLS DetNet nodes are members of both the DetNet domain and
the TSN sub-network. Within the TSN sub-network, the TSN-aware MPLS
(DetNet) node has a TSN-aware Talker/Listener role, so TSN-specific
management and control plane functionalities must be implemented. There
are many similarities in the management plane techniques used in DetNet
and TSN, but that is not the case for the control plane protocols. For
example, RSVP-TE and the Multiple Stream Registration Protocol (MSRP)
behave differently. Therefore, management and control plane design are
important aspects of scenarios where mapping between DetNet and TSN is
required.[¶](#section-5-6){.pilcrow}

In order to use a TSN sub-network between DetNet nodes, DetNet-specific
information must be converted to information specific to the TSN
sub-network. DetNet flow ID and flow-related parameters/requirements
must be converted to a TSN Stream ID and stream-related
parameters/requirements. Note that, as the TSN sub-network is just a
portion of the end-to-end DetNet path (i.e., a single hop from the MPLS
perspective), some parameters (e.g., delay) may differ significantly.
Other parameters (like bandwidth) also may have to be tuned due to the
L2 encapsulation used within the TSN
sub-network.[¶](#section-5-7){.pilcrow}

In some cases, it may be challenging to determine some
TSN-Stream-related information. For example, on a TSN-aware MPLS
(DetNet) node that acts as a Talker, it is quite obvious which DetNet
node is the Listener of the mapped TSN Stream (i.e., the MPLS next hop).
However, it may be not trivial to locate the point/interface where that
Listener is connected to the TSN sub-network. Such attributes may
require interaction between control and management plane functions and
between DetNet and TSN domains.[¶](#section-5-8){.pilcrow}

Mapping between DetNet flow identifiers and TSN Stream identifiers, if
not provided explicitly, can be done by a TSN-aware MPLS (DetNet) node
locally based on information provided for configuration of the TSN
Stream identification functions (Mask-and-Match Stream identification
and active Stream identification).[¶](#section-5-9){.pilcrow}

Triggering the setup/modification of a TSN Stream in the TSN sub-network
is an example where management and/or control plane interactions are
required between the DetNet and TSN sub-network. TSN-unaware MPLS
(DetNet) nodes make such a triggering even more complicated as they are
fully unaware of the sub-network and run
independently.[¶](#section-5-10){.pilcrow}

Configuration of TSN-specific functions (e.g., FRER) inside the TSN
sub-network is a TSN-domain-specific decision and may not be visible in
the DetNet domain. Service protection interworking scenarios are left
for further study.[¶](#section-5-11){.pilcrow}

## [6.](#section-6){.section-number .selfRef} [Security Considerations](#name-security-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-security-considerations}

Security considerations for DetNet are described in detail in
\[[DETNET-SECURITY](#I-D.ietf-detnet-security){.xref}\]. General
security considerations are described in \[[RFC8655](#RFC8655){.xref}\].
Considerations specific to the DetNet MPLS data plane are summarized in
\[[RFC8964](#RFC8964){.xref}\]. This section considers exclusively
security considerations that are specific to the DetNet MPLS over TSN
sub-network scenario.[¶](#section-6-1){.pilcrow}

The sub-network between DetNet nodes needs to be subject to appropriate
confidentiality. Additionally, knowledge of what DetNet/TSN services are
provided by a sub-network may supply information that can be used in a
variety of security attacks. The ability to modify information exchanges
between connected DetNet nodes may result in bogus operations.
Therefore, it is important that the interface between DetNet nodes and
the TSN sub-network are subject to authorization, authentication, and
encryption.[¶](#section-6-2){.pilcrow}

The TSN sub-network operates at Layer 2, so various security mechanisms
defined by IEEE can be used to secure the connection between the DetNet
nodes (e.g., encryption may be provided using MACsec
