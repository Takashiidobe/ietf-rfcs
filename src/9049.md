# RFC 9049 {#rfcnum}

# Path Aware Networking: Obstacles to Deployment (A Bestiary of Roads Not Taken) {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

This document is a product of the Path Aware Networking Research Group
(PANRG). At the first meeting of the PANRG, the Research Group agreed to
catalog and analyze past efforts to develop and deploy Path Aware
techniques, most of which were unsuccessful or at most partially
successful, in order to extract insights and lessons for Path Aware
networking researchers.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

This document contains that catalog and
analysis.[¶](#section-abstract-2){.pilcrow}

This document describes the lessons that IETF participants have learned
(and learned the hard way) about Path Aware networking over a period of
several decades. It also provides an analysis of reasons why various
Path Aware techniques have seen limited or no
deployment.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

This document represents the consensus of the Path Aware Networking
Research Group (PANRG).[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

::: {#PANdef}
::: {#section-1.1 .section}
### [1.1.](#section-1.1){.section-number .selfRef} [What Do \"Path\" and \"Path Awareness\" Mean in This Document?](#name-what-do-path-and-path-aware){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-what-do-path-and-path-aware}

One of the first questions reviewers of this document have asked is
\"What\'s the definition of a Path, and what\'s the definition of Path
Awareness?\" That is not an easy question to answer for this
document.[¶](#section-1.1-1){.pilcrow}

These terms have definitions in other PANRG documents
\[[PANRG](#PANRG){.xref}\] and are still the subject of some discussion
in the Research Group, as of the date of this document. But because this
document reflects work performed over several decades, the technologies
described in [Section 6](#Contributions){.xref} significantly predate
the current definitions of \"Path\" and \"Path Aware\" in use in the
Path Aware Networking Research Group, and it is unlikely that all the
contributors to [Section 6](#Contributions){.xref} would have had the
same understanding of these terms. Those technologies were considered
\"Path Aware\" in early PANRG discussions and so are included in this
retrospective document.[¶](#section-1.1-2){.pilcrow}

It is worth noting that the definitions of \"Path\" and \"Path Aware\"
in \[[PANRG-PATH-PROPERTIES](#I-D.irtf-panrg-path-properties){.xref}\]
would apply to Path Aware techniques at a number of levels of the
Internet protocol architecture (\[[RFC1122](#RFC1122){.xref}\], plus
several decades of refinements), but the contributions received for this
document tended to target the transport layer and to treat a \"Path\"
constructed by routers as opaque. It would be useful to consider how
applicable the Lessons Learned cataloged in this document are, at other
layers, and that would be a fine topic for follow-on
research.[¶](#section-1.1-3){.pilcrow}

The current definition of \"Path\" in the Path Aware Networking Research
Group appears in Section 2 (\"Terminology\") in
\[[PANRG-PATH-PROPERTIES](#I-D.irtf-panrg-path-properties){.xref}\].
That definition is included here as a convenience to the
reader.[¶](#section-1.1-4){.pilcrow}

> Path: A sequence of adjacent path elements over which a packet can be
> transmitted, starting and ending with a node. A path is
> unidirectional. Paths are time-dependent, i.e., the sequence of path
> elements over which packets are sent from one node to another may
> change. A path is defined between two nodes. For multicast or
> broadcast, a packet may be sent by one node and received by multiple
> nodes. In this case, the packet is sent over multiple paths at once,
> one path for each combination of sending and receiving node; these
> paths do not have to be disjoint. Note that an entity may have only
> partial visibility of the path elements that comprise a path and
> visibility may change over time. Different entities may have different
> visibility of a path and/or treat path elements at different levels of
> abstraction.[¶](#section-1.1-5){.pilcrow}

The current definition of Path Awareness, used by the Path Aware
Networking Research Group, appears in Section 1.1 (\"Definition\") in
\[[PANRG-QUESTIONS](#I-D.irtf-panrg-questions){.xref}\]. That definition
is included here as a convenience to the
reader.[¶](#section-1.1-6){.pilcrow}

> For purposes of this document, \"path aware networking\" describes
> endpoint discovery of the properties of paths they use for
> communication across an internetwork, and endpoint reaction to these
> properties that affects routing and/or data transfer. Note that this
> can and already does happen to some extent in the current Internet
> architecture; this definition expands current techniques of path
> discovery and manipulation to cross administrative domain boundaries
> and up to the transport and application layers at the
> endpoints.[¶](#section-1.1-7.1){.pilcrow}
>
> Expanding on this definition, a \"path aware internetwork\" is one in
> which endpoint discovery of path properties and endpoint selection of
> paths used by traffic exchanged by the endpoint are explicitly
> supported, regardless of the specific design of the protocol features
> which enable this discovery and
> selection.[¶](#section-1.1-7.2){.pilcrow}

At the first meeting of the Path Aware Networking Research Group
\[[PANRG](#PANRG){.xref}\], at IETF 99 \[[PANRG-99](#PANRG-99){.xref}\],
Olivier Bonaventure led a discussion of \"A Decade of Path Awareness\"
\[[PATH-Decade](#PATH-Decade){.xref}\], on attempts, which were mostly
unsuccessful for a variety of reasons, to exploit Path Aware techniques
and achieve a variety of goals over the past decade. At the end of that
discussion, two things were abundantly clear.[¶](#section-2-1){.pilcrow}

-   [The Internet community has accumulated considerable experience with
    many Path Aware techniques over a long period of time,
    and[¶](#section-2-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-2-2.1}
-   [Although some Path Aware techniques have been deployed (for
    example, Differentiated Services, or Diffserv
    \[[RFC2475](#RFC2475){.xref}\]), most of these techniques haven\'t
    seen widespread adoption and deployment. Even \"successful\"
    techniques like Diffserv can face obstacles that prevent wider
    usage. The reasons for non-adoption and limited adoption and
    deployment are many and are worthy of
    study.[¶](#section-2-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-2-2.2}

The meta-lessons from that experience were as
follows:[¶](#section-2-3){.pilcrow}

-   [Path Aware networking has been more Research than Engineering, so
    establishing an IRTF Research Group for Path Aware networking was
    the right thing to do
    \[[RFC7418](#RFC7418){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2-4.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-2-4.1}
-   [Analyzing a catalog of past experience to learn the reasons for
    non-adoption would be a great first step for the Research
    Group.[¶](#section-2-4.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-2-4.2}

Allison Mankin, as IRTF Chair, officially chartered the Path Aware
Networking Research Group in July 2018.[¶](#section-2-5){.pilcrow}

This document contains the analysis performed by that Research Group

This Informational document discusses Path Aware protocol mechanisms
considered, and in some cases standardized, by the Internet Engineering
Task Force (IETF), and it considers Lessons Learned from those
mechanisms. The intention is to inform the work of protocol designers,
whether in the IRTF, the IETF, or elsewhere in the Internet
ecosystem.[¶](#section-2.1-1){.pilcrow}

has no authority beyond the quality of the analysis it

This document does not catalog every proposed Path Aware technique that
was not adopted and deployed. Instead, we limited our focus to
technologies that passed through the IETF community and still identified
enough techniques to provide background for the lessons included in
[Section 4](#LessonsLearned){.xref} to inform researchers and protocol
engineers in their work.[¶](#section-2.2-1){.pilcrow}

No shame is intended for the techniques included in this document. As
shown in [Section 4](#LessonsLearned){.xref}, the quality of specific
techniques had little to do with whether they were deployed or not.
Based on the techniques cataloged in this document, it is likely that
when these techniques were put forward, the proponents were trying to
engineer something that could not be engineered without first carrying
out research. Actual shame would be failing to learn from experience and
failing to share that experience with other networking researchers and
engineers.[¶](#section-2.2-2){.pilcrow}

As background for understanding the Lessons Learned contained in this
document, the reader is encouraged to become familiar with the Internet
Architecture Board\'s documents on \"[What Makes for a Successful
Protocol?](#RFC5218){.xref}\" \[[RFC5218](#RFC5218){.xref}\] and
\"[Planning for Protocol Adoption and Subsequent
Transitions](#RFC8170){.xref}\"
\[[RFC8170](#RFC8170){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2.3-1){.pilcrow}

Although these two documents do not specifically target Path Aware
networking protocols, they are helpful resources for readers seeking to
improve their understanding of considerations for successful adoption
and deployment of any protocol. For example, the basic success factors
described in [Section
2.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5218#section-2.1){.relref} of
\[[RFC5218](#RFC5218){.xref}\] are helpful for readers of this
document.[¶](#section-2.3-2){.pilcrow}

Because there is an economic aspect to decisions about deployment, the
IAB Workshop on Internet Technology Adoption and Transition
\[[ITAT](#ITAT){.xref}\] report \[[RFC7305](#RFC7305){.xref}\] also
provides food for thought.[¶](#section-2.3-3){.pilcrow}

Several of the Lessons Learned in [Section 4](#LessonsLearned){.xref}
reflect considerations described in \[[RFC5218](#RFC5218){.xref}\],

6](#Contributions){.xref} predate the initial scope. The earliest Path
Aware technique referred to in [Section 6](#Contributions){.xref} is
\[[IEN-119](#IEN-119){.xref}\], which was published in the late 1970s;
see [Section 6.1](#ST2){.xref}. Given that the networking ecosystem has
evolved continuously, it seems reasonable to consider how to apply these
lessons.[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

of this document at IETF 105 \[[PANRG-105-Min](#PANRG-105-Min){.xref}\]
and carried out additional discussion at IETF 106
\[[PANRG-106-Min](#PANRG-106-Min){.xref}\]. [Table 1](#thefuture){.xref}

For \"Outperforming End-to-End Protocol Mechanisms\", there is a
trade-off between improved performance from Path Aware techniques and
additional complexity required by some Path Aware
techniques.[¶](#section-3-8){.pilcrow}

-   [For example, if you can obtain the same understanding of path
    characteristics from measurements obtained over a few more round

    intermediate nodes as a single connection has become more common, so
    that additional end-to-end connections don\'t add additional state
    to intermediate nodes between tunnel endpoints. If these tunnels are
    encrypted, intermediate nodes between tunnel endpoints can\'t
    distinguish between connections, even if that were
    desirable.[¶](#section-3-11.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-11.1}

This section summarizes the Lessons Learned from the contributed

Each Lesson Learned is tagged with one or more contributions that

It is useful to notice that sometimes an obstacle might impede
deployment, while at other times, the same obstacle might prevent
adoption and deployment entirely. The Research Group discussed
distinguishing between obstacles that impede and obstacles that prevent,
but it appears that the boundary between \"impede\" and \"prevent\" can
shift over time \-- some of the Lessons Learned are based on both a)
Path Aware techniques that were not deployed and b) Path Aware
techniques that were deployed but were not deployed widely or quickly.

The benefit of Path Awareness must be great enough to justify making
changes in an operational network. The colloquial U.S. American English
expression, \"If it ain\'t broke, don\'t fix it\" is a \"best current
practice\" on today\'s Internet. (See

Providing benefits for early adopters can be key \-- if everyone must
deploy a technique in order for the technique to provide benefits, or
even to work at all, the technique is unlikely to be adopted widely or
quickly. (See Sections [6.2](#IntServ){.xref} and

Some proposals require that all path elements along the full length of
the path must be upgraded to support a new technique, before any
benefits can be seen. This is likely to require coordination between
operators who control a subset of path elements, and between operators
and end users if endpoint upgrades are required. If a technique provides
benefits when only a part of the path has been upgraded, this is likely
to encourage adoption and deployment. (See
Sections [6.2](#IntServ){.xref}, [6.3](#Quick-Start){.xref}, and

Adaptive end-to-end protocol mechanisms may respond to feedback quickly
enough that the additional realizable benefit from a new Path Aware
mechanism that tries to manipulate nodes along a path, or observe the
attributes of nodes along a path, may be much smaller than anticipated.

\"Follow the money.\" If operators can\'t charge for a Path Aware
technique to recover the costs of deploying it, the benefits to the
operator must be really significant. Corollary: if operators charge for
a Path Aware technique, the benefits to users of that Path Aware
technique must be significant enough to justify the cost. (See

The impact of a Path Aware technique requiring changes to operational
practices can affect how quickly or widely a promising technique is
deployed. The impacts of these changes may make deployment more likely,
but they often discourage deployment. (See [Section 6.6](#Shim6){.xref},

Per-connection state in intermediate nodes has been an impediment to
adoption and deployment in the past, because of added cost and
complexity. Often, similar benefits can be achieved with much less
finely grained state. This is especially true as we move from the edge
of the network, further into the routing core. (See

Many modern platforms, especially high-end routers, have been designed
with hardware that can make simple per-packet forwarding decisions
(\"fast paths\") but have not been designed to make heavy use of in-band
mechanisms such as IPv4 and IPv6 Router Alert Options (RAOs) that
require more processing to make forwarding decisions. Packets carrying
in-band mechanisms are diverted to other processors in the router with
much lower packet-processing rates. Operators can be reluctant to deploy
techniques that rely heavily on in-band mechanisms because they may
significantly reduce packet throughput. (See [Section

If intermediate nodes along the path can\'t be trusted, it\'s unlikely
that endpoints will rely on signals from intermediate nodes to drive
changes to endpoint behaviors. We note that \"trust\" is not binary \--
one low level of trust applies when a node receiving a message can
confirm that the sender of the message has visibility of the packets on
the path it is seeking to control \[[RFC8085](#RFC8085){.xref}\] (e.g.,
an ICMP Destination Unreachable message \[[RFC0792](#RFC0792){.xref}\]
that includes the Internet Header + 64 bits of Original Data Datagram
payload from the source). A higher level of trust can arise when an
endpoint has established a short-term, or even long-term, trust
relationship with network nodes. (See

If the endpoints do not have any trust relationship with the
intermediate nodes along a path, operators have been reluctant to deploy
techniques that rely on endpoints sending unauthenticated control
signals to routers. (See Sections [6.2](#IntServ){.xref} and

Because the Internet is a distributed system, if the distance that
information from distant path elements travels to a Path Aware host is
sufficiently large, the information may no longer accurately represent
the state and situation at the distant host or elements along the path
when it is received locally. In this case, the benefit that a Path Aware
technique provides will be inconsistent and may not always be
beneficial. (See [Section

Just because a protocol stack provides a new feature/signal does not
mean that applications will use the feature/signal. Protocol stacks may
not know how to effectively utilize Path Aware techniques, because the
protocol stack may require information from applications to permit the
technique to work effectively, but applications may not a priori know
that information. Even if the application does know that information,
the de facto sockets API has no way of signaling application
expectations for the network path to the protocol stack. In order for
applications to provide these expectations to protocol stacks, we need
an API that signals more than the packets to be sent. (See

If early implementers discover severe problems with a new feature, that
feature is likely to be disabled, and convincing implementers to
re-enable that feature can be very difficult and can require years or
decades. In addition to testing, partial deployment for a subset of
users, implementing instrumentation that will detect degraded user
experience, and even \"failback\" to a previous version or \"failover\"

    \[[RFC8655](#RFC8655){.xref}\]) is the ability to \"say no\" to an
    application based on resource availability on a path, before the
    application tries to inject traffic onto that path and discovers the
    path does not have the capacity to sustain enough utility to meet
    the application\'s minimum needs. The question of whether admission
    control is needed comes up repeatedly, but we have learned a few
    useful lessons that, while covered implicitly in some of the Lessons
    Learned provided in this document, might be explained
    explicitly:[¶](#section-5-2.2.1){.pilcrow}

    -   [We have gained a lot of experience with application-based
        adaptation since the days where applications just injected
        traffic inelastically into the network. Such adaptations seem to
        work well enough that admission control is of less value to
        these
        applications.[¶](#section-5-2.2.2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-5-2.2.2.1}
    -   [There are end-to-end measurement techniques that can steer
        traffic at the application layer (Content Delivery Networks

    -   [We noted in [Section 4.12](#ProtocolStackSupport){.xref} that

The first version of Stream Transport, ST
\[[IEN-119](#IEN-119){.xref}\], was published in the late 1970s and was
implemented and deployed on the ARPANET at small scale. It was used
throughout the 1980s for experimental transmission of voice, video, and
distributed simulation.[¶](#section-6.1-3){.pilcrow}

The second version of the ST specification (ST2)
\[[RFC1190](#RFC1190){.xref}\] \[[RFC1819](#RFC1819){.xref}\] was an
experimental connection-oriented internetworking protocol that operated
at the same layer as connectionless IP. ST2 packets could be
distinguished by their IP header version numbers (IP, at that time, used
version number 4, while ST2 used version number
5).[¶](#section-6.1-4){.pilcrow}

ST2 used a control plane layered over IP to select routes and reserve
capacity for real-time streams across a network path, based on a flow
specification communicated by a separate protocol. The flow
specification could be associated with QoS state in routers, producing
an experimental resource reservation protocol. This allowed ST2 routers
along a path to offer end-to-end guarantees, primarily to satisfy the
QoS requirements for real-time services over the
Internet.[¶](#section-6.1-5){.pilcrow}

As time passed, the trade-off between router processing and link

became comparatively more expensive.[¶](#section-6.1.2-1){.pilcrow}

The ST2 control protocol used \"hard state\" \-- once a route was
established, and resources were reserved, routes and resources existed
until they were explicitly released via signaling. A soft-state approach
was thought superior to this hard-state approach and led to development

In 1994, when the IntServ architecture document
\[[RFC1633](#RFC1633){.xref}\] was published, real-time traffic was
first appearing on the Internet. At that time, bandwidth was still a
scarce commodity. Internet Service Providers built networks over DS3 (45
Mbps) infrastructure, and sub-rate (\< 1 Mbps) access was common.
Therefore, the IETF anticipated a need for a fine-grained QoS
mechanism.[¶](#section-6.2-3){.pilcrow}

In the IntServ architecture, some applications can require service
guarantees. Therefore, those applications use RSVP
\[[RFC2205](#RFC2205){.xref}\] to signal QoS reservations across network
paths. Every router in the network that participates in IntServ
maintains per-flow soft state to a) perform call admission control and
b) deliver guaranteed service.[¶](#section-6.2-4){.pilcrow}

Although IntServ has been used in enterprise and government networks,
IntServ was never widely deployed on the Internet because of its cost.
The following factors contributed to operational
cost:[¶](#section-6.2.1-1){.pilcrow}

-   [IntServ must be deployed on every router that is on a path where
    IntServ is to be used. Although it is possible to include a router
    that does not participate in IntServ along the path being
    controlled, if that router is likely to become a bottleneck, IntServ
    cannot be used to avoid that bottleneck along the

occurred:[¶](#section-6.2.1-3){.pilcrow}

-   [For many expected uses, it became more cost effective to solve the
    QoS problem by adding bandwidth. Between 1994 and 2000, Internet
    Service Providers upgraded their infrastructures from DS3 (45 Mbps)
    to OC-48 (2.4 Gbps). This meant that even if an endpoint was using
    IntServ in an IntServ-enabled network, its requests would rarely, if
    ever, be denied, so endpoints and Internet Service Providers had
    little reason to enable

The following lessons were learned:[¶](#section-6.2.2-1){.pilcrow}

-   [Any mechanism that requires every participating on-path router to
    maintain per-flow state is not likely to succeed, unless the
    additional cost for offering the feature can be recovered from the
    user.[¶](#section-6.2.2-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.2.2-2.1}

In environments where IntServ has been deployed, trust relationships
with endpoints are very different from trust relationships on the
Internet itself. There are often clearly defined hierarchies in Service
Level Agreements (SLAs) governing well-defined transport flows operating
with predetermined capacity and latency requirements over paths where
capacity or other attributes are
constrained.[¶](#section-6.2.2-3){.pilcrow}

IntServ was never widely deployed to manage capacity across the
Internet. However, the technique that it produced was deployed for
reasons other than bandwidth management. RSVP is widely deployed as an
MPLS signaling mechanism. BGP reuses the RSVP concept of Filter Specs to
distribute firewall filters, although they are called \"Flow Spec
Component Types\" in BGP

Quick-Start is defined in an Experimental RFC
\[[RFC4782](#RFC4782){.xref}\] and is a TCP extension that leverages
support from the routers on the path to determine an allowed initial
sending rate for a path through the Internet, either at the start of
data transfers or after idle periods. Without information about the
path, a sender cannot easily determine an appropriate initial sending
rate. The default TCP congestion control therefore uses the safe but
time-consuming slow-start algorithm \[[RFC5681](#RFC5681){.xref}\]. With
Quick-Start, connections are allowed to use higher initial sending rates
if there is significant unused bandwidth along the path and if the
sender and all of the routers along the path approve the
request.[¶](#section-6.3-3){.pilcrow}

By examining the Time To Live (TTL) field in Quick-Start packets, a
sender can determine if routers on the path have approved the
Quick-Start request. However, this method is unable to take into account
the routers hidden by tunnels or other network nodes invisible at the IP
layer.[¶](#section-6.3-4){.pilcrow}

The protocol also includes a nonce that provides protection against
cheating routers and receivers. If the Quick-Start request is explicitly
approved by all routers along the path, the TCP host can send at up to
the approved rate; otherwise, TCP would use the default congestion
control. Quick-Start requires modifications in the involved end systems
as well as in routers. Due to the resulting deployment challenges,
Quick-Start was only proposed in \[[RFC4782](#RFC4782){.xref}\] for
controlled environments.[¶](#section-6.3-5){.pilcrow}

The Quick-Start mechanism is a lightweight, coarse-grained, in-band,
network-assisted fast startup mechanism. The benefits are studied by
simulation in a research paper \[[SAF07](#SAF07){.xref}\] that
complements the protocol specification. The study confirms that
Quick-Start can significantly speed up mid-sized data transfers. That
paper also presents router algorithms that do not require keeping
per-flow state. Later studies \[[Sch11](#Sch11){.xref}\] comprehensively
analyze Quick-Start with a full Linux implementation and with a router
fast-path prototype using a network processor. In both cases,
Quick-Start could be implemented with limited additional
complexity.[¶](#section-6.3-6){.pilcrow}

However, experiments with Quick-Start in \[[Sch11](#Sch11){.xref}\]
revealed several challenges:[¶](#section-6.3.1-1){.pilcrow}

-   [Having information from the routers along the path can reduce the
    risk of congestion but cannot avoid it entirely. Determining whether
    there is unused capacity is not trivial in actual router and host
    implementations. Data about available capacity visible at the IP
    layer may be imprecise, and due to the propagation delay,
    information can already be outdated when it reaches a sender. There
    is a trade-off between the speedup of data transfers and the risk of
    congestion even with Quick-Start. This could be mitigated by only
    allowing Quick-Start to access a proportion of the unused capacity
    along a path.[¶](#section-6.3.1-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.3.1-2.1}
-   [For scalable router fast-path implementations, it is important to
    enable parallel processing of packets, as this is a widely used
    method, e.g., in network processors. One challenge is
    synchronization of information between packets that are processed in
    parallel, which should be avoided as much as
    possible.[¶](#section-6.3.1-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.3.1-2.2}
-   [Only some types of application traffic can benefit from
    Quick-Start. Capacity needs to be requested and discovered. The
    discovered capacity needs to be utilized by the flow, or it
    implicitly becomes available for other flows. Failing to use the
    requested capacity may have already reduced the pool of Quick-Start
    capacity that was made available to other competing Quick-Start
    requests. The benefit is greatest when senders use this only for
    bulk flows and avoid sending unnecessary Quick-Start requests, e.g.,
    for flows that only send a small amount of data. Choosing an
    appropriate request size requires application-internal knowledge
    that is not commonly expressed by the transport API. How a sender
    can determine the rate for an initial Quick-Start request is still a
    largely unsolved
    problem.[¶](#section-6.3.1-2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.3.1-2.3}

Some lessons can be learned from Quick-Start. Despite being a very
lightweight protocol, Quick-Start suffers from poor incremental
deployment properties regarding both a) the required modifications in
network infrastructure and b) its interactions with applications. Except
for corner cases, congestion control can be quite efficiently performed
end to end in the Internet, and in modern stacks there is not much room
for significant improvement by additional network
support.[¶](#section-6.3.2-1){.pilcrow}

After publication of the Quick-Start specification, there have been
large-scale experiments with an initial window of up to 10 segments
\[[RFC6928](#RFC6928){.xref}\]. This alternative \"IW10\" approach can
also ramp up data transfers faster than the standard congestion control,
but it only requires sender-side modifications. As a result, this
approach can be easier and incrementally deployed in the Internet. While
theoretically Quick-Start can outperform \"IW10\", the improvement in
completion time for data transfer times can, in many cases, be small.
After publication of \[[RFC6928](#RFC6928){.xref}\], most modern TCP
stacks have increased their default initial
window.[¶](#section-6.3.2-2){.pilcrow}

The ICMP Source Quench message \[[RFC0792](#RFC0792){.xref}\] allowed an
on-path router to request the source of a flow to reduce its sending
rate. This method allowed a router to provide an early indication of
impending congestion on a path to the sources that contribute to that
congestion.[¶](#section-6.4-3){.pilcrow}

This method was deployed in Internet routers over a period of time; the
reaction of endpoints to receiving this signal has varied. For low-speed
links, with low multiplexing of flows the method could be used to
regulate (momentarily reduce) the transmission rate. However, the simple
signal does not scale with link speed or with the number of flows
sharing a link.[¶](#section-6.4.1-1){.pilcrow}

The approach was overtaken by the evolution of congestion control
methods in TCP \[[RFC2001](#RFC2001){.xref}\], and later also by other
IETF transports. Because these methods were based upon measurement of
the end-to-end path and an algorithm in the endpoint, they were able to
evolve and mature more rapidly than methods relying on interactions
between operational routers and endpoint
stacks.[¶](#section-6.4.1-2){.pilcrow}

After ICMP Source Quench was specified, the IETF began to recommend that
transports provide end-to-end congestion control
\[[RFC2001](#RFC2001){.xref}\]. The Source Quench method has been
obsoleted by the IETF \[[RFC6633](#RFC6633){.xref}\], and both hosts and
routers must now silently discard this
message.[¶](#section-6.4.1-3){.pilcrow}

#### [6.4.2.](#section-6.4.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Lessons Learned](#name-lessons-learned-4){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-lessons-learned-4}

This method had several problems.[¶](#section-6.4.2-1){.pilcrow}

First, \[[RFC0792](#RFC0792){.xref}\] did not sufficiently specify how
the sender would react to the ICMP Source Quench signal from the path
(e.g., \[[RFC1016](#RFC1016){.xref}\]). There was ambiguity in how the
sender should utilize this additional information. This could lead to
unfairness in the way that receivers (or routers) responded to this
message.[¶](#section-6.4.2-2){.pilcrow}

Second, while the message did provide additional information, the
Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) mechanism
\[[RFC3168](#RFC3168){.xref}\] provided a more robust and informative
signal for network nodes to provide early indication that a path has
become congested.[¶](#section-6.4.2-3){.pilcrow}

The mechanism originated at a time when the Internet trust model was
very different. Most endpoint implementations did not attempt to verify
that the message originated from an on-path node before they utilized
the message. This made it vulnerable to Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks.
In theory, routers might have chosen to use the quoted packet contained
in the ICMP payload to validate that the message originated from an
on-path node, but this would have increased per-packet processing
overhead for each router along the path and would have required
transport functionality in the router to verify whether the quoted
packet header corresponded to a packet the router had sent. In addition,
[Section
5.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4443#section-5.2){.relref} of
\[[RFC4443](#RFC4443){.xref}\] noted ICMPv6-based attacks on hosts that
would also have threatened routers processing ICMPv6 Source Quench
payloads. As time passed, it became increasingly obvious that the lack
of validation of the messages exposed receivers to a security
vulnerability where the messages could be forged to create a tangible
DoS opportunity.[¶](#section-6.4.2-4){.pilcrow}

TCP \[[RFC0793](#RFC0793){.xref}\] has a well-known weakness \-- the
end-to-end flow control mechanism has only a single signal, the loss of
a segment, detected when no acknowledgment for the lost segment is
received at the sender. There are multiple reasons why the sender might
not have received an acknowledgment for the segment. To name several,
the segment could have been trapped in a routing loop, damaged in
transmission and failed checksum verification at the receiver, or lost
because some intermediate device discarded the packet, or any of a
variety of other things could have happened to the acknowledgment on the
way back from the receiver to the sender. TCP implementations since the
late 1980s have made the \"safe\" decision and have interpreted the loss
of a segment as evidence that the path between two endpoints may have
become congested enough to exhaust buffers on intermediate hops, so that
the TCP sender should \"back off\" \-- reduce its sending rate until it
knows that its segments are now being delivered without loss
\[[RFC5681](#RFC5681){.xref}\].[¶](#section-6.5-3){.pilcrow}

The thinking behind TRIGTRAN was that if a path completely stopped
working because a link along the path was \"down\", somehow something
along the path could signal TCP when that link returned to service, and
the sending TCP could retry immediately, without waiting for a full
retransmission timeout (RTO) period.[¶](#section-6.5-4){.pilcrow}

The early dreams for TRIGTRAN were dashed because of an assumption that
TRIGTRAN triggers would be unauthenticated. This meant that any \"safe\"
TRIGTRAN mechanism would have relied on a mechanism such as setting the
IPv4 TTL or IPv6 Hop Count to 255 at a sender and testing that it was
254 upon receipt, so that a receiver could verify that a signal was
generated by an adjacent sender known to be on the path being used and
not some unknown sender that might not even be on the path (e.g., \"[The
Generalized TTL Security Mechanism (GTSM)](#RFC5082){.xref}\"
\[[RFC5082](#RFC5082){.xref}\]). This situation is very similar to the
case for ICMP Source Quench messages as described in [Section
6.4](#Source-Quench){.xref}, which were also unauthenticated and could
be sent by an off-path attacker, resulting in deprecation of ICMP Source
Quench message processing
\[[RFC6633](#RFC6633){.xref}\].[¶](#section-6.5.1-1){.pilcrow}

TRIGTRAN\'s scope shrunk from \"the path is down\" to \"the first-hop
link is down.\"[¶](#section-6.5.1-2){.pilcrow}

But things got worse.[¶](#section-6.5.1-3){.pilcrow}

Because TRIGTRAN triggers would only be provided when the first-hop link
was \"down\", TRIGTRAN triggers couldn\'t replace normal TCP
retransmission behavior if the path failed because some link further
along the network path was \"down\". So TRIGTRAN triggers added
complexity to an already-complex TCP state machine and did not allow any
existing complexity to be removed.[¶](#section-6.5.1-4){.pilcrow}

There was also an issue that the TRIGTRAN signal was not sent in
response to a specific host that had been sending packets and was
instead a signal that stimulated a response by any sender on the link.
This needs to scale when there are multiple flows trying to use the same
resource, yet the sender of a trigger has no understanding of how many
of the potential traffic sources will respond by sending packets \-- if
recipients of the signal \"back off\" their responses to a trigger to
improve scaling, then that immediately mitigates the benefit of the
signal.[¶](#section-6.5.1-5){.pilcrow}

Finally, intermediate forwarding nodes required modification to provide
TRIGTRAN triggers, but operators couldn\'t charge for TRIGTRAN triggers,
so there was no way to recover the cost of modifying, testing, and
deploying updated intermediate nodes.[¶](#section-6.5.1-6){.pilcrow}

Two TRIGTRAN BOFs were held, at IETF 55
\[[TRIGTRAN-55](#TRIGTRAN-55){.xref}\] and IETF 56

The reasons why this work was not chartered, much less deployed, provide
several useful lessons for researchers.[¶](#section-6.5.2-1){.pilcrow}

-   [TRIGTRAN started with a plausible value proposition, but networking
    realities in the early 2000s forced reductions in scope that led
    directly to reductions in potential benefits but no corresponding
    reductions in costs and
    complexity.[¶](#section-6.5.2-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.5.2-2.1}
-   [These reductions in scope were the direct result of an inability
    for hosts to trust or authenticate TRIGTRAN signals they received
    from the
    network.[¶](#section-6.5.2-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.5.2-2.2}
-   [Operators did not believe they could charge for TRIGTRAN signaling,
    because first-hop links didn\'t fail frequently and TRIGTRAN
    provided no reduction in operating expenses, so there was little
    incentive to purchase and deploy TRIGTRAN-capable network
    equipment.[¶](#section-6.5.2-2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.5.2-2.3}

It is also worth noting that the targeted environment for TRIGTRAN in
the late 1990s contained links with a relatively small number of
directly connected hosts \-- for instance, cellular or satellite links.
The transport community was well aware of the dangers of sender
synchronization based on multiple senders receiving the same stimulus at
the same time, but the working assumption for TRIGTRAN was that there
wouldn\'t be enough senders for this to be a meaningful problem. In the
2010s, it was common for a single \"link\" to support many senders and
receivers, likely requiring TRIGTRAN senders to wait some random amount
of time before sending after receiving a TRIGTRAN signal, which would
have reduced the benefits of TRIGTRAN even
more.[¶](#section-6.5.2-3){.pilcrow}

    \[[RFC5533](#RFC5533){.xref}\][¶](#section-6.6-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.6-2.1}

The IPv6 routing architecture \[[RFC1887](#RFC1887){.xref}\] assumed
that most sites on the Internet would be identified by Provider Assigned
IPv6 prefixes, so that Default-Free Zone routers only contained routes
to other providers, resulting in a very small IPv6 global routing
table.[¶](#section-6.6-3){.pilcrow}

For a single-homed site, this could work well. A multihomed site with
only one upstream provider could also work well, although BGP
multihoming from a single upstream provider was often a premium service
(costing more than twice as much as two single-homed sites), and if the
single upstream provider went out of service, all of the multihomed
paths could fail simultaneously.[¶](#section-6.6-4){.pilcrow}

IPv4 sites often multihomed by obtaining Provider Independent prefixes
and advertising these prefixes through multiple upstream providers. With
the assumption that any multihomed IPv4 site would also multihome in
IPv6, it seemed likely that IPv6 routing would be subject to the same
pressures to announce Provider Independent prefixes, resulting in an
IPv6 global routing table that exhibited the same explosive growth as
the IPv4 global routing table. During the early 2000s, work began on a
protocol that would provide multihoming for IPv6 sites without requiring
sites to advertise Provider Independent prefixes into the IPv6 global
routing table.[¶](#section-6.6-5){.pilcrow}

This protocol, called \"Shim6\", allowed two endpoints to exchange
multiple addresses (\"Locators\") that all mapped to the same endpoint
(\"Identity\"). After an endpoint learned multiple Locators for the
other endpoint, it could send to any of those Locators with the
expectation that those packets would all be delivered to the endpoint
with the same Identity. Shim6 was an example of an \"Identity/Locator
Split\" protocol.[¶](#section-6.6-6){.pilcrow}

Shim6, as defined in \[[RFC5533](#RFC5533){.xref}\] and related RFCs,
provided a workable solution for IPv6 multihoming using Provider
Assigned prefixes, including capability discovery and negotiation, and
allowing end-to-end application communication to continue even in the
face of path failure, because applications don\'t see Locator failures
and continue to communicate with the same Identity using a different
Locator.[¶](#section-6.6-7){.pilcrow}

Note that the problem being addressed was \"site multihoming\", but
Shim6 was providing \"host multihoming\". That meant that the decision
about what path would be used was under host control, not under edge
router control.[¶](#section-6.6.1-1){.pilcrow}

Although more work could have been done to provide a better technical
solution, the biggest impediments to Shim6 deployment were operational
and business considerations. These impediments were discussed at
multiple network operator group meetings, including
\[[Shim6-35](#Shim6-35){.xref}\] at
\[[NANOG-35](#NANOG-35){.xref}\].[¶](#section-6.6.1-2){.pilcrow}

The technical issues centered around concerns that Shim6 relied on the
host to track all the connections, while also tracking Identity/Locator
mappings in the kernel and tracking failures to recognize that an
available path has failed.[¶](#section-6.6.1-3){.pilcrow}

The operational issues centered around concerns that operators were
performing traffic engineering on traffic aggregates. With Shim6, these
operator traffic engineering policies must be pushed down to individual
hosts.[¶](#section-6.6.1-4){.pilcrow}

In addition, operators would have no visibility or control over the
decision of hosts choosing to switch to another path. They expressed
concerns that relying on hosts to steer traffic exposed operator
networks to oscillation based on feedback loops, if hosts moved from
path to path frequently. Given that Shim6 was intended to support
multihoming across operators, operators providing only one of the paths
would have even less visibility as traffic suddenly appeared and
disappeared on their networks.[¶](#section-6.6.1-5){.pilcrow}

In addition, firewalls that expected to find a TCP or UDP
transport-level protocol header in the IP payload would see a Shim6
Identity header instead, and they would not perform
transport-protocol-based firewalling functions because the firewall\'s
normal processing logic would not look past the Identity header. The
firewall would perform its default action, which would most likely be to
drop packets that don\'t match any processing
rule.[¶](#section-6.6.1-6){.pilcrow}

The business issues centered on reducing or removing the ability to sell
BGP multihoming service to their own customers, which is often more
expensive than two single-homed connectivity
services.[¶](#section-6.6.1-7){.pilcrow}

expressed concerns that customers could use Multipath TCP to load-share
TCP connections across operators simultaneously and compare passive
performance measurements across network paths in real time, changing the
balance of power in those business relationships. Although the Multipath
TCP Working Group was chartered, this concern could have acted as an
obstacle to deployment.[¶](#section-6.6.3-1){.pilcrow}

The NSIS Working Group worked on signaling techniques for network-layer
resources (e.g., QoS resource reservations, Firewall and NAT
traversal).[¶](#section-6.7-3){.pilcrow}

When RSVP \[[RFC2205](#RFC2205){.xref}\] was used in deployments, a
number of questions came up about its perceived limitations and
potential missing features. The issues noted in the NSIS Working Group
charter \[[NSIS-CHARTER-2001](#NSIS-CHARTER-2001){.xref}\] include
interworking between domains with different QoS architectures, mobility
and roaming for IP interfaces, and complexity. Later, the lack of
security in RSVP was also recognized
\[[RFC4094](#RFC4094){.xref}\].[¶](#section-6.7-4){.pilcrow}

The NSIS Working Group was chartered to tackle those issues and
initially focused on QoS signaling as its primary use case. However,
over time a new approach evolved that introduced a modular architecture
using two application-specific signaling protocols: a) the NSIS
Signaling Layer Protocol (NSLP) on top of b) a generic signaling
transport protocol (the NSIS Transport Layer Protocol
(NTLP)).[¶](#section-6.7-5){.pilcrow}

NTLP is defined in \[[RFC5971](#RFC5971){.xref}\]. Two types of NSLPs
are defined: an NSLP for QoS signaling \[[RFC5974](#RFC5974){.xref}\]
and an NSLP for NATs/firewalls

The obstacles for deployment can be grouped into implementation-related
aspects and operational aspects.[¶](#section-6.7.1-1){.pilcrow}

-   ::: {#section-6.7.1-2.1}
    Implementation-related aspects:[¶](#section-6.7.1-2.1.1){.pilcrow}

    Although NSIS provides benefits with respect to flexibility,
    mobility, and security compared to other network signaling
    techniques, hardware vendors were reluctant to deploy this solution,
    because it would require additional implementation effort and would
    result in additional complexity for router
    implementations.[¶](#section-6.7.1-2.1.2){.pilcrow}

    NTLP mainly operates as a path-coupled signaling protocol, i.e., its
    messages are processed at the control plane of each intermediate
    node that is also forwarding the data flows. This requires a
    mechanism to intercept signaling packets while they are forwarded in
    the same manner (especially along the same path) as data packets.
    NSIS uses the IPv4 and IPv6 Router Alert Option (RAO) to allow for
    interception of those path-coupled signaling messages, and this
    technique requires router implementations to correctly understand
    and implement the handling of RAOs, e.g., to only process packets
    with RAOs of interest and to leave packets with irrelevant RAOs in
    the fast forwarding processing path (a comprehensive discussion of
    these issues can be found in \[[RFC6398](#RFC6398){.xref}\]). The
    latter was an issue with some router implementations at the time of
    standardization.[¶](#section-6.7.1-2.1.3){.pilcrow}

    Another reason is that path-coupled signaling protocols that
    interact with routers and request manipulation of state at these
    routers (or any other network element in general) are under
    scrutiny: a packet (or sequence of packets) out of the mainly
    untrusted data path is requesting creation and manipulation of
    network state. This is seen as potentially dangerous (e.g., opens up
    a DoS threat to a router\'s control plane) and difficult for an
    operator to control. Path-coupled signaling approaches were
    considered problematic (see also [Section
    3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6398#section-3){.relref} of
    \[[RFC6398](#RFC6398){.xref}\]). There are recommendations on how to

    NSIS not only required trust between customers and their provider,

    techniques would require some kind of dynamic SLA support that would
    imply (potentially quite complex) bilateral negotiations between
    different Internet Service Providers. This complexity was not
    considered to be justified, and increasing the bandwidth (and thus
    avoiding bottlenecks) was cheaper than actively managing network
    resource bottlenecks by using path-coupled QoS signaling techniques.
    Furthermore, an end-to-end path typically involves several provider

One goal of NSIS was to decrease the complexity of the signaling
protocol, but a path-coupled signaling protocol comes with the intrinsic
complexity of IP-based networks, beyond the complexity of the signaling
protocol itself. Sources of intrinsic complexity
include:[¶](#section-6.7.2-1){.pilcrow}

these end systems are usually not authenticated and heavy use of RAOs

    \[[RFC6437](#RFC6437){.xref}\][¶](#section-6.8-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.8-2.1}

IPv6 specifies a 20-bit Flow Label field \[[RFC6437](#RFC6437){.xref}\],
included in the fixed part of the IPv6 header and hence present in every
IPv6 packet. An endpoint sets the value in this field to one of a set of
pseudorandomly assigned values. If a packet is not part of any flow, the
flow label value is set to zero \[[RFC3697](#RFC3697){.xref}\]. A number
of Standards Track and Best Current Practice RFCs (e.g.,
\[[RFC8085](#RFC8085){.xref}\], \[[RFC6437](#RFC6437){.xref}\],
\[[RFC6438](#RFC6438){.xref}\]) encourage IPv6 endpoints to set a
non-zero value in this field. A multiplexing transport could choose to
use multiple flow labels to allow the network to either independently
forward its subflows or use one common value for the traffic aggregate.
The flow label is present in all fragments. IPsec was originally put
forward as one important use case for this mechanism and does encrypt
the field \[[RFC6438](#RFC6438){.xref}\].[¶](#section-6.8-3){.pilcrow}

Once set, the flow label can provide information that can help inform
network nodes about subflows present at the transport layer, without
needing to interpret the setting of upper-layer protocol fields
\[[RFC6294](#RFC6294){.xref}\]. This information can also be used to
coordinate how aggregates of transport subflows are grouped when queued
in the network and to select appropriate per-flow forwarding when
choosing between alternate paths \[[RFC6438](#RFC6438){.xref}\] (e.g.,

    Endpoint Implementation:[¶](#section-6.8.1-2.1.1){.pilcrow}

    For network nodes along a path to utilize the flow label, there
    needs to be a non-zero value inserted in the field
    \[[RFC6437](#RFC6437){.xref}\] at the sending endpoint. There needs
    to be an incentive for an endpoint to set an appropriate non-zero
    value. The value should appropriately reflect the level of
    aggregation the traffic expects to be provided by the network.
    However, this requires the stack to know granularity at which flows
    should be identified (or, conversely, which flows should receive
    aggregated treatment), i.e., which packets carry the same flow
    label. Therefore, setting a non-zero value may result in additional
    choices that need to be made by an application
    developer.[¶](#section-6.8.1-2.1.2){.pilcrow}

    Although the original flow label standard
    \[[RFC3697](#RFC3697){.xref}\] forbids any encoding of meaning into

The flow label is a general-purpose header field for use by the path.
Multiple uses have been proposed. One candidate use was to reduce the
complexity of forwarding decisions. However, modern routers can use a
\"fast path\", often taking advantage of hardware to accelerate
processing. The method can assist in more complex forwarding, such as
ECMP routing and load balancing.[¶](#section-6.8.2-1){.pilcrow}

Although \[[RFC6437](#RFC6437){.xref}\] recommended that endpoints
should by default choose uniformly distributed labels for their traffic,
the specification permitted an endpoint to choose to set a zero value.
This ability of endpoints to choose to set a flow label of zero has had
consequences on deployability:[¶](#section-6.8.2-2){.pilcrow}

-   [Before wide-scale support by endpoints, it would be impossible to
    rely on a non-zero flow label being set. Network nodes therefore
    would need to also employ other techniques to realize equivalent
    functions. An example of a method is one assuming semantics of the
    source port field to provide entropy input to a network-layer hash.
    This use of a 5-tuple to classify a packet represents a layering
    violation \[[RFC6294](#RFC6294){.xref}\]. When other methods have
    been deployed, they increase the cost of deploying standards-based

-   [Even though the flow label is specified as an end-to-end field,
    some network paths have been observed to not transparently forward
    the flow label. This could result from non-conformant equipment or
    could indicate that some operational networks have chosen to reuse
    the protocol field for other (e.g., internal) purposes. This results
    in lack of transparency, and a deployment hurdle to endpoints
    expecting that they can set a flow label that is utilized by the
    network. The more recent practice of \"greasing\"
    \[[GREASE](#I-D.iab-use-it-or-lose-it){.xref}\] would suggest that a
    different outcome could have been achieved if endpoints were always
    required to set a non-zero
    value.[¶](#section-6.8.2-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.8.2-3.2}
-   [\[[RFC1809](#RFC1809){.xref}\] noted that setting the choice of the
    flow label value can depend on the expectations of the traffic
    generated by an application, which suggests that an API should be
    presented to control the setting or policy that is used. However,
    many currently available APIs do not have this
    support.[¶](#section-6.8.2-3.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.8.2-3.3}

A growth in the use of encrypted transports (e.g., QUIC

those discussed above and could motivate renewed interest in utilizing
the flow label.[¶](#section-6.8.2-4){.pilcrow}

### [6.9.](#section-6.9){.section-number .selfRef} [Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN)](#name-explicit-congestion-notific){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-explicit-congestion-notific}

The suggested references for Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN)
are:[¶](#section-6.9-1){.pilcrow}

-   [\"[Recommendations on Queue Management and Congestion Avoidance in
    the Internet](#RFC2309){.xref}\"

    IP](#RFC3168){.xref}\"
    \[[RFC3168](#RFC3168){.xref}\][¶](#section-6.9-2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.9-2.3}
-   [\"Implementation Report on Experiences with Various TCP RFCs\"
    \[[vista-impl](#vista-impl){.xref}\], slides 6 and
    7[¶](#section-6.9-2.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.9-2.4}
-   [\"Implementation and Deployment of ECN\" (at
    \[[SallyFloyd](#SallyFloyd){.xref}\])[¶](#section-6.9-2.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.9-2.5}

In the early 1990s, the large majority of Internet traffic used TCP as
its transport protocol, but TCP had no way to detect path congestion
before the path was so congested that packets were being dropped. These
congestion events could affect all senders using a path, either by
\"lockout\", where long-lived flows monopolized the queues along a path,
or by \"full queues\", where queues remain full, or almost full, for a
long period of time.[¶](#section-6.9-3){.pilcrow}

In response to this situation, \"Active Queue Management\" (AQM) was
deployed in the network. A number of AQM disciplines have been deployed,
but one common approach was that routers dropped packets when a
threshold buffer length was reached, so that transport protocols like
TCP that were responsive to loss would detect this loss and reduce their
sending rates. Random Early Detection (RED) was one such proposal in the
IETF. As the name suggests, a router using RED as its AQM discipline
that detected time-averaged queue lengths passing a threshold would
choose incoming packets probabilistically to be dropped
\[[RFC2309](#RFC2309){.xref}\].[¶](#section-6.9-4){.pilcrow}

Researchers suggested providing \"explicit congestion notifications\" to
senders when routers along the path detected that their queues were
building, giving senders an opportunity to \"slow down\" as if a loss
had occurred, giving path queues time to drain, while the path still had
sufficient buffer capacity to accommodate bursty arrivals of packets
from other senders. This was proposed as an experiment in
\[[RFC2481](#RFC2481){.xref}\] and standardized in
\[[RFC3168](#RFC3168){.xref}\].[¶](#section-6.9-5){.pilcrow}

A key aspect of ECN was the use of IP header fields rather than IP
options to carry explicit congestion notifications, since the proponents
recognized that[¶](#section-6.9-6){.pilcrow}

Many routers process the \"regular\" headers in IP packets more
efficiently than they process the header information in IP
options.[¶](#section-6.9-7){.pilcrow}

Unlike most of the Path Aware technologies included in this document,
the story of ECN continues to the present day and encountered a large
number of Lessons Learned during that time. The early history of ECN
(non-)deployment provides Lessons Learned that were not captured by
other contributions in [Section 6](#Contributions){.xref}, so that is
the emphasis in this section of the
document.[¶](#section-6.9-8){.pilcrow}

::: {#reasons-for-non-deployment-8}
::: {#section-6.9.1 .section}
#### [6.9.1.](#section-6.9.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Reasons for Non-deployment](#name-reasons-for-non-deployment-9){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-reasons-for-non-deployment-9}

ECN deployment relied on three factors \-- support in client
implementations, support in router implementations, and deployment
decisions in operational networks.[¶](#section-6.9.1-1){.pilcrow}

The proponents of ECN did so much right, anticipating many of the
Lessons Learned now recognized in [Section 4](#LessonsLearned){.xref}.
They recognized the need to support incremental deployment ([Section
4.2](#EarlyAdopters){.xref}). They considered the impact on router
throughput ([Section 4.8](#Fast-paths){.xref}). They even considered
trust issues between end nodes and the network, for both non-compliant
end nodes ([Section 4.10](#IDsTrustingEndpoints){.xref}) and
non-compliant routers ([Section
4.9](#EndpointsTrustingIDs){.xref}).[¶](#section-6.9.1-2){.pilcrow}

They were rewarded with ECN being implemented in major operating
systems, for both end nodes and routers. A number of implementations are
listed under \"Implementation and Deployment of ECN\" at
\[[SallyFloyd](#SallyFloyd){.xref}\].[¶](#section-6.9.1-3){.pilcrow}

What they did not anticipate was routers that would crash when they saw
bits 6 and 7 in the IPv4 Type of Service (TOS) octet
\[[RFC0791](#RFC0791){.xref}\] / IPv6 Traffic Class field
\[[RFC2460](#RFC2460){.xref}\], which \[[RFC2481](#RFC2481){.xref}\]
redefined to be \"Currently Unused\", being set to a non-zero
value.[¶](#section-6.9.1-4){.pilcrow}

As described in \[[vista-impl](#vista-impl){.xref}\] (\"IGD\" stands for
\"Intermediate Gateway Device\"),[¶](#section-6.9.1-5){.pilcrow}

> IGD problem #1: one of the most popular versions from one of the most

> ECT(1) (indicating successful ECN capability negotiation) indicated,

> \[sic\][¶](#section-6.9.1-6){.pilcrow}

This implementation, which would be run on a significant percentage of
Internet end nodes, was shipped with ECN disabled, as was true for
several of the other implementations listed under \"Implementation and
Deployment of ECN\" at \[[SallyFloyd](#SallyFloyd){.xref}\]. Even if
subsequent router vendors fixed these implementations, ECN was still
disabled on end nodes, and given the trade-off between the benefits of
enabling ECN (somewhat better behavior during congestion) and the risks
of enabling ECN (possibly crashing a router somewhere along the path),
ECN tended to stay disabled on implementations that supported ECN for
decades afterwards.[¶](#section-6.9.1-7){.pilcrow}

Of the contributions included in [Section 6](#Contributions){.xref}, ECN
may be unique in providing these lessons:[¶](#section-6.9.2-1){.pilcrow}

-   [Even if you do everything right, you may trip over implementation
    bugs in devices you know nothing about, that will cause severe
    problems that prevent successful deployment of your Path Aware
    technology.[¶](#section-6.9.2-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.9.2-2.1}
-   [After implementations disable your Path Aware technology, it may
    take years, or even decades, to convince implementers to re-enable
    it by default.[¶](#section-6.9.2-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.9.2-2.2}

These two lessons, taken together, could be summarized as \"you get one
chance to get it right.\"[¶](#section-6.9.2-3){.pilcrow}

During discussion of ECN at \[[PANRG-110](#PANRG-110){.xref}\], we noted
that \"you get one chance to get it right\" isn\'t quite correct today,
because operating systems on so many host systems are frequently
updated, and transport protocols like QUIC
\[[RFC9000](#RFC9000){.xref}\] are being implemented in user space and
can be updated without touching installed operating systems. Neither of
these factors were true in the early
2000s.[¶](#section-6.9.2-4){.pilcrow}

We think that these restatements of the ECN Lessons Learned are more
useful for current implementers:[¶](#section-6.9.2-5){.pilcrow}

-   [Even if you do everything right, you may trip over implementation
    bugs in devices you know nothing about, that will cause severe
    problems that prevent successful deployment of your Path Aware
    technology. Testing before deployment isn\'t enough to ensure
    successful deployment. It is also necessary to \"deploy gently\",
    which often means deploying for a small subset of users to gain
    experience and implementing feedback mechanisms to detect that user
    experience is being
    degraded.[¶](#section-6.9.2-6.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.9.2-6.1}
-   [After implementations disable your Path Aware technology, it may
    take years, or even decades, to convince implementers to re-enable
    it by default. This might be based on the difficulty of distributing
    implementations that enable it by default, but it is just as likely
    to be based on the \"bad taste in the mouth\" that implementers have
    after an unsuccessful deployment attempt that degraded user
    experience.[¶](#section-6.9.2-6.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-6.9.2-6.2}

With these expansions, the two lessons, taken together, could be more
helpfully summarized as \"plan for failure\" \-- anticipate what your
next step will be, if initial deployment is
unsuccessful.[¶](#section-6.9.2-7){.pilcrow}

ECN deployment was also hindered by non-deployment of AQM in many
devices, because of operator interest in QoS features provided in the
network, rather than using the network to assist end systems in
providing for themselves. But that\'s another story, and the AQM Lessons
Learned are already covered in other contributions in [Section
6](#Contributions){.xref}.[¶](#section-6.9.2-8){.pilcrow}
