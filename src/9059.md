# Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) Extensions for Associated Bidirectional Label Switched Paths (LSPs) {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

This document defines Path Computation Element Communication Protocol
(PCEP) extensions for grouping two unidirectional MPLS-TE Label Switched
Paths (LSPs), one in each direction in the network, into an associated
bidirectional LSP. These PCEP extensions can be applied either using a
stateful PCE for both PCE-initiated and PCC-initiated LSPs or using a
stateless PCE. The PCEP procedures defined are applicable to the LSPs
using RSVP-TE for signaling.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC5440](#RFC5440){.xref}\] describes the Path Computation Element
Communication Protocol (PCEP) as a communication mechanism between a
Path Computation Client (PCC) and a Path Computation Element (PCE), or
between PCE and PCC, that enables computation of Multiprotocol Label
Switching (MPLS) - Traffic Engineering (TE) Label Switched Paths
(LSPs).[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC8231](#RFC8231){.xref}\] specifies extensions to PCEP to enable
stateful control of MPLS-TE LSPs. It describes two modes of operation:
passive stateful PCE and active stateful PCE. In
\[[RFC8231](#RFC8231){.xref}\], the focus is on active stateful PCE
where LSPs are provisioned on the PCC and control over them is delegated
to a PCE. Further, \[[RFC8281](#RFC8281){.xref}\] describes the setup,
maintenance, and teardown of PCE-initiated LSPs for the stateful PCE
model.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC8697](#RFC8697){.xref}\] introduces a generic mechanism for
creating a grouping of LSPs. This grouping can then be used to define
associations between sets of LSPs or between a set of LSPs and a set of
attributes, and it is equally applicable to the stateful PCE (active and
passive modes) and the stateless PCE.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) requirements document
\[[RFC5654](#RFC5654){.xref}\] specifies that \"MPLS-TP [MUST]{.bcp14}
support unidirectional, co-routed bidirectional, and associated
bidirectional point-to-point transport paths\".
\[[RFC7551](#RFC7551){.xref}\] defines RSVP signaling extensions for
binding forward and reverse unidirectional LSPs into an associated
bidirectional LSP. The fast reroute (FRR) procedures for associated
bidirectional LSPs are described in
\[[RFC8537](#RFC8537){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

This document defines PCEP extensions for grouping two unidirectional
MPLS-TE LSPs into an associated bidirectional LSP for both single-sided
and double-sided initiation cases either when using a stateful PCE for
both PCE-initiated and PCC-initiated LSPs or when using a stateless PCE.
The procedures defined are applicable to the LSPs using Resource
Reservation Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) for signaling
\[[RFC3209](#RFC3209){.xref}\]. Specifically, this document defines two
new Association Types, Single-Sided Bidirectional LSP Association and
Double-Sided Bidirectional LSP Association, as well as the Bidirectional
LSP Association Group TLV, to carry additional information for the
association.[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}

The procedure for associating two unidirectional Segment Routing (SR)
paths to form an associated bidirectional SR path is defined in
\[[BIDIR-PATH](#I-D.ietf-pce-sr-bidir-path){.xref}\] and is outside the
scope of this document.[¶](#section-1-6){.pilcrow}

As shown in [Figure
1](#ure-example-of-associated-bidirectional-lsp){.xref}, forward and
reverse unidirectional LSPs can be grouped to form an associated
bidirectional LSP. Node A is the ingress node for LSP1 and egress node
for LSP2, whereas node D is the ingress node for LSP2 and egress node
for LSP1. There are two methods of initiating the Bidirectional LSP
Association, single-sided and double-sided, as defined in
\[[RFC7551](#RFC7551){.xref}\] and described in the following
sections.[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

As specified in \[[RFC7551](#RFC7551){.xref}\], in the single-sided
case, the bidirectional tunnel is provisioned only on one endpoint node
(PCC) of the tunnel. Both endpoint nodes act as PCCs. Both forward and
reverse LSPs of this tunnel are initiated with the Association Type set
to \"Single-Sided Bidirectional LSP Association\" on the originating
endpoint node. The forward and reverse LSPs are identified in the
Bidirectional LSP Association Group TLV of their PCEP ASSOCIATION
objects.[¶](#section-3.1-1){.pilcrow}

The originating endpoint node signals the properties for the reverse LSP
in the RSVP REVERSE_LSP object \[[RFC7551](#RFC7551){.xref}\] of the
forward LSP Path message. The remote endpoint node then creates the
corresponding reverse tunnel and reverse LSP, and it then signals the
reverse LSP in response to the received RSVP-TE Path message. Similarly,
the remote endpoint node deletes the reverse LSP when it receives the
RSVP-TE message to delete the forward LSP
\[[RFC3209](#RFC3209){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3.1-2){.pilcrow}

As specified in \[[RFC8537](#RFC8537){.xref}\], for fast reroute bypass
tunnel assignment, the LSP starting from the originating endpoint node
is identified as the forward LSP of the single-sided initiated
bidirectional LSP.[¶](#section-3.1-3){.pilcrow}

The PCEP extensions defined in this document cover the following modes
of operation under the stateful PCE model:[¶](#section-3.4-1){.pilcrow}

-   [A PCC initiates the forward and reverse LSP of a single-sided
    bidirectional LSP and retains control of the LSPs. Similarly, both
    PCCs initiate the forward LSPs of a double-sided bidirectional LSP
    and retain control of the LSPs. The PCC computes the path itself or
    makes a request for path computation to a PCE. After the path setup,
    it reports the information and state of the path to the PCE. This
    includes the association group identifying the bidirectional LSP.
    This is the passive stateful mode defined in
    \[[RFC8051](#RFC8051){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3.4-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.4-2.1}

    PCE. Similarly, both PCCs initiate the forward LSPs of a
    double-sided bidirectional LSP and delegate control of the LSPs to a
    stateful PCE. During delegation, the association group identifying
    the bidirectional LSP is included. The PCE computes the path of the
    LSP and updates the PCC with the information about the path as long
    as it controls the LSP. This is the active stateful mode defined in

    Similarly, a PCE initiates the forward LSPs of a double-sided

The single-sided case has some advantages when compared to the

-   [Some Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) use cases
    may require an endpoint node to know both forward and reverse paths

As per \[[RFC8697](#RFC8697){.xref}\], LSPs are associated by adding
them to a common association group. This document defines two new
Association Types, called \"Single-Sided Bidirectional LSP Association\"
(4) and \"Double-Sided Bidirectional LSP Association\" (5), using the
generic ASSOCIATION object (Object-Class value 40). A member of the
Bidirectional LSP Association can take the role of a forward or reverse
LSP and follows the following rules:[¶](#section-4.1-1){.pilcrow}

-   [An LSP (forward or reverse) [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be part of more than
    one Bidirectional LSP
    Association.[¶](#section-4.1-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.1-2.1}
-   [The LSPs in a Bidirectional LSP Association [MUST]{.bcp14} have
    matching endpoint nodes in the reverse
    directions.[¶](#section-4.1-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.1-2.2}
-   [The same tunnel (as defined in [Section
    2.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3209#section-2.1){.relref} of
    \[[RFC3209](#RFC3209){.xref}\]) [MUST]{.bcp14} contain the forward
    and reverse LSPs of the Single-Sided Bidirectional LSP Association
    on the originating node, albeit both LSPs have reversed endpoint
    nodes.[¶](#section-4.1-2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.1-2.3}

The Bidirectional LSP Association Types are considered to be both
dynamic and operator configured in nature. As per
\[[RFC8697](#RFC8697){.xref}\], the association group could be manually
created by the operator on the PCEP peers, and the LSPs belonging to
this association are conveyed via PCEP messages to the PCEP peer;
alternately, the association group could be created dynamically by the
PCEP speaker, and both the association group information and the LSPs
belonging to the association group are conveyed to the PCEP peer. The
operator-configured Association Range [MUST]{.bcp14} be set for this
Association Type to mark a range of Association Identifiers that are
used for operator-configured associations to avoid any Association
Identifier clash within the scope of the Association Source (refer to
\[[RFC8697](#RFC8697){.xref}\]).[¶](#section-4.1-3){.pilcrow}

Specifically, for the PCE-initiated bidirectional LSPs, these
associations are dynamically created by the PCE on the PCE peers.
Similarly, for both the PCE-initiated and the PCC-initiated single-sided
cases, these associations are also dynamically created on the remote
endpoint node using the information received from the RSVP message from
the originating node.[¶](#section-4.1-4){.pilcrow}

The Association ID, Association Source, optional Global Association
Source TLV, and optional Extended Association ID TLV in the
Bidirectional LSP ASSOCIATION object are initialized using the
procedures defined in \[[RFC8697](#RFC8697){.xref}\] and
\[[RFC7551](#RFC7551){.xref}\].[¶](#section-4.1-5){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC8697](#RFC8697){.xref}\] specifies the mechanism for the
capability advertisement of the Association Types supported by a PCEP
speaker by defining an ASSOC-Type-List TLV to be carried within an OPEN
object. This capability exchange for the Bidirectional LSP Association
Types [MUST]{.bcp14} be done before using the Bidirectional LSP
Association. Thus, the PCEP speaker [MUST]{.bcp14} include the
Bidirectional LSP Association Types in the ASSOC-Type-List TLV and
[MUST]{.bcp14} receive the same from the PCEP peer before using the
Bidirectional LSP Association in PCEP

Flags for the Bidirectional LSP Association Group TLV are defined as
follows.[¶](#section-4.2-5){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

R (Reverse LSP, 1 bit, bit number 31):
:   Indicates whether the LSP associated is the reverse LSP of the
    bidirectional LSP. If this flag is set, the LSP is a reverse LSP. If
    this flag is not set, the LSP is a forward
    LSP.[¶](#section-4.2-6.2){.pilcrow}
:   

C (Co-routed Path, 1 bit, bit number 30):

set of configuration parameters or behaviors with the request
\[[RFC8697](#RFC8697){.xref}\]. A PCC can request co-routed or

As defined in \[[RFC5440](#RFC5440){.xref}\], the Bidirectional (B) flag
in the Request Parameters (RP) object is set when the PCC specifies that
the path computation request is for a bidirectional TE LSP with the same
TE requirements in each direction. For an associated bidirectional LSP,

Identifier (PLSP-ID) is created by a PCC to uniquely identify an LSP,
and it remains the same for the lifetime of a PCEP
session.[¶](#section-5.5-1){.pilcrow}

In the case of a Single-Sided Bidirectional LSP Association, the reverse
LSP of a bidirectional LSP created on the originating endpoint node is
identified by the PCE using two different PLSP-IDs, based on the PCEP
session on the ingress or egress node PCCs for the LSP. In other words,
the LSP will have a PLSP-ID P2 allocated at the ingress node PCC, while
it will have a PLSP-ID P3 allocated at the egress node PCC (as shown in
Figures
[2](#ure-example-of-pce-initiated-single-sided-bidirectional-lsp){.xref}
and

change in the PLSP-ID allocation procedure for the forward LSPs on
either PCC.[¶](#section-5.5-3){.pilcrow}

Error-Type = 26 (Association Error) and Error-value = 14 (Association
group mismatch).[¶](#section-5.7-2){.pilcrow}

The LSPs (forward or reverse) in a Single-Sided Bidirectional
Association [MUST]{.bcp14} belong to the same TE tunnel (as defined in
\[[RFC3209](#RFC3209){.xref}\]). If a PCE speaker attempts to add an LSP
in a Single-Sided Bidirectional LSP Association for a different tunnel,
the PCE speaker [MUST]{.bcp14} send PCErr with Error-Type = 26
(Association Error) and Error-value = 15 (Tunnel mismatch in the
association group).[¶](#section-5.7-3){.pilcrow}

The PCEP Path Setup Type (PST) for RSVP-TE is set to \"Path is set up
using the RSVP-TE signaling protocol\" (Value 0)
\[[RFC8408](#RFC8408){.xref}\]. If a PCEP speaker receives a different
PST value for the Bidirectional LSP Associations defined in this
document, the PCE speaker [MUST]{.bcp14} return a PCErr message with
Error-Type = 26 (Association Error) and Error-value = 16 (Path Setup
Type not supported).[¶](#section-5.7-4){.pilcrow}

A Bidirectional LSP Association cannot have both unidirectional LSPs
identified as reverse LSPs or both LSPs identified as forward LSPs. If a
PCE speaker receives an LSP not complying to this rule, the PCE speaker
[MUST]{.bcp14} send PCErr with Error-Type = 26 (Association Error) and
Error-value = 17 (Bidirectional LSP direction
mismatch).[¶](#section-5.7-5){.pilcrow}

A Bidirectional LSP Association cannot have one unidirectional LSP
identified as co-routed and the other identified as non-co-routed. If a
PCE speaker receives an LSP not complying to this rule, the PCE speaker
[MUST]{.bcp14} send PCErr with Error-Type = 26 (Association Error) and
Error-value = 18 (Bidirectional LSP co-routed
