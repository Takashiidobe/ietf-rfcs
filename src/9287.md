The version-independent definition of QUIC
\[[QUIC-INVARIANTS](#RFC8999){.xref}\] intentionally describes a very
narrow set of fields that are visible to entities other than endpoints.
Beyond those characteristics that are invariant, very little about the
\"wire image\" \[[RFC8546](#RFC8546){.xref}\] of QUIC is
visible.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

The second-most significant bit of the first byte in every QUIC packet
is defined as having a fixed value in QUIC version 1
\[[QUIC](#RFC9000){.xref}\]. The purpose of having a fixed value is to
allow endpoints to efficiently distinguish QUIC from other protocols;
see \[[DEMUX](#I-D.ietf-avtcore-rfc7983bis){.xref}\] for a description
of a system that might use this property. As this bit can identify a
packet as QUIC, it is sometimes referred to as the \"QUIC
Bit\".[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

Where endpoints and the intermediaries that support them do not depend
on the QUIC Bit having a fixed value, sending the same value in every
packet is more of a liability than an asset. If systems come to depend
on a fixed value, then it might become infeasible to define a version of
QUIC that attributes semantics to this bit.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

In order to safeguard future use of this bit, this document defines a
QUIC transport parameter that indicates that an endpoint is willing to
receive QUIC packets containing any value for this bit. By sending
different values for this bit, the hope is that the value will remain
available for future use

## [3.](#section-3){.section-number .selfRef} [The Grease QUIC Bit Transport Parameter](#name-the-grease-quic-bit-transpo){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-the-grease-quic-bit-transpo}

The grease_quic_bit transport parameter (0x2ab2) is defined for QUIC
version 1 \[[QUIC](#RFC9000){.xref}\]. This transport parameter can be
sent by both client and server. The transport parameter is sent with an
empty value; an endpoint that understands this transport parameter
[MUST]{.bcp14} treat receipt of a non-empty value of the transport
parameter as a connection error of type
TRANSPORT_PARAMETER_ERROR.[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

An endpoint that advertises the grease_quic_bit transport parameter
[MUST]{.bcp14} accept packets with the QUIC Bit set to a value of 0. The
QUIC Bit is defined as the second-most significant bit of the first byte
of QUIC packets (that is, the value 0x40).[¶](#section-3-2){.pilcrow}

### [3.1.](#section-3.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Clearing the QUIC Bit](#name-clearing-the-quic-bit){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-clearing-the-quic-bit}

Endpoints that receive the grease_quic_bit transport parameter from a
peer [SHOULD]{.bcp14} set the QUIC Bit to an unpredictable value unless
another extension assigns specific meaning to the value of the
bit.[¶](#section-3.1-1){.pilcrow}

Endpoints can set the QUIC Bit to 0 on all packets that are sent after
receiving and processing transport parameters. This could include
Initial, Handshake, and Retry packets.[¶](#section-3.1-2){.pilcrow}

A client [MAY]{.bcp14} also set the QUIC Bit to 0 in Initial, Handshake,
or 0-RTT packets that are sent prior to receiving transport parameters
from the server. However, a client [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} set the QUIC Bit
to 0 unless the Initial packets it sends include a token provided by the
server in a NEW_TOKEN frame ([Section
19.7](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9000#section-19.7){.relref} of
\[[QUIC](#RFC9000){.xref}\]), received less than 604800 seconds (7 days)
prior on a connection where the server also included the grease_quic_bit
transport parameter.[¶](#section-3.1-3){.pilcrow}

This 7-day limit allows for changes in server configuration. If server
configuration changes and a client does not set the QUIC Bit, then it is
possible that a server will drop packets, resulting in connection
failures.[¶](#section-3.1-4.1){.pilcrow}

A server [MUST]{.bcp14} set the QUIC Bit to 0 only after processing
transport parameters from a client. A server [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} remember
that a client negotiated the extension in a previous connection and set
the QUIC Bit to 0 based on that
information.[¶](#section-3.1-5){.pilcrow}

An endpoint [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} set the QUIC Bit to 0 without knowing
whether the peer supports the extension. As Stateless Reset packets
([Section
10.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9000#section-10.3){.relref} of
\[[QUIC](#RFC9000){.xref}\]) are only used after a loss of connection
state, endpoints are unlikely to be able to set the QUIC Bit to 0 on
Stateless Reset packets.[¶](#section-3.1-6){.pilcrow}

### [3.2.](#section-3.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Using the QUIC Bit](#name-using-the-quic-bit){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-using-the-quic-bit}

The purpose of this extension is to allow for the use of the QUIC Bit by
later extensions.[¶](#section-3.2-1){.pilcrow}

Extensions to QUIC that define semantics for the QUIC Bit can be
negotiated at the same time as the grease_quic_bit transport parameter.
In this case, a recipient needs to be able to distinguish a randomized
value from a value carrying information according to the extension.
Extensions that use the QUIC Bit [MUST]{.bcp14} negotiate their use
prior to acting on any semantic.[¶](#section-3.2-2){.pilcrow}

For example, an extension might define a transport parameter that is
sent in addition to the grease_quic_bit transport parameter. Though the
value of the QUIC Bit in packets received by a peer might be set
according to rules defined by the extension, they might also be
randomized as specified in this document.[¶](#section-3.2-3){.pilcrow}

The receipt of a transport parameter for an extension that uses the QUIC
Bit could be used to confirm that a peer supports the semantic defined
in the extension. To avoid acting on a randomized signal, the extension
can require that endpoints set the QUIC Bit according to the rules of
the extension but defer acting on the information conveyed until the
transport parameter for the extension is
received.[¶](#section-3.2-4){.pilcrow}

Extensions that define semantics for the QUIC Bit can be negotiated
without using the grease_quic_bit transport parameter. However,
including both extensions allows for the QUIC Bit to be greased even if
the alternative use is not supported.[¶](#section-3.2-5){.pilcrow}

This document introduces no new security considerations for endpoints or
entities that can rely on endpoint cooperation. However, this change
makes the task of identifying QUIC more difficult without cooperation of
endpoints. This sometimes works counter to the security goals of network
operators who rely on network classification to identify threats; see

3.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-quic-manageability-18#section-3.1){.relref}
