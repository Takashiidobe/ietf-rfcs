The Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME)
\[[RFC8555](#RFC8555){.xref}\] specification describes methods for
validating control of domain names via HTTP and DNS. Deployment
experience has shown it is also useful to be able to validate domain
control using the TLS layer alone. In particular, this allows hosting
providers, Content Distribution Networks (CDNs), and TLS-terminating
load balancers to validate domain control without modifying the HTTP
handling behavior of their backends.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

This document specifies a new TLS-based challenge type, tls-alpn-01.
This challenge requires negotiating a new application-layer protocol
using the TLS Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) Extension
\[[RFC7301](#RFC7301){.xref}\]. Because this protocol does not build on
a pre-existing deployment base, the ability to complete tls-alpn-01
challenges requires changes by service providers, making it explicitly
an opt-in process. Because service providers must proactively deploy new
code in order to implement tls-alpn-01, we can specify stronger controls
in that code, resulting in a stronger validation
method.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

The TLS with Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (TLS ALPN)
validation method proves control over a domain name by requiring the
ACME client to configure a TLS server to respond to specific connection
attempts using the ALPN extension with identifying information. The ACME
server validates control of the domain name by connecting to a TLS
server at one of the addresses resolved for the domain name and
verifying that a certificate with specific content is
presented.[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

The tls-alpn-01 ACME challenge object has the following
format:[¶](#section-3-2){.pilcrow}

type (required, string):
:   The string \"tls-alpn-01\"[¶](#section-3-3.2){.pilcrow}

token (required, string):
:   A random value that uniquely identifies the challenge. This value
    [MUST]{.bcp14} have at least 128 bits of entropy. It [MUST
    NOT]{.bcp14} contain any characters outside the base64url alphabet
    as described in [Section
    5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4648#section-5){.relref} of
    \[[RFC4648](#RFC4648){.xref}\]. Trailing \'=\' padding characters
    [MUST]{.bcp14} be stripped. See \[[RFC4086](#RFC4086){.xref}\] for
    additional information on randomness
    requirements.[¶](#section-3-3.4){.pilcrow}

The client prepares for validation by constructing a self-signed
certificate that [MUST]{.bcp14} contain an acmeIdentifier extension and
a subjectAlternativeName extension \[[RFC5280](#RFC5280){.xref}\]. The
subjectAlternativeName extension [MUST]{.bcp14} contain a single dNSName
entry where the value is the domain name being validated. The
acmeIdentifier extension [MUST]{.bcp14} contain the SHA-256 digest
\[[FIPS180-4](#FIPS180-4){.xref}\] of the key authorization
\[[RFC8555](#RFC8555){.xref}\] for the challenge. The acmeIdentifier
extension [MUST]{.bcp14} be critical so that the certificate isn\'t
inadvertently used by non-ACME software.[¶](#section-3-4){.pilcrow}

The acmeIdentifier extension is identified by the id-pe-acmeIdentifier
object identifier (OID) in the id-pe arc
\[[RFC5280](#RFC5280){.xref}\]:[¶](#section-3-5){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-3-6}
``` {.sourcecode .lang-asn.1}
id-pe-acmeIdentifier OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=  { id-pe 31 }
```

[¶](#section-3-6){.pilcrow}
:::

The extension has the following ASN.1 \[[X.680](#X.680){.xref}\] format
:[¶](#section-3-7){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-3-8}
``` {.sourcecode .lang-asn.1}
Authorization ::= OCTET STRING (SIZE (32))
```

[¶](#section-3-8){.pilcrow}
:::

The extnValue of the id-pe-acmeIdentifier extension is the ASN.1 DER
encoding \[[X.690](#X.690){.xref}\] of the Authorization structure,
which contains the SHA-256 digest of the key authorization for the
challenge.[¶](#section-3-9){.pilcrow}

Once this certificate has been created, it [MUST]{.bcp14} be provisioned
such that it is returned during a TLS handshake where the \"acme-tls/1\"
application-layer protocol has been negotiated and a Server Name
Indication (SNI) extension \[[RFC6066](#RFC6066){.xref}\] has been
provided containing the domain name being
validated.[¶](#section-3-10){.pilcrow}

A client responds by POSTing an empty JSON object ({}) to the challenge
URL to acknowledge that the challenge is ready to be validated by the
server. The base64url encoding of the protected headers and payload is
described in [Section
6.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8555#section-6.1){.relref} of
\[[RFC8555](#RFC8555){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3-11){.pilcrow}

On receiving this request from a client, the server constructs and
stores the key authorization from the challenge \"token\" value and the
current client account key.[¶](#section-3-13){.pilcrow}

The server then verifies the client\'s control over the domain by
verifying that the TLS server was configured as expected using the
following steps:[¶](#section-3-14){.pilcrow}

1.  [The ACME server computes the expected SHA-256 digest of the key
    authorization.[¶](#section-3-15.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-15.1}

2.  [The ACME server resolves the domain name being validated and
    chooses one of the IP addresses returned for validation (the server
    [MAY]{.bcp14} validate against multiple addresses if more than one
    is returned).[¶](#section-3-15.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-15.2}

3.  [The ACME server initiates a TLS connection to the chosen IP
    address. This connection [MUST]{.bcp14} use TCP port 443. The ACME
    server [MUST]{.bcp14} provide an ALPN extension with the single
    protocol name \"acme-tls/1\" and an SNI extension containing only
    the domain name being validated during the TLS
    handshake.[¶](#section-3-15.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-15.3}

4.  ::: {#section-3-15.4}
    The ACME server verifies that during the TLS handshake the
    application-layer protocol \"acme-tls/1\" was successfully
    negotiated (and that the ALPN extension contained only the value
    \"acme-tls/1\") and that the certificate returned
    contains:[¶](#section-3-15.4.1){.pilcrow}

    -   [a subjectAltName extension containing the dNSName being
        validated and no other
        entries[¶](#section-3-15.4.2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-15.4.2.1}
    -   [a critical acmeIdentifier extension containing the expected
        SHA-256 digest computed in step
        1[¶](#section-3-15.4.2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-15.4.2.2}
    :::

The comparison of dNSNames [MUST]{.bcp14} be case insensitive
\[[RFC4343](#RFC4343){.xref}\]. Note that as ACME doesn\'t support
Unicode identifiers, all dNSNames [MUST]{.bcp14} be encoded using the
rules of \[[RFC3492](#RFC3492){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3-16){.pilcrow}

If all of the above steps succeed, then the validation is successful.
Otherwise, it fails.[¶](#section-3-17){.pilcrow}

## [4.](#section-4){.section-number .selfRef} [acme-tls/1 Protocol Definition](#name-acme-tls-1-protocol-definit){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-acme-tls-1-protocol-definit}

The \"acme-tls/1\" protocol [MUST]{.bcp14} only be used for validating
ACME tls-alpn-01 challenges. The protocol consists of a TLS handshake in
which the required validation information is transmitted. The
\"acme-tls/1\" protocol does not carry application data. Once the
handshake is completed, the client [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} exchange any
further data with the server and [MUST]{.bcp14} immediately close the
connection. While this protocol uses X.509 certificates, it does not use
the authentication method described in \[[RFC5280](#RFC5280){.xref}\]
and, as such, does not require a valid signature on the provided
certificate nor require the TLS handshake to complete successfully. An
ACME server may wish to use an off-the-shelf TLS stack where it is not
simple to allow these divergences in the protocol as defined. Because of
this, an ACME server [MAY]{.bcp14} choose to withhold authorization if
either the certificate signature is invalid or the handshake doesn\'t
fully complete.[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

ACME servers that implement \"acme-tls/1\" [MUST]{.bcp14} only negotiate
TLS 1.2 \[[RFC5246](#RFC5246){.xref}\] or higher when connecting to
clients for validation.[¶](#section-4-2){.pilcrow}

## [5.](#section-5){.section-number .selfRef} [Security Considerations](#name-security-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-security-considerations}

The design of this challenge relies on some assumptions centered around
how an HTTPS server behaves during
validation.[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

The first assumption is that when an HTTPS server is being used to serve
content for multiple DNS names from a single IP address, it properly
segregates control of those names to the users that own them. This means
that if User A registers Host A and User B registers Host B, the HTTPS
server should not allow a TLS request using an SNI value for Host A to
be served by User B or a TLS connection with a server_name extension
identifying Host B to be answered by User A. If the HTTPS server allows
User B to serve this request, it allows them to illegitimately validate
control of Host A to the ACME server.[¶](#section-5-2){.pilcrow}

The second assumption is that a server will not violate
\[[RFC7301](#RFC7301){.xref}\] by blindly agreeing to use the
\"acme-tls/1\" protocol without actually understanding
it.[¶](#section-5-3){.pilcrow}

To further mitigate the risk of users claiming domain names used by
other users on the same infrastructure hosting providers, CDNs, and
other service providers [SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} allow users to provide
their own certificates for the TLS ALPN validation process. If providers
wish to implement TLS ALPN validation, they [SHOULD]{.bcp14} only
generate certificates used for validation themselves and not expose this
functionality to users.[¶](#section-5-4){.pilcrow}

The extensions to the ACME protocol described in this document build
upon the Security Considerations and threat model defined in [Section
10.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8555#section-10.1){.relref} of

## [Appendix A.](#section-appendix.a){.section-number .selfRef} [Design Rationale](#name-design-rationale){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-design-rationale}

The TLS ALPN challenge exists to iterate on the TLS SNI challenge
defined in the early ACME drafts. The TLS SNI challenge was convenient
for service providers who were either operating large TLS-layer load
balancing systems at which they wanted to perform validation or running
servers fronting large numbers of DNS names from a single host as it
allowed validation purely within the TLS layer. The value provided by
the TLS SNI challenge was considered large enough that this document was
written in order to provide a new challenge type that addressed the
existing security concerns.[¶](#section-appendix.a-1){.pilcrow}

A security issue in the TLS SNI challenge was discovered by Frans Rosen,
which allowed users of various service providers to illegitimately
validate control of the DNS names of other users of the provider. When
the TLS SNI challenge was designed, it was assumed that a user would
only be able to respond to TLS traffic via SNI for domain names they had
registered with a service provider (i.e., if a user registered
\'a.example\', they would only be able to respond to SNI requests for
\'a.example\' and not for SNI requests for \'b.example\'). It turns out
that a number of large service providers do not honor this property.
Because of this, users were able to respond to SNI requests for the
names used by the TLS SNI challenge validation process. This meant that
(1) if User A and User B had registered Host A and Host B, respectively,
User A would be able to claim the constructed SNI challenge name for
Host B, and (2) when the validation connection was made, User A would be
able to answer, thereby proving \'control\' of Host B. As the SNI name
used was a subdomain of the domain name being validated, rather than the
domain name itself, it was likely to not already be registered with the
service provider for traffic routing, making it much easier for a hijack
to occur.[¶](#section-appendix.a-2){.pilcrow}
