# RFC 8942 {#rfcnum}

# HTTP Client Hints {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

HTTP defines proactive content negotiation to allow servers to select
the appropriate response for a given request, based upon the user
agent\'s characteristics, as expressed in request headers. In practice,
user agents are often unwilling to send those request headers, because
it is not clear whether they will be used, and sending them impacts both
performance and privacy.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

This document defines an Accept-CH response header that servers can use
to advertise their use of request headers for proactive content
negotiation, along with a set of guidelines for the creation of such
headers, colloquially known as \"Client
Hints.\"[¶](#section-abstract-2){.pilcrow}

There are thousands of different devices accessing the web, each with
different device capabilities and preference information. These device
capabilities include hardware and software characteristics, as well as
dynamic user and user agent preferences. Historically, applications that
wanted the server to optimize content delivery and user experience based
on such capabilities had to rely on passive identification (e.g., by
matching the User-Agent header field ([Section
5.5.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7231#section-5.5.3){.relref} of
\[[RFC7231](#RFC7231){.xref}\]) against an established database of user
agent signatures), use HTTP cookies \[[RFC6265](#RFC6265){.xref}\] and
URL parameters, or use some combination of these and similar mechanisms
to enable ad hoc content negotiation.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

Such techniques are expensive to set up and maintain and are not
portable across both applications and servers. They also make it hard
for both user agent and server to understand which data are required and
are in use during the negotiation:[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

-   [User agent detection cannot reliably identify all static variables,
    cannot infer dynamic user agent preferences, requires an external
    device database, is not cache friendly, and is reliant on a passive
    fingerprinting
    surface.[¶](#section-1-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-3.1}
-   [Cookie-based approaches are not portable across applications and
    servers, impose additional client-side latency by requiring
    JavaScript execution, and are not cache
    friendly.[¶](#section-1-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-3.2}
-   [URL parameters, similar to cookie-based approaches, suffer from
    lack of portability and are hard to deploy due to a requirement to
    encode content negotiation data inside of the URL of each
    resource.[¶](#section-1-3.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-3.3}

Proactive content negotiation ([Section
3.4.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7231#section-3.4.1){.relref} of
\[[RFC7231](#RFC7231){.xref}\]) offers an alternative approach; user
agents use specified, well-defined request headers to advertise their
capabilities and characteristics, so that servers can select (or
formulate) an appropriate response based on those request headers (or on
other, implicit characteristics).[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

However, traditional proactive content negotiation techniques often mean
that user agents send these request headers prolifically. This causes
performance concerns (because it creates \"bloat\" in requests), as well
as privacy issues; passively providing such information allows servers
to silently fingerprint the user.[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}

This document defines Client Hints, a framework that enables servers to
opt-in to specific proactive content negotiation features, adapting
their content accordingly, as well as guidelines for content negotiation
mechanisms that use the framework. This document also defines a new
response header, Accept-CH, that allows an origin server to explicitly
ask that user agents send these headers in
requests.[¶](#section-1-6){.pilcrow}

Client Hints mitigate performance concerns by assuring that user agents
will only send the request headers when they\'re actually going to be
used, and they mitigate privacy concerns of passive fingerprinting by
requiring explicit opt-in and disclosure of required headers by the
server through the use of the Accept-CH response header, turning passive
fingerprinting vectors into active ones.[¶](#section-1-7){.pilcrow}

The document does not define specific usages of Client Hints. Such
usages need to be defined in their respective
specifications.[¶](#section-1-8){.pilcrow}

One example of such usage is the User-Agent Client Hints
\[[UA-CH](#UA-CH){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-9){.pilcrow}

## [2.](#section-2){.section-number .selfRef} [Client Hints Request Header Fields](#name-client-hints-request-header){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-client-hints-request-header}

A Client Hints request header field is an HTTP header field that is used
by HTTP user agents to indicate data that can be used by the server to
select an appropriate response. Each one conveys user-agent preferences
that the server can use to adapt and optimize the
response.[¶](#section-2-1){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-2.1 .section}
### [2.1.](#section-2.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Sending Client Hints](#name-sending-client-hints){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-sending-client-hints}

User agents choose what Client Hints to send in a request based on their
default settings, user configuration, and server preferences expressed
in `Accept-CH`. The user agent and server can use an opt-in mechanism
outlined below to negotiate which header fields need to be sent to allow
for efficient content adaption, and they can optionally use additional
mechanisms (e.g., as outlined in
\[[CLIENT-HINTS-INFRASTRUCTURE](#CLIENT-HINTS-INFRASTRUCTURE){.xref}\])
to negotiate delegation policies that control access of third parties to
those same header fields. User agents [SHOULD]{.bcp14} require an opt-in
to send any hints that are not considered low-entropy. See the
low-entropy hint table at
\[[CLIENT-HINTS-INFRASTRUCTURE](#CLIENT-HINTS-INFRASTRUCTURE){.xref}\]
for examples of hints that expose low amounts of
entropy.[¶](#section-2.1-1){.pilcrow}

Implementers need to be aware of the fingerprinting implications when
implementing support for Client Hints and follow the considerations
outlined in the Security Considerations section of this document (see
[Section
4](#security-considerations){.xref}).[¶](#section-2.1-2){.pilcrow}

When presented with a request that contains one or more Client Hints
header fields, servers can optimize the response based upon the
information in them. When doing so, and if the resource is cacheable,
the server [MUST]{.bcp14} also generate a Vary response header field
([Section
7.1.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7231#section-7.1.4){.relref} of
\[[RFC7231](#RFC7231){.xref}\]) to indicate which hints can affect the
selected response and whether the selected response is appropriate for a
later request.[¶](#section-2.2-1){.pilcrow}

Servers [MUST]{.bcp14} ignore hints they do not understand nor support.
There is no mechanism for servers to indicate to user agents that hints
were ignored.[¶](#section-2.2-2){.pilcrow}

Furthermore, the server can generate additional response header fields
(as specified by the hint or hints in use) that convey related values to
aid client processing.[¶](#section-2.2-3){.pilcrow}

The Accept-CH response header field indicates server support for the
hints indicated in its value. Servers wishing to receive user agent
information through Client Hints [SHOULD]{.bcp14} add the Accept-CH
response header to their responses as early as
possible.[¶](#section-3.1-1){.pilcrow}

Accept-CH is a Structured Header \[[RFC8941](#RFC8941){.xref}\]. Its
value [MUST]{.bcp14} be an sf-list ([Section
3.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8941#section-3.1){.relref} of
\[[RFC8941](#RFC8941){.xref}\]) whose members are Tokens ([Section
3.3.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8941#section-3.3.4){.relref} of
\[[RFC8941](#RFC8941){.xref}\]). Its ABNF
is:[¶](#section-3.1-2){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-3.1-3}
``` {.sourcecode .lang-abnf}
  Accept-CH = sf-list
```

For example:[¶](#section-3.1-4){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-3.1-5}
``` {.sourcecode .lang-http-message}
Accept-CH: Sec-CH-Example, Sec-CH-Example-2
```

[¶](#section-3.1-5){.pilcrow}
:::

When a user agent receives an HTTP response containing `Accept-CH`, it
indicates that the origin opts-in to receive the indicated request
header fields for subsequent same-origin requests. The opt-in
[MUST]{.bcp14} be ignored if delivered over non-secure transport (using
a scheme different from HTTPS). It [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be persisted and
bound to the origin to enable delivery of Client Hints on subsequent
requests to the server\'s origin, for the duration of the user\'s
session (as defined by the user agent). An opt-in overrides previous
persisted opt-in values and [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be persisted in its
stead.[¶](#section-3.1-6){.pilcrow}

Based on the Accept-CH example above, which is received in response to a
user agent navigating to \"https://site.example\", and delivered over a
secure transport, persisted Accept-CH preferences will be bound to
\"https://site.example\". It will then use it for navigations to for
example, \"https://site.example/foobar.html\", but not to, for example,
\"https://foobar.site.example/\". It will similarly use the preference
for any same-origin resource requests (e.g., to
\"https://site.example/image.jpg\") initiated by the page constructed
from the navigation\'s response, but not to cross-origin resource
requests (e.g., \"https://thirdparty.example/resource.js\"). This
preference will not extend to resource requests initiated to
\"https://site.example\" from other origins (e.g., from navigations to
\"https://other.example/\").[¶](#section-3.1-7){.pilcrow}

### [4.1.](#section-4.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Information Exposure](#name-information-exposure){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-information-exposure}

Request header fields used in features relying on this document expose
information about the user\'s environment to enable privacy-preserving
proactive content negotiation and avoid exposing passive fingerprinting
vectors. However, implementers need to bear in mind that in the worst
case, uncontrolled and unmonitored active fingerprinting is not better
than passive fingerprinting. In order to provide user privacy benefits,
user agents need to apply further policies that prevent abuse of the
information exposed by features using Client
Hints.[¶](#section-4.1-1){.pilcrow}

The information exposed by features might reveal new information about
the user, and implementers ought to consider the following
considerations, recommendations, and best
practices.[¶](#section-4.1-2){.pilcrow}

The underlying assumption is that exposing information about the user as
a request header is equivalent (from a security perspective) to exposing
this information by other means. (For example, if the request\'s origin
can access that information using JavaScript APIs and transmit it to its
servers.)[¶](#section-4.1-3){.pilcrow}

Because Client Hints is an explicit opt-in mechanism, it means that
servers wanting access to information about the user\'s environment need
to actively ask for it, enabling clients and privacy researchers to keep
track of which origins collect that data, and potentially act upon it.
The header-based opt-in means that removal of passive fingerprinting
vectors is possible. As an example, the user agent can reduce the
information exposed by the User-Agent string, while enabling active
access to that information through User-Agent Client Hints
\[[UA-CH](#UA-CH){.xref}\]. Otherwise, the user agent can expose
information already available through script (e.g., the Save-Data Client
Hints
\<<https://wicg.github.io/savedata/#save-data-request-header-field>\>),
without increasing the passive fingerprinting surface. User agents
supporting Client Hints features which send certain information to
opted-in servers [SHOULD]{.bcp14} avoid sending the equivalent
information passively.[¶](#section-4.1-4){.pilcrow}

Therefore, features relying on this document to define Client Hint
headers [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} provide new information that is otherwise not
made available to the application by the user agent, such as existing
request headers, HTML, CSS, or JavaScript.[¶](#section-4.1-5){.pilcrow}

Such features need to take into account the following aspects of the
exposed information:[¶](#section-4.1-6){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

Entropy:
:   Exposing highly granular data can be used to help identify users
    across multiple requests to different origins. Reducing the set of
    header field values that can be expressed, or restricting them to an
    enumerated range where the advertised value is close to but is not
    an exact representation of the current value, can improve privacy
    and reduce risk of linkability by ensuring that the same value is
    sent by multiple users.[¶](#section-4.1-7.2){.pilcrow}
:   

Sensitivity:
:   The feature [SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} expose user-sensitive information.
    To that end, information available to the application, but gated
    behind specific user actions (e.g., a permission prompt or user
    activation), [SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} be exposed as a Client
    Hint.[¶](#section-4.1-7.4){.pilcrow}
:   

Change over time:
:   The feature [SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} expose user information that
    changes over time, unless the state change itself is also exposed
    (e.g., through JavaScript callbacks).[¶](#section-4.1-7.6){.pilcrow}
:   

Different features will be positioned in different points in the space
between low-entropy, non-sensitive, and static information (e.g., user
agent information) and high-entropy, sensitive, and dynamic information
(e.g., geolocation). User agents need to consider the value provided by
a particular feature vs. these considerations and may wish to have
different policies regarding that tradeoff on a per-feature or other
fine-grained basis.[¶](#section-4.1-8){.pilcrow}

Implementers ought to consider both user- and server-controlled
mechanisms and policies to control which Client Hints header fields are
advertised:[¶](#section-4.1-9){.pilcrow}

-   [Implementers [SHOULD]{.bcp14} restrict delivery of some or all
    Client Hints header fields to the opt-in origin only, unless the
    opt-in origin has explicitly delegated permission to another origin
    to request Client Hints header
    fields.[¶](#section-4.1-10.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.1-10.1}
-   [Implementers that consider providing user-choice mechanisms that
    allow users to balance privacy concerns against bandwidth
    limitations need to also consider that explaining the privacy
    implications involved to users, such as the risks of passive
    fingerprinting, may be challenging or even
    impractical.[¶](#section-4.1-10.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.1-10.2}
-   [Implementations specific to certain use cases or threat models
    [MAY]{.bcp14} avoid transmitting some or all of the Client Hints

### [4.2.](#section-4.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Deployment and Security Risks](#name-deployment-and-security-ris){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-deployment-and-security-ris}

Deployment of new request headers requires several
considerations:[¶](#section-4.2-1){.pilcrow}

-   [Potential conflicts due to existing use of a header field
    name[¶](#section-4.2-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.2-2.1}
-   [Properties of the data communicated in a header field
    value[¶](#section-4.2-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-4.2-2.2}

Authors of new Client Hints are advised to carefully consider whether
they need to be able to be added by client-side content (e.g., scripts)
or whether the Client Hints need to be exclusively set by the user
agent. In the latter case, the Sec- prefix on the header field name has
the effect of preventing scripts and other application content from
setting them in user agents. Using the \"Sec-\" prefix signals to
servers that the user agent \-- and not application content \--
generated the values. See \[[FETCH](#FETCH){.xref}\] for more
information.[¶](#section-4.2-3){.pilcrow}

By convention, request headers that are Client Hints are encouraged to
use a CH- prefix, to make them easier to identify as using this
framework; for example, CH-Foo or, with a \"Sec-\" prefix, Sec-CH-Foo.
Doing so makes them easier to identify programmatically (e.g., for
stripping unrecognized hints from requests by privacy
filters).[¶](#section-4.2-4){.pilcrow}

A Client Hints request header negotiated using the Accept-CH opt-in
mechanism [MUST]{.bcp14} have a field name that matches sf-token
([Section
3.3.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8941#section-3.3.4){.relref} of
\[[RFC8941](#RFC8941){.xref}\]).[¶](#section-4.2-5){.pilcrow}

### [4.3.](#section-4.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Abuse Detection](#name-abuse-detection){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-abuse-detection}

A user agent that tracks access to active fingerprinting information
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} consider emission of Client Hints headers similar to
the way it would consider access to the equivalent
API.[¶](#section-4.3-1){.pilcrow}

Research into abuse of Client Hints might look at how HTTP responses to
requests that contain Client Hints differ from those with different
values and from those without values. This might be used to reveal which
Client Hints are in use, allowing researchers to further analyze that
use.[¶](#section-4.3-2){.pilcrow}

## [5.](#section-5){.section-number .selfRef} [Cost of Sending Hints](#name-cost-of-sending-hints){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-cost-of-sending-hints}

Sending Client Hints to the server incurs an increase in request byte
size. Some of this increase can be mitigated by HTTP header compression
schemes, but each new hint sent will still lead to some increased
bandwidth usage. Servers [SHOULD]{.bcp14} take that into account when
opting in to receive Client Hints and [SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} opt-in to
receive hints unless they are to be used for content adaptation
purposes.[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

Due to request byte size increase, features relying on this document to
define Client Hints [MAY]{.bcp14} consider restricting sending those
hints to certain request destinations \[[FETCH](#FETCH){.xref}\], where
they are more likely to be useful.[¶](#section-5-2){.pilcrow}
