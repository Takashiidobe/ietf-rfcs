# RFC 9065 {#rfcnum}

# Considerations around Transport Header Confidentiality, Network Operations, and the Evolution of Internet Transport Protocols {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

To protect user data and privacy, Internet transport protocols have
supported payload encryption and authentication for some time. Such
encryption and authentication are now also starting to be applied to the
transport protocol headers. This helps avoid transport protocol
ossification by middleboxes, mitigate attacks against the transport
protocol, and protect metadata about the communication. Current
operational practice in some networks inspect transport header
information within the network, but this is no longer possible when
those transport headers are encrypted.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

This document discusses the possible impact when network traffic uses a
protocol with an encrypted transport header. It suggests issues to
consider when designing new transport protocols or
features.[¶](#section-abstract-2){.pilcrow}

## [1.](#section-1){.section-number .selfRef} [Introduction](#name-introduction){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-introduction}

The transport layer supports the end-to-end flow of data across a
network path, providing features such as connection establishment,
reliability, framing, ordering, congestion control, flow control, etc.,
as needed to support applications. One of the core functions of an
Internet transport is to discover and adapt to the characteristics of
the network path that is currently being
used.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

For some years, it has been common for the transport-layer payload to be
protected by encryption and authentication but for the transport-layer
headers to be sent unprotected. Examples of protocols that behave in
this manner include Transport Layer Security (TLS) over TCP
\[[RFC8446](#RFC8446){.xref}\], Datagram TLS
\[[RFC6347](#RFC6347){.xref}\] \[[DTLS](#I-D.ietf-tls-dtls13){.xref}\],
the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol \[[RFC3711](#RFC3711){.xref}\],
and tcpcrypt \[[RFC8548](#RFC8548){.xref}\]. The use of unencrypted
transport headers has led some network operators, researchers, and
others to develop tools and processes that rely on observations of
transport headers both in aggregate and at the flow level to infer
details of the network\'s behaviour and inform operational
practice.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

Transport protocols are now being developed that encrypt some or all of
the transport headers, in addition to the transport payload data. The
QUIC transport protocol \[[RFC9000](#RFC9000){.xref}\] is an example of
such a protocol. Such transport header encryption makes it difficult to
observe transport protocol behaviour from the vantage point of the
network. This document discusses some implications of transport header
encryption for network operators and researchers that have previously
observed transport headers, and it highlights some issues to consider
for transport protocol designers.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

As discussed in \[[RFC7258](#RFC7258){.xref}\], the IETF has concluded
that Pervasive Monitoring (PM) is a technical attack that needs to be
mitigated in the design of IETF protocols. This document supports that
conclusion. It also recognises that \[[RFC7258](#RFC7258){.xref}\]
states, \"Making networks unmanageable to mitigate PM is not an
acceptable outcome, but ignoring PM would go against the consensus
documented here. An appropriate balance will emerge over time as real
instances of this tension are considered.\" This document is written to
provide input to the discussion around what is an appropriate balance by
highlighting some implications of transport header
encryption.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

Current uses of transport header information by network devices on the
Internet path are explained. These uses can be beneficial or malicious.
This is written to provide input to the discussion around what is an
appropriate balance by highlighting some implications of transport
header encryption.[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}

## [2.](#section-2){.section-number .selfRef} [Current Uses of Transport Headers within the Network](#name-current-uses-of-transport-h){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-current-uses-of-transport-h}

In response to pervasive surveillance \[[RFC7624](#RFC7624){.xref}\]
revelations and the IETF consensus that \"Pervasive Monitoring Is an
Attack\" \[[RFC7258](#RFC7258){.xref}\], efforts are underway to
increase encryption of Internet traffic. Applying confidentiality to
transport header fields can improve privacy and can help to mitigate
certain attacks or manipulation of packets by devices on the network
path, but it can also affect network operations and measurement
\[[RFC8404](#RFC8404){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2-1){.pilcrow}

When considering what parts of the transport headers should be encrypted
to provide confidentiality and what parts should be visible to network
devices (including unencrypted but authenticated headers), it is
necessary to consider both the impact on network operations and
management and the implications for ossification and user privacy
\[[Measurement](#Measurement){.xref}\]. Different parties will view the
relative importance of these concerns differently. For some, the
benefits of encrypting all the transport headers outweigh the impact of
doing so; others might analyse the security, privacy, and ossification
impacts and arrive at a different trade-off.[¶](#section-2-2){.pilcrow}

This section reviews examples of the observation of transport-layer
headers within the network by using devices on the network path or by
using information exported by an on-path device. Unencrypted transport
headers provide information that can support network operations and
management, and this section notes some ways in which this has been
done. Unencrypted transport header information also contributes metadata
that can be exploited for purposes unrelated to network transport
measurement, diagnostics, or troubleshooting (e.g., to block or to
throttle traffic from a specific content provider), and this section
also notes some threats relating to unencrypted transport
headers.[¶](#section-2-3){.pilcrow}

Exposed transport information also provides a source of information that
contributes to linked data sets, which could be exploited to deduce
private information, e.g., user patterns, user location, tracking
behaviour, etc. This might reveal information the parties did not intend
to be revealed. \[[RFC6973](#RFC6973){.xref}\] aims to make designers,
implementers, and users of Internet protocols aware of privacy-related
design choices in IETF protocols.[¶](#section-2-4){.pilcrow}

This section does not consider intentional modification of transport
headers by middleboxes, such as devices performing Network Address
Translation (NAT) or firewalls.[¶](#section-2-5){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-2.1 .section}
### [2.1.](#section-2.1){.section-number .selfRef} [To Separate Flows in Network Devices](#name-to-separate-flows-in-networ){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-to-separate-flows-in-networ}

Some network-layer mechanisms separate network traffic by flow without
resorting to identifying the type of traffic: hash-based load sharing
across paths (e.g., Equal-Cost Multipath (ECMP)); sharing across a group
of links (e.g., using a Link Aggregation Group (LAG)); ensuring equal
access to link capacity (e.g., Fair Queuing (FQ)); or distributing
traffic to servers (e.g., load balancing). To prevent packet reordering,
forwarding engines can consistently forward the same transport flows
along the same forwarding path, often achieved by calculating a hash
using an n-tuple gleaned from a combination of link header information
through to transport header information. This n-tuple can use the Media
Access Control (MAC) address and IP addresses and can include observable
transport header information.[¶](#section-2.1-1){.pilcrow}

When transport header information cannot be observed, there can be less
information to separate flows at equipment along the path. Flow
separation might not be possible when a transport forms traffic into an
encrypted aggregate. For IPv6, the Flow Label
\[[RFC6437](#RFC6437){.xref}\] can be used even when all transport
information is encrypted, enabling Flow Label-based ECMP
\[[RFC6438](#RFC6438){.xref}\] and load sharing
\[[RFC7098](#RFC7098){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2.1-2){.pilcrow}

### [2.2.](#section-2.2){.section-number .selfRef} [To Identify Transport Protocols and Flows](#name-to-identify-transport-proto){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-to-identify-transport-proto}

Information in exposed transport-layer headers can be used by the
network to identify transport protocols and flows
\[[RFC8558](#RFC8558){.xref}\]. The ability to identify transport
protocols, flows, and sessions is a common function performed, for
example, by measurement activities, Quality of Service (QoS)
classifiers, and firewalls. These functions can be beneficial and
performed with the consent of, and in support of, the end user.
Alternatively, the same mechanisms could be used to support practises
that might be adversarial to the end user, including blocking,
deprioritising, and monitoring traffic without
consent.[¶](#section-2.2-1){.pilcrow}

Observable transport header information, together with information in
the network header, has been used to identify flows and their connection
state, together with the set of protocol options being used. Transport
protocols, such as TCP \[[RFC7414](#RFC7414){.xref}\] and the Stream
Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) \[[RFC4960](#RFC4960){.xref}\],
specify a standard base header that includes sequence number information
and other data. They also have the possibility to negotiate additional
headers at connection setup, identified by an option number in the
transport header.[¶](#section-2.2-2){.pilcrow}

In some uses, an assigned transport port (e.g., 0..49151) can identify
the upper-layer protocol or service \[[RFC7605](#RFC7605){.xref}\].
However, port information alone is not sufficient to guarantee
identification. Applications can use arbitrary ports and do not need to
use assigned port numbers. The use of an assigned port number is also
not limited to the protocol for which the port is intended. Multiple
sessions can also be multiplexed on a single port, and ports can be
reused by subsequent sessions.[¶](#section-2.2-3){.pilcrow}

Some flows can be identified by observing signalling data (e.g., see
\[[RFC3261](#RFC3261){.xref}\] and \[[RFC8837](#RFC8837){.xref}\]) or
through the use of magic numbers placed in the first byte(s) of a
datagram payload
\[[RFC7983](#RFC7983){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2.2-4){.pilcrow}

When transport header information cannot be observed, this removes
information that could have been used to classify flows by passive
observers along the path. More ambitious ways could be used to collect,
estimate, or infer flow information, including heuristics based on the
analysis of traffic patterns, such as classification of flows relying on
timing, volumes of information, and correlation between multiple flows.
For example, an operator that cannot access the Session Description
Protocol (SDP) session descriptions \[[RFC8866](#RFC8866){.xref}\] to
classify a flow as audio traffic might instead use (possibly
less-reliable) heuristics to infer that short UDP packets with regular
spacing carry audio traffic. Operational practises aimed at inferring
transport parameters are out of scope for this document, and are only
mentioned here to recognise that encryption does not prevent operators
from attempting to apply practises that were used with unencrypted
transport headers.[¶](#section-2.2-5){.pilcrow}

The IAB \[[RFC8546](#RFC8546){.xref}\] has provided a summary of
expected implications of increased encryption on network functions that
use the observable headers and describe the expected benefits of designs
that explicitly declare protocol-invariant header information that can
be used for this purpose.[¶](#section-2.2-6){.pilcrow}

headers to understand transport protocol performance and
behaviour.[¶](#section-2.3-1){.pilcrow}

Observable transport headers enable explicit measurement and analysis of
protocol performance and detection of network anomalies at any point
along the Internet path. Some operators use passive monitoring to manage
their portion of the Internet by characterising the performance of
link/network segments. Inferences from transport headers are used to
derive performance metrics:[¶](#section-2.3.1-1){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

Traffic Rate and Volume:

:   Per-application traffic rate and volume measures can be used to
    characterise the traffic that uses a network segment or the pattern
    of network usage. Observing the protocol sequence number and packet
    size offers one way to measure this (e.g., measurements observing
    counters in periodic reports, such as RTCP
    \[[RFC3550](#RFC3550){.xref}\] \[[RFC3711](#RFC3711){.xref}\]
    \[[RFC4585](#RFC4585){.xref}\], or measurements observing protocol
    sequence numbers in statistical samples of packet flows or specific
    control packets, such as those observed at the start and end of a
    flow).[¶](#section-2.3.1-2.2.1){.pilcrow}

    Measurements can be per endpoint or for an endpoint aggregate. These
    could be used to assess usage or for subscriber
    billing.[¶](#section-2.3.1-2.2.2){.pilcrow}

    Such measurements can be used to trigger traffic shaping and to
    associate QoS support within the network and lower layers. This can
    be done with consent and in support of an end user to improve
    quality of service or could be used by the network to deprioritise
    certain flows without user
    consent.[¶](#section-2.3.1-2.2.3){.pilcrow}

    The traffic rate and volume can be determined, providing that the
    packets belonging to individual flows can be identified, but there
    might be no additional information about a flow when the transport
    headers cannot be observed.[¶](#section-2.3.1-2.2.4){.pilcrow}

:   

Loss Rate and Loss Pattern:

:   Flow loss rate can be derived (e.g., from transport sequence numbers
    or inferred from observing transport protocol interactions) and has
    been used as a metric for performance assessment and to characterise
    transport behaviour. Network operators have used the variation in
    patterns to detect changes in the offered service. Understanding the
    location and root cause of loss can help an operator determine
    whether this requires corrective
    action.[¶](#section-2.3.1-2.4.1){.pilcrow}

    There are various causes of loss, including: corruption of link
    frames (e.g., due to interference on a radio link); buffering loss
    (e.g., overflow due to congestion, Active Queue Management (AQM)
    \[[RFC7567](#RFC7567){.xref}\], or inadequate provision following
    traffic preemption), and policing (e.g., traffic management
    \[[RFC2475](#RFC2475){.xref}\]). Understanding flow loss rates
    requires maintaining the per-flow state (flow identification often
    requires transport-layer information) and either observing the
    increase in sequence numbers in the network or transport headers or
    comparing a per-flow packet counter with the number of packets that
    the flow actually sent. Per-hop loss can also sometimes be monitored
    at the interface level by devices on the network path or by using
    in-situ methods operating over a network segment (see [Section
    3.3](#other-sources){.xref}).[¶](#section-2.3.1-2.4.2){.pilcrow}

    The pattern of loss can provide insight into the cause of loss.
    Losses can often occur as bursts, randomly timed events, etc. It can
    also be valuable to understand the conditions under which loss
    occurs. This usually requires relating loss to the traffic flowing
    at a network node or segment at the time of loss. Transport header
    information can help identify cases where loss could have been
    wrongly identified or where the transport did not require
    retransmission of a lost packet.[¶](#section-2.3.1-2.4.3){.pilcrow}

:   

Throughput and Goodput:
:   Throughput is the amount of payload data sent by a flow per time
    interval. Goodput (the subset of throughput consisting of useful
    traffic; see [Section
    2.5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7928#section-2.5){.relref} of
    \[[RFC7928](#RFC7928){.xref}\] and \[[RFC5166](#RFC5166){.xref}\])
    is a measure of useful data exchanged. The throughput of a flow can
    be determined in the absence of transport header information,
    providing that the individual flow can be identified, and the
    overhead known. Goodput requires the ability to differentiate loss
    and retransmission of packets, for example, by observing packet
    sequence numbers in the TCP or RTP headers
    \[[RFC3550](#RFC3550){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2.3.1-2.6){.pilcrow}
:   

Latency:

:   Latency is a key performance metric that impacts application and
    user-perceived response times. It often indirectly impacts
    throughput and flow completion time. This determines the reaction
    time of the transport protocol itself, impacting flow setup,
    congestion control, loss recovery, and other transport mechanisms.
    The observed latency can have many components
    \[[Latency](#Latency){.xref}\]. Of these, unnecessary/unwanted
    queueing in buffers of the network devices on the path has often
    been observed as a significant factor
    \[[bufferbloat](#bufferbloat){.xref}\]. Once the cause of unwanted
    latency has been identified, this can often be
    eliminated.[¶](#section-2.3.1-2.8.1){.pilcrow}

    To measure latency across a part of a path, an observation point
    \[[RFC7799](#RFC7799){.xref}\] can measure the experienced
    round-trip time (RTT) by using packet sequence numbers and
    acknowledgements or by observing header timestamp information. Such
    information allows an observation point on the network path to
    determine not only the path RTT but also allows measurement of the
    upstream and downstream contribution to the RTT. This could be used
    to locate a source of latency, e.g., by observing cases where the
    median RTT is much greater than the minimum RTT for a part of a
    path.[¶](#section-2.3.1-2.8.2){.pilcrow}

    The service offered by network operators can benefit from latency
    information to understand the impact of configuration changes and to
    tune deployed services. Latency metrics are key to evaluating and
    deploying AQM \[[RFC7567](#RFC7567){.xref}\], Diffserv
    \[[RFC2474](#RFC2474){.xref}\], and Explicit Congestion Notification
    (ECN) \[[RFC3168](#RFC3168){.xref}\] \[[RFC8087](#RFC8087){.xref}\].
    Measurements could identify excessively large buffers, indicating
    where to deploy or configure AQM. An AQM method is often deployed in
    combination with other techniques, such as scheduling
    \[[RFC7567](#RFC7567){.xref}\] \[[RFC8290](#RFC8290){.xref}\], and
    although parameter-less methods are desired
    \[[RFC7567](#RFC7567){.xref}\], current methods often require tuning
    \[[RFC8290](#RFC8290){.xref}\] \[[RFC8289](#RFC8289){.xref}\]
    \[[RFC8033](#RFC8033){.xref}\] because they cannot scale across all
    possible deployment scenarios.[¶](#section-2.3.1-2.8.3){.pilcrow}

    Latency and round-trip time information can potentially expose some
    information useful for approximate geolocation, as discussed in
    \[[PAM-RTT](#PAM-RTT){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2.3.1-2.8.4){.pilcrow}

:   

Variation in Delay:
:   Some network applications are sensitive to (small) changes in packet
    timing (jitter). Short- and long-term delay variation can impact the
    latency of a flow and hence the perceived quality of applications
    using a network path. For example, jitter metrics are often cited
    when characterising paths supporting real-time traffic. The expected
    performance of such applications can be inferred from a measure of
    the variation in delay observed along a portion of the path
    \[[RFC3393](#RFC3393){.xref}\] \[[RFC5481](#RFC5481){.xref}\]. The
    requirements resemble those for the measurement of
    latency.[¶](#section-2.3.1-2.10){.pilcrow}
:   

Flow Reordering:

:   Significant packet reordering within a flow can impact time-critical
    applications and can be interpreted as loss by reliable transports.
    Many transport protocol techniques are impacted by reordering (e.g.,
    triggering TCP retransmission or rebuffering of real-time
    applications). Packet reordering can occur for many reasons, e.g.,
    from equipment design to misconfiguration of forwarding rules. Flow
    identification is often required to avoid significant packet
    misordering (e.g., when using ECMP, or LAG). Network tools can
    detect and measure unwanted/excessive reordering and the impact on
    transport performance.[¶](#section-2.3.1-2.12.1){.pilcrow}

    There have been initiatives in the IETF transport area to reduce the
    impact of reordering within a transport flow, possibly leading to a
    reduction in the requirements for preserving ordering. These have
    potential to simplify network equipment design as well as the
    potential to improve robustness of the transport service.
    Measurements of reordering can help understand the present level of
    reordering and inform decisions about how to progress new
    mechanisms.[¶](#section-2.3.1-2.12.2){.pilcrow}

    Techniques for measuring reordering typically observe packet
    sequence numbers. Metrics have been defined that evaluate whether a
    network path has maintained packet order on a packet-by-packet basis
    \[[RFC4737](#RFC4737){.xref}\] \[[RFC5236](#RFC5236){.xref}\]. Some
    protocols provide in-built monitoring and reporting functions.
    Transport fields in the RTP header \[[RFC3550](#RFC3550){.xref}\]
    \[[RFC4585](#RFC4585){.xref}\] can be observed to derive traffic
    volume measurements and provide information on the progress and
    quality of a session using RTP. Metadata assists in understanding
    the context under which the data was collected, including the time,
    observation point \[[RFC7799](#RFC7799){.xref}\], and way in which
    metrics were accumulated. The RTCP protocol directly reports some of
    this information in a form that can be directly visible by devices
    on the network path.[¶](#section-2.3.1-2.12.3){.pilcrow}

:   

In some cases, measurements could involve active injection of test
traffic to perform a measurement (see [Section
3.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7799#section-3.4){.relref} of
\[[RFC7799](#RFC7799){.xref}\]). However, most operators do not have
access to user equipment; therefore, the point of test is normally
different from the transport endpoint. Injection of test traffic can
incur an additional cost in running such tests (e.g., the implications
of capacity tests in a mobile network segment are obvious). Some active
measurements \[[RFC7799](#RFC7799){.xref}\] (e.g., response under load
or particular workloads) perturb other traffic and could require
dedicated access to the network segment.[¶](#section-2.3.1-3){.pilcrow}

Passive measurements (see [Section
3.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7799#section-3.6){.relref} of
\[[RFC7799](#RFC7799){.xref}\]) can have advantages in terms of
eliminating unproductive test traffic, reducing the influence of test
traffic on the overall traffic mix, and having the ability to choose the
point of observation (see [Section 2.4.1](#point){.xref}). Measurements
can rely on observing packet headers, which is not possible if those
headers are encrypted, but could utilise information about traffic
volumes or patterns of interaction to deduce
metrics.[¶](#section-2.3.1-4){.pilcrow}

Passive packet sampling techniques are also often used to scale the
processing involved in observing packets on high-rate links. This
exports only the packet header information of (randomly) selected
packets. Interpretation of the exported information relies on
understanding of the header information. The utility of these
measurements depends on the type of network segment/link and number of
mechanisms used by the network devices. Simple routers are relatively
easy to manage, but a device with more complexity demands understanding
of the choice of many system parameters.[¶](#section-2.3.1-5){.pilcrow}

Information from the transport header can be used by a multi-field (MF)
classifier as a part of policy framework. Policies are commonly used for
management of the QoS or Quality of Experience (QoE) in
resource-constrained networks or by firewalls to implement access rules
(see also [Section
2.2.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8404#section-2.2.2){.relref} of
\[[RFC8404](#RFC8404){.xref}\]). Policies can support user
applications/services or protect against unwanted or lower-priority
traffic ([Section
2.4.4](#Implic-Unknown){.xref}).[¶](#section-2.3.2-1){.pilcrow}

Transport-layer information can also be explicitly carried in
network-layer header fields that are not encrypted, serving as a
replacement/addition to the exposed transport header information
\[[RFC8558](#RFC8558){.xref}\]. This information can enable a different
forwarding treatment by the devices forming the network path, even when
a transport employs encryption to protect other header
information.[¶](#section-2.3.2-2){.pilcrow}

On the one hand, the user of a transport that multiplexes multiple
subflows might want to obscure the presence and characteristics of these
subflows. On the other hand, an encrypted transport could set the
network-layer information to indicate the presence of subflows and to
reflect the service requirements of individual subflows. There are
several ways this could be done:[¶](#section-2.3.2-3){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

IP Address:
:   Applications normally expose the endpoint addresses used in the
    forwarding decisions in network devices. Address and other protocol
    information can be used by an MF classifier to determine how traffic
    is treated \[[RFC2475](#RFC2475){.xref}\] and hence affects the
    quality of experience for a flow. Common issues concerning IP
    address sharing are described in
    \[[RFC6269](#RFC6269){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2.3.2-4.2){.pilcrow}
:   

Using the IPv6 Network-Layer Flow Label:

:   A number of Standards Track and Best Current Practice RFCs (e.g.,
    \[[RFC8085](#RFC8085){.xref}\], \[[RFC6437](#RFC6437){.xref}\], and
    \[[RFC6438](#RFC6438){.xref}\]) encourage endpoints to set the IPv6
    Flow Label field of the network-layer header. As per
    \[[RFC6437](#RFC6437){.xref}\], IPv6 source nodes \"[SHOULD]{.bcp14}
    assign each unrelated transport connection and application data
    stream to a new flow.\" A multiplexing transport could choose to use
    multiple flow labels to allow the network to independently forward
    subflows. \[[RFC6437](#RFC6437){.xref}\] provides further guidance
    on choosing a flow label value, stating these \"should be chosen
    such that their bits exhibit a high degree of variability\" and
    chosen so that \"third parties should be unlikely to be able to
    guess the next value that a source of flow labels will
    choose.\"[¶](#section-2.3.2-4.4.1){.pilcrow}

    Once set, a flow label can provide information that can help inform
    network-layer queueing and forwarding, including use with IPsec
    \[[RFC6294](#RFC6294){.xref}\], Equal-Cost Multipath routing, and
    Link Aggregation
    \[[RFC6438](#RFC6438){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2.3.2-4.4.2){.pilcrow}

    The choice of how to assign a flow label needs to avoid introducing
    linkages between flows that a network device could not otherwise
    observe. Inappropriate use by the transport can have privacy
    implications (e.g., assigning the same label to two independent
    flows that ought not to be classified
    similarly).[¶](#section-2.3.2-4.4.3){.pilcrow}

:   

Using the Network-Layer Differentiated Services Code Point:
:   Applications can expose their delivery expectations to network
    devices by setting the Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP)
    field of IPv4 and IPv6 packets \[[RFC2474](#RFC2474){.xref}\]. For
    example, WebRTC applications identify different forwarding
    treatments for individual subflows (audio vs. video) based on the
    value of the DSCP field \[[RFC8837](#RFC8837){.xref}\]). This
    provides explicit information to inform network-layer queueing and
    forwarding, rather than an operator inferring traffic requirements
    from transport and application headers via a multi-field classifier.
    Inappropriate use by the transport can have privacy implications
    (e.g., assigning a different DSCP to a subflow could assist in a
    network device discovering the traffic pattern used by an
    application). The field is mutable, i.e., some network devices can
    be expected to change this field. Since the DSCP value can impact
    the quality of experience for a flow, observations of service
    performance have to consider this field when a network path supports
    differentiated service treatment.[¶](#section-2.3.2-4.6){.pilcrow}
:   

Using Explicit Congestion Notification:

:   Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN)
    \[[RFC3168](#RFC3168){.xref}\] is a transport mechanism that uses
    the ECN field in the network-layer header. Use of ECN explicitly
    informs the network layer that a transport is ECN capable and
    requests ECN treatment of the flow. An ECN-capable transport can
    offer benefits when used over a path with equipment that implements
    an AQM method with Congestion Experienced (CE) marking of IP packets
    \[[RFC8087](#RFC8087){.xref}\], since it can react to congestion
    without also having to recover from lost
    packets.[¶](#section-2.3.2-4.8.1){.pilcrow}

    ECN exposes the presence of congestion. The reception of CE-marked
    packets can be used to estimate the level of incipient congestion on
    the upstream portion of the path from the point of observation
    ([Section
    2.5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8087#section-2.5){.relref} of
    \[[RFC8087](#RFC8087){.xref}\]). Interpreting the marking behaviour
    (i.e., assessing congestion and diagnosing faults) requires context
    from the transport layer, such as path
    RTT.[¶](#section-2.3.2-4.8.2){.pilcrow}

    AQM and ECN offer a range of algorithms and configuration options.
    Tools therefore have to be available to network operators and
    researchers to understand the implication of configuration choices
    and transport behaviour as the use of ECN increases and new methods
    emerge
    \[[RFC7567](#RFC7567){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2.3.2-4.8.3){.pilcrow}

:   

Network-Layer Options:

:   Network protocols can carry optional headers (see [Section
    5.1](#EH){.xref}). These can explicitly expose transport header
    information to on-path devices operating at the network layer (as
    discussed further in [Section
    6](#OAM){.xref}).[¶](#section-2.3.2-4.10.1){.pilcrow}

    IPv4 \[[RFC0791](#RFC0791){.xref}\] has provisions for optional
    header fields. IP routers can examine these headers and are required
    to ignore IPv4 options that they do not recognise. Many current
    paths include network devices that forward packets that carry
    options on a slower processing path. Some network devices (e.g.,
    firewalls) can be (and are) configured to drop these packets
    \[[RFC7126](#RFC7126){.xref}\]. BCP 186
    \[[RFC7126](#RFC7126){.xref}\] provides guidance on how operators
    should treat IPv4 packets that specify
    options.[¶](#section-2.3.2-4.10.2){.pilcrow}

    IPv6 can encode optional network-layer information in separate
    headers that may be placed between the IPv6 header and the
    upper-layer header \[[RFC8200](#RFC8200){.xref}\] (e.g., the IPv6
    Alternate Marking Method
    \[[IPV6-ALT-MARK](#I-D.ietf-6man-ipv6-alt-mark){.xref}\], which can
    be used to measure packet loss and delay metrics). The Hop-by-Hop
    Options header, when present, immediately follows the IPv6 header.
    IPv6 permits this header to be examined by any node along the path
    if explicitly configured
    \[[RFC8200](#RFC8200){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2.3.2-4.10.3){.pilcrow}

Careful use of the network-layer features (e.g., extension headers can;

Some network operators make use of on-path observations of transport
headers to analyse the service offered to the users of a network segment
and inform operational practice and can help detect and locate network
problems. \[[RFC8517](#RFC8517){.xref}\] gives an operator\'s
perspective about such use.[¶](#section-2.4-1){.pilcrow}

When observable transport header information is not available, those
seeking an understanding of transport behaviour and dynamics might learn
to work without that information. Alternatively, they might use more
limited measurements combined with pattern inference and other
heuristics to infer network behaviour (see [Section
2.1.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8404#section-2.1.1){.relref} of

inferring transport parameters are out of scope for this document and
are only mentioned here to recognise that encryption does not
necessarily stop operators from attempting to apply practises that have

#### [2.4.1.](#section-2.4.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Problem Location](#name-problem-location){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-problem-location}

Observations of transport header information can be used to locate the
source of problems or to assess the performance of a network segment.
Often issues can only be understood in the context of the other flows
that share a particular path, particular device configuration, interface
port, etc. A simple example is monitoring of a network device that uses
a scheduler or active queue management technique
\[[RFC7567](#RFC7567){.xref}\], where it could be desirable to
understand whether the algorithms are correctly controlling latency or
if overload protection is working. This implies knowledge of how traffic
is assigned to any subqueues used for flow scheduling but can require
information about how the traffic dynamics impact active queue
management, starvation prevention mechanisms, and circuit
breakers.[¶](#section-2.4.1-1){.pilcrow}

Sometimes correlating observations of headers at multiple points along
the path (e.g., at the ingress and egress of a network segment) allows
an observer to determine the contribution of a portion of the path to an
observed metric (e.g., to locate a source of delay, jitter, loss,
reordering, or congestion marking).[¶](#section-2.4.1-2){.pilcrow}

The traffic that can be observed by on-path network devices (the \"wire
image\") is a function of transport protocol design/options, network
use, applications, and user characteristics. In general, when only a
small proportion of the traffic has a specific (different)
characteristic, such traffic seldom leads to operational concern,
although the ability to measure and monitor it is lower. The desire to
understand the traffic and protocol interactions typically grows as the
proportion of traffic increases. The challenges increase when multiple
instances of an evolving protocol contribute to the traffic that share
network capacity.[¶](#section-2.4.3-1){.pilcrow}

Operators can manage traffic load (e.g., when the network is severely
overloaded) by deploying rate limiters, traffic shaping, or network
transport circuit breakers \[[RFC8084](#RFC8084){.xref}\]. The
information provided by observing transport headers is a source of data
that can help to inform such mechanisms.[¶](#section-2.4.3-2){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

Congestion Control Compliance of Traffic:

:   Congestion control is a key transport function
    \[[RFC2914](#RFC2914){.xref}\]. Many network operators implicitly
    accept that TCP traffic complies with a behaviour that is acceptable
    for the shared Internet. TCP algorithms have been continuously
    improved over decades and have reached a level of efficiency and
    correctness that is difficult to match in custom application-layer
    mechanisms
    \[[RFC8085](#RFC8085){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2.4.3-3.2.1){.pilcrow}

    A standards-compliant TCP stack provides congestion control that is
    judged safe for use across the Internet. Applications developed on
    top of well-designed transports can be expected to appropriately
    control their network usage, reacting when the network experiences
    congestion, by backing off and reducing the load placed on the
    network. This is the normal expected behaviour for IETF-specified
    transports (e.g., TCP and SCTP).[¶](#section-2.4.3-3.2.2){.pilcrow}

:   

Congestion Control Compliance for UDP Traffic:

:   UDP provides a minimal message-passing datagram transport that has
    no inherent congestion control mechanisms. Because congestion
    control is critical to the stable operation of the Internet,
    applications and other protocols that choose to use UDP as a
    transport have to employ mechanisms to prevent collapse, avoid
    unacceptable contributions to jitter/latency, and establish an
    acceptable share of capacity with concurrent traffic
    \[[RFC8085](#RFC8085){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2.4.3-3.4.1){.pilcrow}

    UDP flows that expose a well-known header can be observed to gain
    understanding of the dynamics of a flow and its congestion control
    behaviour. For example, tools exist to monitor various aspects of
    RTP header information and RTCP reports for real-time flows (see
    [Section 2.3](#stats){.xref}). The Secure RTP and RTCP extensions
    \[[RFC3711](#RFC3711){.xref}\] were explicitly designed to expose
    some header information to enable such observation while protecting
    the payload data.[¶](#section-2.4.3-3.4.2){.pilcrow}

    A network operator can observe the headers of transport protocols
    layered above UDP to understand if the datagram flows comply with
    congestion control expectations. This can help inform a decision on
    whether it might be appropriate to deploy methods, such as rate
    limiters, to enforce acceptable usage. The available information
    determines the level of precision with which flows can be classified
    and the design space for conditioning mechanisms (e.g.,
    rate-limiting, circuit breaker techniques
    \[[RFC8084](#RFC8084){.xref}\], or blocking uncharacterised traffic)
    \[[RFC5218](#RFC5218){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2.4.3-3.4.3){.pilcrow}

:   

When anomalies are detected, tools can interpret the transport header
information to help understand the impact of specific transport
protocols (or protocol mechanisms) on the other traffic that shares a
network. An observer on the network path can gain an understanding of
the dynamics of a flow and its congestion control behaviour. Analysing
observed flows can help to build confidence that an application flow
backs off its share of the network load under persistent congestion and
hence to understand whether the behaviour is appropriate for sharing
limited network capacity. For example, it is common to visualise plots
of TCP sequence numbers versus time for a flow to understand how a flow
shares available capacity, deduce its dynamics in response to
congestion, etc.[¶](#section-2.4.3-4){.pilcrow}

The ability to identify sources and flows that contribute to persistent
congestion is important to the safe operation of network infrastructure
and can inform configuration of network devices to complement the
endpoint congestion avoidance mechanisms \[[RFC7567](#RFC7567){.xref}\]

Encryption can increase the volume of \"unknown\" or \"uncharacterised\"

A variety of open source and proprietary tools have been deployed that
use the transport header information observable with widely used
protocols, such as TCP or RTP/UDP/IP. Tools that dissect network traffic
flows can alert to potential problems that are hard to derive from
volume measurements, link statistics, or device measurements
alone.[¶](#section-2.4.7-1){.pilcrow}

Any introduction of a new transport protocol, protocol feature, or
application might require changes to such tools and could impact
operational practice and policies. Such changes have associated costs
that are incurred by the network operators that need to update their
tooling or develop alternative practises that work without access to the
changed/removed information.[¶](#section-2.4.7-2){.pilcrow}

The use of encryption has the desirable effect of preventing unintended
observation of the payload data, and these tools seldom seek to observe
the payload or other application details. A flow that hides its
transport header information could imply \"don\'t touch\" to some
operators. This might limit a trouble-shooting response to \"can\'t
help, no trouble found\".[¶](#section-2.4.7-3){.pilcrow}

An alternative that does not require access to an observable transport
headers is to access endpoint diagnostic tools or to include user
involvement in diagnosing and troubleshooting unusual use cases or to
troubleshoot nontrivial problems. Another approach is to use traffic
pattern analysis. Such tools can provide useful information during
network anomalies (e.g., detecting significant reordering, high or
intermittent loss); however, indirect measurements need to be carefully
designed to provide information for diagnostics and
troubleshooting.[¶](#section-2.4.7-4){.pilcrow}

If new protocols, or protocol extensions, are made to closely resemble
or match existing mechanisms, then the changes to tooling and the
associated costs can be small. Equally, more extensive changes to the
transport tend to require more extensive, and more expensive, changes to
tooling and operational practice. Protocol designers can mitigate these
costs by explicitly choosing to expose selected information as
invariants that are guaranteed not to change for a particular protocol
(e.g., the header invariants and the spin bit in QUIC
\[[RFC9000](#RFC9000){.xref}\]). Specification of common log formats and
development of alternative approaches can also help mitigate the costs
of transport changes.[¶](#section-2.4.7-5){.pilcrow}

Some link and network segments are constrained by the capacity they can
offer by the time it takes to access capacity (e.g., due to underlying
radio resource management methods) or by asymmetries in the design
(e.g., many link are designed so that the capacity available is
different in the forward and return directions; some radio technologies
have different access methods in the forward and return directions
resulting from differences in the power
budget).[¶](#section-2.5-1){.pilcrow}

The impact of path constraints can be mitigated using a proxy operating
at or above the transport layer to use an alternate transport
protocol.[¶](#section-2.5-2){.pilcrow}

In many cases, one or both endpoints are unaware of the characteristics
of the constraining link or network segment, and mitigations are applied
below the transport layer. Packet classification and QoS methods
(described in various sections) can be beneficial in differentially
prioritising certain traffic when there is a capacity constraint or
additional delay in scheduling link transmissions. Another common
mitigation is to apply header compression over the specific link or
subnetwork (see [Section
2.5.1](#HC){.xref}).[¶](#section-2.5-3){.pilcrow}

Header compression saves link capacity by compressing network and
transport protocol headers on a per-hop basis. This has been widely used
with low bandwidth dial-up access links and still finds application on
wireless links that are subject to capacity constraints. These methods
are effective for bit-congestive links sending small packets (e.g.,
reducing the cost for sending control packets or small data packets over
radio links).[¶](#section-2.5.1-1){.pilcrow}

Examples of header compression include use with TCP/IP and RTP/UDP/IP
flows \[[RFC2507](#RFC2507){.xref}\] \[[RFC6846](#RFC6846){.xref}\]
\[[RFC2508](#RFC2508){.xref}\] \[[RFC5795](#RFC5795){.xref}\]
\[[RFC8724](#RFC8724){.xref}\]. Successful compression depends on
observing the transport headers and understanding the way fields change
between packets and is hence incompatible with header encryption.
Devices that compress transport headers are dependent on a stable header
format, implying ossification of that
format.[¶](#section-2.5.1-2){.pilcrow}

Introducing a new transport protocol, or changing the format of the
transport header information, will limit the effectiveness of header
compression until the network devices are updated. Encrypting the
transport protocol headers will tend to cause the header compression to
fall back to compressing only the network-layer headers, with a
significant reduction in efficiency. This can limit connectivity if the
resulting flow exceeds the link capacity or if the packets are dropped
because they exceed the link Maximum Transmission Unit
(MTU).[¶](#section-2.5.1-3){.pilcrow}

The Secure RTP (SRTP) extensions \[[RFC3711](#RFC3711){.xref}\] were
explicitly designed to leave the transport protocol headers unencrypted,
but authenticated, since support for header compression was considered
important.[¶](#section-2.5.1-4){.pilcrow}

Research and development of new protocols and mechanisms need to be
informed by measurement data (as described in the previous section).
Data can also help promote acceptance of proposed standards
specifications by the wider community (e.g., as a method to judge the
safety for Internet deployment).[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

Observed data is important to ensure the health of the research and
development communities and provides data needed to evaluate new
proposals for standardisation. Open standards motivate a desire to
include independent observation and evaluation of performance and
deployment data. Independent data helps compare different methods, judge
the level of deployment, and ensure the wider applicability of the
results. This is important when considering when a protocol or mechanism
should be standardised for use in the general Internet. This, in turn,
demands control/understanding about where and when measurement samples
are collected. This requires consideration of the methods used to
observe information and the appropriate balance between encrypting all
and no transport header information.[¶](#section-3-2){.pilcrow}

There can be performance and operational trade-offs in exposing selected
information to network tools. This section explores key implications of
tools and procedures that observe transport protocols but does not

Encrypting transport header information has implications on the way
network data is collected and analysed. Independent observations by
multiple actors is currently used by the transport community to maintain
an accurate understanding of the network within transport area working
groups, IRTF research groups, and the broader research community. This
is important to be able to provide accountability and demonstrate that
protocols behave as intended; although, when providing or using such
information, it is important to consider the privacy of the user and
their incentive for providing accurate and detailed
information.[¶](#section-3.1-1){.pilcrow}

Protocols that expose the state of the transport protocol in their
header (e.g., timestamps used to calculate the RTT, packet numbers used
to assess congestion, and requests for retransmission) provide an
incentive for a sending endpoint to provide consistent information,
because a protocol will not work otherwise. An on-path observer can have
confidence that well-known (and ossified) transport header information
represents the actual state of the endpoints when this information is
necessary for the protocol\'s correct
operation.[¶](#section-3.1-2){.pilcrow}

Encryption of transport header information could reduce the range of
actors that can observe useful data. This would limit the information
sources available to the Internet community to understand the operation
of new transport protocols, reducing information to inform design
decisions and standardisation of the new protocols and related
operational practises. The cooperating dependence of network,
application, and host to provide communication performance on the
Internet is uncertain when only endpoints (i.e., at user devices and
within service platforms) can observe performance and when performance
cannot be independently verified by all
parties.[¶](#section-3.1-3){.pilcrow}

Transport protocol evolution and the ability to measure and understand
the impact of protocol changes have to proceed hand-in-hand. A transport
protocol that provides observable headers can be used to provide open
and verifiable measurement data. Observation of pathologies has a
critical role in the design of transport protocol mechanisms and
development of new mechanisms and protocols and aides in understanding
the interactions between cooperating protocols and network mechanisms,
the implications of sharing capacity with other traffic, and the impact
of different patterns of usage. The ability of other stakeholders to
review transport header traces helps develop insight into the
performance and the traffic contribution of specific variants of a
protocol.[¶](#section-3.2-1){.pilcrow}

Development of new transport protocol mechanisms has to consider the
scale of deployment and the range of environments in which the transport
is used. Experience has shown that it is often difficult to correctly
implement new mechanisms \[[RFC8085](#RFC8085){.xref}\] and that
mechanisms often evolve as a protocol matures or in response to changes
in network conditions, in network traffic, or to application usage.
Analysis is especially valuable when based on the behaviour experienced
across a range of topologies, vendor equipment, and traffic
patterns.[¶](#section-3.2-2){.pilcrow}

Encryption enables a transport protocol to choose which internal state
to reveal to devices on the network path, what information to encrypt,
and what fields to grease \[[RFC8701](#RFC8701){.xref}\]. A new design
can provide summary information regarding its performance, congestion
control state, etc., or make explicit measurement information available.
For example, \[[RFC9000](#RFC9000){.xref}\] specifies a way for a QUIC
endpoint to optionally set the spin bit to explicitly reveal the RTT of
an encrypted transport session to the on-path network devices. There is
a choice of what information to expose. For some operational uses, the
information has to contain sufficient detail to understand, and possibly
reconstruct, the network traffic pattern for further testing. The
interpretation of the information needs to consider whether this
information reflects the actual transport state of the endpoints. This
might require the trust of transport protocol implementers to correctly
reveal the desired information.[¶](#section-3.2-3){.pilcrow}

New transport protocol formats are expected to facilitate an increased
pace of transport evolution and with it the possibility to experiment
with and deploy a wide range of protocol mechanisms. At the time of
writing, there has been interest in a wide range of new transport
methods, e.g., larger initial window, Proportional Rate Reduction (PRR),
congestion control methods based on measuring bottleneck bandwidth and
round-trip propagation time, the introduction of AQM techniques, and new
forms of ECN response (e.g., Data Centre TCP, DCTCP, and methods
proposed for Low Latency Low Loss Scalable throughput (L4S)). The growth
and diversity of applications and protocols using the Internet also
continues to expand. For each new method or application, it is desirable
to build a body of data reflecting its behaviour under a wide range of
deployment scenarios, traffic load, and interactions with other
deployed/candidate methods.[¶](#section-3.2-4){.pilcrow}

### [3.3.](#section-3.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Other Sources of Information](#name-other-sources-of-informatio){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-other-sources-of-informatio}

Some measurements that traditionally rely on observable transport
information could be completed by utilising endpoint-based logging
(e.g., based on [QUIC trace](#Quic-Trace){.xref}
\[[Quic-Trace](#Quic-Trace){.xref}\] and
[qlog](#I-D.ietf-quic-qlog-main-schema){.xref}
\[[QLOG](#I-D.ietf-quic-qlog-main-schema){.xref}\]). Such information
has a diversity of uses, including developers wishing to
debug/understand the transport/application protocols with which they
work, researchers seeking to spot trends and anomalies, and to
characterise variants of protocols. A standard format for endpoint
logging could allow these to be shared (after appropriate anonymisation)
to understand performance and pathologies.[¶](#section-3.3-1){.pilcrow}

When measurement datasets are made available by servers or client
endpoints, additional metadata, such as the state of the network and
conditions in which the system was observed, is often necessary to
interpret this data to answer questions about network performance or
understand a pathology. Collecting and coordinating such metadata is
more difficult when the observation point is at a different location to
the bottleneck or device under evaluation
\[[RFC7799](#RFC7799){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3.3-2){.pilcrow}

Despite being applicable in some scenarios, endpoint logs do not provide
equivalent information to on-path measurements made by devices in the
network. In particular, endpoint logs contain only a part of the
information to understand the operation of network devices and identify
issues, such as link performance or capacity sharing between multiple
flows. An analysis can require coordination between actors at different
layers to successfully characterise flows and correlate the performance
or behaviour of a specific mechanism with an equipment configuration and
traffic using operational equipment along a network path (e.g.,
combining transport and network measurements to explore congestion
control dynamics to understand the implications of traffic on designs
for active queue management or circuit
breakers).[¶](#section-3.3-3){.pilcrow}

Another source of information could arise from Operations,
Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) (see [Section 6](#OAM){.xref}).
Information data records could be embedded into header information at
different layers to support functions, such as performance evaluation,
path tracing, path verification information, classification, and a
diversity of other uses.[¶](#section-3.3-4){.pilcrow}

In-situ OAM (IOAM) data fields
\[[IOAM-DATA](#I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data){.xref}\] can be encapsulated
into a variety of protocols to record operational and telemetry
information in an existing packet while that packet traverses a part of
the path between two points in a network (e.g., within a particular IOAM
management domain). IOAM-Data-Fields are independent from the protocols
into which IOAM-Data-Fields are encapsulated. For example, IOAM can
provide proof that a traffic flow takes a predefined path, SLA
verification for the live data traffic, and statistics relating to
traffic distribution.[¶](#section-3.3-5){.pilcrow}

## [4.](#section-4){.section-number .selfRef} [Encryption and Authentication of Transport Headers](#name-encryption-and-authenticati){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-encryption-and-authenticati}

There are several motivations for transport header
encryption.[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

One motive to encrypt transport headers is to prevent network
ossification from network devices that inspect well-known transport
headers. Once a network device observes a transport header and becomes
reliant upon using it, the overall use of that field can become
ossified, preventing new versions of the protocol and mechanisms from
being deployed. Examples include:[¶](#section-4-2){.pilcrow}

-   [During the development of TLS 1.3 \[[RFC8446](#RFC8446){.xref}\],
    the design needed to function in the presence of deployed
    middleboxes that relied on the presence of certain header fields
    exposed in TLS 1.2
    \[[RFC5426](#RFC5426){.xref}\].[¶](#section-4-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-4-3.1}
-   [The design of Multipath TCP (MPTCP) \[[RFC8684](#RFC8684){.xref}\]
    had to account for middleboxes (known as \"TCP Normalizers\") that
    monitor the evolution of the window advertised in the TCP header and
    then reset connections when the window did not grow as
    expected.[¶](#section-4-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-4-3.2}
-   [TCP Fast Open \[[RFC7413](#RFC7413){.xref}\] can experience
    problems due to middleboxes that modify the transport header of
    packets by removing \"unknown\" TCP options. Segments with
    unrecognised TCP options can be dropped, segments that contain data
    and set the SYN bit can be dropped, and some middleboxes that
    disrupt connections can send data before completion of the three-way
    handshake.[¶](#section-4-3.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-4-3.3}
-   [Other examples of TCP ossification have included middleboxes that
    modify transport headers by rewriting TCP sequence and
    acknowledgement numbers but are unaware of the (newer) TCP selective
    acknowledgement (SACK) option and therefore fail to correctly
    rewrite the SACK information to match the changes made to the fixed
    TCP header, preventing correct SACK
    operation.[¶](#section-4-3.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-4-3.4}

In all these cases, middleboxes with a hard-coded, but incomplete,
understanding of a specific transport behaviour (i.e., TCP) interacted
poorly with transport protocols after the transport behaviour was
changed. In some cases, the middleboxes modified or replaced information
in the transport protocol header.[¶](#section-4-4){.pilcrow}

Transport header encryption prevents an on-path device from observing
the transport headers and therefore stops ossified mechanisms being used
that directly rely on or infer semantics of the transport header
information. This encryption is normally combined with authentication of
the protected information. \[[RFC8546](#RFC8546){.xref}\] summarises
this approach, stating that \"\[t\]he wire image, not the protocol\'s
specification, determines how third parties on the network paths among
protocol participants will interact with that protocol\" ([Section
1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8546#section-1){.relref} of
\[[RFC8546](#RFC8546){.xref}\]), and it can be expected that header
information that is not encrypted will become
ossified.[¶](#section-4-5){.pilcrow}

Encryption does not itself prevent ossification of the network service.
People seeking to understand or classify network traffic could still
come to rely on pattern inferences and other heuristics or machine
learning to derive measurement data and as the basis for network
forwarding decisions \[[RFC8546](#RFC8546){.xref}\]. This can also
create dependencies on the transport protocol or the patterns of traffic
it can generate, also resulting in ossification of the
service.[¶](#section-4-6){.pilcrow}

Another motivation for using transport header encryption is to improve
privacy and to decrease opportunities for surveillance. Users value the
ability to protect their identity and location and defend against
analysis of the traffic. Revelations about the use of pervasive
surveillance \[[RFC7624](#RFC7624){.xref}\] have, to some extent, eroded
trust in the service offered by network operators and have led to an
increased use of encryption. Concerns have also been voiced about the
addition of metadata to packets by third parties to provide analytics,
customisation, advertising, cross-site tracking of users, customer
billing, or selectively allowing or blocking
content.[¶](#section-4-7){.pilcrow}

Whatever the reasons, the IETF is designing protocols that include
transport header encryption (e.g., QUIC \[[RFC9000](#RFC9000){.xref}\])
to supplement the already widespread payload encryption and to further
limit exposure of transport metadata to the
network.[¶](#section-4-8){.pilcrow}

If a transport protocol uses header encryption, the designers have to
decide whether to encrypt all or a part of the transport-layer
information. [Section
4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8558#section-4){.relref} of
\[[RFC8558](#RFC8558){.xref}\] states, \"Anything exposed to the path
should be done with the intent that it be used by the network elements
on the path.\"[¶](#section-4-9){.pilcrow}

Certain transport header fields can be made observable to on-path
network devices or can define new fields designed to explicitly expose
observable transport-layer information to the network. Where exposed
fields are intended to be immutable (i.e., can be observed but not
modified by a network device), the endpoints are encouraged to use
authentication to provide a cryptographic integrity check that can
detect if these immutable fields have been modified by network devices.
Authentication can help to prevent attacks that rely on sending packets
that fake exposed control signals in transport headers (e.g., TCP RST
spoofing). Making a part of a transport header observable or exposing
new header fields can lead to ossification of that part of a header as
network devices come to rely on observations of the exposed
fields.[¶](#section-4-10){.pilcrow}

The use of transport header authentication and encryption therefore
exposes a tussle between middlebox vendors, operators, researchers,
applications developers, and end users:[¶](#section-4-11){.pilcrow}

-   [On the one hand, future Internet protocols that support transport
    header encryption assist in the restoration of the end-to-end nature
    of the Internet by returning complex processing to the endpoints.
    Since middleboxes cannot modify what they cannot see, the use of
    transport header encryption can improve application and end-user
    privacy by reducing leakage of transport metadata to operators that
    deploy middleboxes.[¶](#section-4-12.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-4-12.1}
-   [On the other hand, encryption of transport-layer information has
    implications for network operators and researchers seeking to
    understand the dynamics of protocols and traffic patterns, since it
    reduces the information that is available to
    them.[¶](#section-4-12.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-4-12.2}

The following briefly reviews some security design options for transport
protocols. \"A Survey of the Interaction between Security Protocols and
Transport Services\" \[[RFC8922](#RFC8922){.xref}\] provides more
details concerning commonly used encryption methods at the transport
layer.[¶](#section-4-13){.pilcrow}

Security work typically employs a design technique that seeks to expose
only what is needed \[[RFC3552](#RFC3552){.xref}\]. This approach
provides incentives to not reveal any information that is not necessary
for the end-to-end communication. The IETF has provided guidelines for
writing security considerations for IETF specifications
\[[RFC3552](#RFC3552){.xref}\].[¶](#section-4-14){.pilcrow}

Endpoint design choices impacting privacy also need to be considered as
a part of the design process \[[RFC6973](#RFC6973){.xref}\]. The IAB has
provided guidance for analysing and documenting privacy considerations
within IETF specifications
\[[RFC6973](#RFC6973){.xref}\].[¶](#section-4-15){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

Authenticating the Transport Protocol Header:

:   Transport-layer header information can be authenticated. An example
    transport authentication mechanism is TCP Authentication Option
    (TCP-AO) \[[RFC5925](#RFC5925){.xref}\]. This TCP option
    authenticates the IP pseudo-header, TCP header, and TCP data. TCP-AO
    protects the transport layer, preventing attacks from disabling the
    TCP connection itself and provides replay protection. Such
    authentication might interact with middleboxes, depending on their
    behaviour
    \[[RFC3234](#RFC3234){.xref}\].[¶](#section-4-16.2.1){.pilcrow}

    The IPsec Authentication Header (AH) \[[RFC4302](#RFC4302){.xref}\]
    was designed to work at the network layer and authenticate the IP
    payload. This approach authenticates all transport headers and
    verifies their integrity at the receiver, preventing modification by
    network devices on the path. The IPsec Encapsulating Security
    Payload (ESP) \[[RFC4303](#RFC4303){.xref}\] can also provide
    authentication and integrity without confidentiality using the NULL
    encryption algorithm \[[RFC2410](#RFC2410){.xref}\]. SRTP
    \[[RFC3711](#RFC3711){.xref}\] is another example of a transport
    protocol that allows header
    authentication.[¶](#section-4-16.2.2){.pilcrow}

:   

Integrity Check:
:   Transport protocols usually employ integrity checks on the transport
    header information. Security methods usually employ stronger checks
    and can combine this with authentication. An integrity check that
    protects the immutable transport header fields, but can still expose
    the transport header information in the clear, allows on-path
    network devices to observe these fields. An integrity check is not
    able to prevent modification by network devices on the path but can
    prevent a receiving endpoint from accepting changes and avoid impact
    on the transport protocol operation, including some types of
    attack.[¶](#section-4-16.4){.pilcrow}
:   

Selectively Encrypting Transport Headers and Payload:

:   A transport protocol design that encrypts selected header fields
    allows specific transport header fields to be made observable by
    network devices on the path. This information is explicitly exposed
    either in a transport header field or lower layer protocol header. A
    design that only exposes immutable fields can also perform
    end-to-end authentication of these fields across the path to prevent
    undetected modification of the immutable transport
    headers.[¶](#section-4-16.6.1){.pilcrow}

    Mutable fields in the transport header provide opportunities where
    on-path network devices can modify the transport behaviour (e.g.,
    the extended headers described in
    \[[PLUS-ABSTRACT-MECH](#I-D.trammell-plus-abstract-mech){.xref}\]).
    An example of a method that encrypts some, but not all, transport
    header information is GRE-in-UDP \[[RFC8086](#RFC8086){.xref}\] when
    used with GRE encryption.[¶](#section-4-16.6.2){.pilcrow}

:   

Optional Encryption of Header Information:
:   There are implications to the use of optional header encryption in
    the design of a transport protocol, where support of optional
    mechanisms can increase the complexity of the protocol and its
    implementation and in the management decisions that have to be made
    to use variable format fields. Instead, fields of a specific type
    ought to be sent with the same level of confidentiality or integrity
    protection.[¶](#section-4-16.8){.pilcrow}
:   

Greasing:

:   Protocols often provide extensibility features, reserving fields or
    values for use by future versions of a specification. The
    specification of receivers has traditionally ignored unspecified
    values; however, on-path network devices have emerged that ossify to
    require a certain value in a field or reuse a field for another
    purpose. When the specification is later updated, it is impossible
    to deploy the new use of the field and forwarding of the protocol
    could even become conditional on a specific header field
    value.[¶](#section-4-16.10.1){.pilcrow}

    A protocol can intentionally vary the value, format, and/or presence
    of observable transport header fields at random
    \[[RFC8701](#RFC8701){.xref}\]. This prevents a network device
    ossifying the use of a specific observable field and can ease future
    deployment of new uses of the value or code point. This is not a
    security mechanism, although the use can be combined with an
    authentication mechanism.[¶](#section-4-16.10.2){.pilcrow}

fields. One approach is to make an explicit choice not to encrypt
certain transport header fields, making this transport information
observable by an on-path network device. Another approach is to expose
transport information in a network-layer extension header (see [Section
5.1](#EH){.xref}). Both are examples of explicit information intended to
be used by network devices on the path
\[[RFC8558](#RFC8558){.xref}\].[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

Whatever the mechanism used to expose the information, a decision to
expose only specific information places the transport endpoint in
control of what to expose outside of the encrypted transport header.
This decision can then be made independently of the transport protocol
functionality. This can be done by exposing part of the transport header
or as a network-layer option/extension.[¶](#section-5-2){.pilcrow}

### [5.1.](#section-5.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Exposing Transport Information in Extension Headers](#name-exposing-transport-informat){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-exposing-transport-informat}

At the network layer, packets can carry optional headers that explicitly
expose transport header information to the on-path devices operating at
the network layer ([Section 2.3.2](#tunlhf){.xref}). For example, an
endpoint that sends an IPv6 hop-by-hop option
\[[RFC8200](#RFC8200){.xref}\] can provide explicit transport-layer
information that can be observed and used by network devices on the
path. New hop-by-hop options are not recommended in
\[[RFC8200](#RFC8200){.xref}\] \"because nodes may be configured to
ignore the Hop-by-Hop Options header, drop packets containing a
Hop-by-Hop Options header, or assign packets containing a Hop-by-Hop
Options header to a slow processing path. Designers considering defining
new hop-by-hop options need to be aware of this likely
behavior.\"[¶](#section-5.1-1){.pilcrow}

Network-layer optional headers explicitly indicate the information that
is exposed, whereas use of exposed transport header information first
requires an observer to identify the transport protocol and its format.
See [Section 2.2](#Current-demux){.xref}.[¶](#section-5.1-2){.pilcrow}

An arbitrary path can include one or more network devices that drop
packets that include a specific header or option used for this purpose
(see \[[RFC7872](#RFC7872){.xref}\]). This could impact the proper
functioning of the protocols using the path. Protocol methods can be
designed to probe to discover whether the specific option(s) can be used
along the current path, enabling use on arbitrary
paths.[¶](#section-5.1-3){.pilcrow}

Considerations concerning what information, if any, it is appropriate to
expose include:[¶](#section-5.3-1){.pilcrow}

-   [On the one hand, explicitly exposing derived fields containing
    relevant transport information (e.g., metrics for loss, latency,
    etc.) can avoid network devices needing to derive this information
    from other header fields. This could result in development and
    evolution of transport-independent tools around a common observable
    header and permit transport protocols to also evolve independently
    of this ossified header
    \[[RFC8558](#RFC8558){.xref}\].[¶](#section-5.3-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.3-2.1}
-   [On the other hand, protocols and implementations might be designed
    to avoid consistently exposing external information that corresponds
    to the actual internal information used by the protocol itself. An
    endpoint/protocol could choose to expose transport header
    information to optimise the benefit it gets from the network
    \[[RFC8558](#RFC8558){.xref}\]. The value of this information for
    analysing operation of the transport layer would be enhanced if the
    exposed information could be verified to match the transport
    protocol\'s observed
    behavior.[¶](#section-5.3-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.3-2.2}

The motivation to include actual transport header information and the
implications of network devices using this information has to be
considered when proposing such a method. \[[RFC8558](#RFC8558){.xref}\]
summarises this as:[¶](#section-5.3-3){.pilcrow}

> When signals from endpoints to the path are independent from the
> signals used by endpoints to manage the flow\'s state mechanics, they
> may be falsified by an endpoint without affecting the peer\'s

Even when the transport headers are encrypted, on-path devices can make
measurements by utilising additional protocol headers carrying OAM
information in an additional packet header. OAM information can be
included with packets to perform functions, such as identification of
transport protocols and flows, to aide understanding of network or
transport performance or to support network operations or mitigate the
effects of specific network segments.[¶](#section-6-1){.pilcrow}

Using network-layer approaches to reveal information has the potential
that the same method (and hence same observation and analysis tools) can
be consistently used by multiple transport protocols. This approach also
could be applied to methods beyond OAM (see [Section 5](#EH2){.xref}).
There can also be less desirable implications from separating the
operation of the transport protocol from the measurement
framework.[¶](#section-6-2){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-6.1 .section}
### [6.1.](#section-6.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Use of OAM within a Maintenance Domain](#name-use-of-oam-within-a-mainten){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-use-of-oam-within-a-mainten}

OAM information can be restricted to a maintenance domain, typically
owned and operated by a single entity. OAM information can be added at
the ingress to the maintenance domain (e.g., an Ethernet protocol header
with timestamps and sequence number information using a method such as
802.11ag or in-situ OAM \[[IOAM-DATA](#I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data){.xref}\]
or as a part of the encapsulation protocol). This additional header
information is not delivered to the endpoints and is typically removed
at the egress of the maintenance domain.[¶](#section-6.1-1){.pilcrow}

Although some types of measurements are supported, this approach does
not cover the entire range of measurements described in this document.
In some cases, it can be difficult to position measurement tools at the
appropriate segments/nodes, and there can be challenges in correlating
the downstream/upstream information when in-band OAM data is inserted by
an on-path device.[¶](#section-6.1-2){.pilcrow}

OAM information can also be added at the network layer by the sender as
an IPv6 extension header or an IPv4 option or in an encapsulation/tunnel
header that also includes an extension header or option. This
information can be used across multiple network segments or between the
transport endpoints.[¶](#section-6.2-1){.pilcrow}

One example is the IPv6 Performance and Diagnostic Metrics (PDM)
destination option \[[RFC8250](#RFC8250){.xref}\]. This allows a sender
to optionally include a destination option that carries header fields
that can be used to observe timestamps and packet sequence numbers. This
information could be authenticated by a receiving transport endpoint
when the information is added at the sender and visible at the receiving
endpoint, although methods to do this have not currently been proposed.
This needs to be explicitly enabled at the
sender.[¶](#section-6.2-2){.pilcrow}

## [7.](#section-7){.section-number .selfRef} [Conclusions](#name-conclusions){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-conclusions}

Header authentication and encryption and strong integrity checks are
being incorporated into new transport protocols and have important
benefits. The pace of the development of transports using the WebRTC
data channel and the rapid deployment of the QUIC transport protocol can
both be attributed to using the combination of UDP as a substrate while
providing confidentiality and authentication of the encapsulated
transport headers and payload.[¶](#section-7-1){.pilcrow}

This document has described some current practises, and the implications
for some stakeholders, when transport-layer header encryption is used.
It does not judge whether these practises are necessary or endorse the
use of any specific practise. Rather, the intent is to highlight
operational tools and practises to consider when designing and modifying
transport protocols, so protocol designers can make informed choices
about what transport header fields to encrypt and whether it might be
beneficial to make an explicit choice to expose certain fields to
devices on the network path. In making such a decision, it is important
to balance:[¶](#section-7-2){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

User Privacy:
:   The less transport header information that is exposed to the
    network, the lower the risk of leaking metadata that might have user
    privacy implications. Transports that chose to expose some header
    fields need to make a privacy assessment to understand the privacy
    cost versus benefit trade-off in making that information available.
    The design of the QUIC spin bit to the network is an example of such
    considered analysis.[¶](#section-7-3.2){.pilcrow}
:   

Transport Ossification:
:   Unencrypted transport header fields are likely to ossify rapidly, as
    network devices come to rely on their presence, making it difficult
    to change the transport in future. This argues that the choice to
    expose information to the network is made deliberately and with
    care, since it is essentially defining a stable interface between
    the transport and the network. Some protocols will want to make that
    interface as limited as possible; other protocols might find value
    in exposing certain information to signal to the network or in
    allowing the network to change certain header fields as signals to
    the transport. The visible wire image of a protocol should be
    explicitly designed.[¶](#section-7-3.4){.pilcrow}
:   

Network Ossification:
:   While encryption can reduce ossification of the transport protocol,
    it does not itself prevent ossification of the network service.
    People seeking to understand network traffic could still come to
    rely on pattern inferences and other heuristics or machine learning
    to derive measurement data and as the basis for network forwarding
    decisions \[[RFC8546](#RFC8546){.xref}\]. This creates dependencies
    on the transport protocol or the patterns of traffic it can
    generate, resulting in ossification of the
    service.[¶](#section-7-3.6){.pilcrow}
:   

Impact on Operational Practice:
:   The network operations community has long relied on being able to
    understand Internet traffic patterns, both in aggregate and at the
    flow level, to support network management, traffic engineering, and
    troubleshooting. Operational practice has developed based on the
    information available from unencrypted transport headers. The IETF
    has supported this practice by developing operations and management
    specifications, interface specifications, and associated Best
    Current Practices. Widespread deployment of transport protocols that
    encrypt their information will impact network operations unless
    operators can develop alternative practises that work without access
    to the transport header.[¶](#section-7-3.8){.pilcrow}
:   

Pace of Evolution:
:   Removing obstacles to change can enable an increased pace of
    evolution. If a protocol changes its transport header format (wire
    image) or its transport behaviour, this can result in the currently
    deployed tools and methods becoming no longer relevant. Where this
    needs to be accompanied by development of appropriate operational
    support functions and procedures, it can incur a cost in new tooling
    to catch up with each change. Protocols that consistently expose
    observable data do not require such development but can suffer from
    ossification and need to consider if the exposed protocol metadata
    has privacy implications. There is no single deployment context;
    therefore, designers need to consider the diversity of operational
    networks (ISPs, enterprises, DDoS mitigation and firewall
    maintainers, etc.).[¶](#section-7-3.10){.pilcrow}
:   

Supporting Common Specifications:
:   Common, open, transport specifications can stimulate engagement by
    developers, users, researchers, and the broader community. Increased
    protocol diversity can be beneficial in meeting new requirements,
    but the ability to innovate without public scrutiny risks point
    solutions that optimise for specific cases and that can accidentally
    disrupt operations of/in different parts of the network. The social
    contract that maintains the stability of the Internet relies on
    accepting common transport specifications and on it being possible
    to detect violations. The existence of independent measurements,
    transparency, and public scrutiny of transport protocol behaviour
    helps the community to enforce the social norm that protocol
    implementations behave fairly and conform (at least mostly) to the
    specifications. It is important to find new ways of maintaining that
    community trust as increased use of transport header encryption
    limits visibility into transport behaviour (see also [Section
    5.3](#exposing){.xref}).[¶](#section-7-3.12){.pilcrow}
:   

Impact on Benchmarking and Understanding Feature Interactions:
:   An appropriate vantage point for observation, coupled with timing
    information about traffic flows, provides a valuable tool for
    benchmarking network devices, endpoint stacks, and/or
    configurations. This can help understand complex feature
    interactions. An inability to observe transport header information
    can make it harder to diagnose and explore interactions between
    features at different protocol layers, a side effect of not allowing
    a choice of vantage point from which this information is observed.
    New approaches might have to be
    developed.[¶](#section-7-3.14){.pilcrow}
:   

Impact on Research and Development:
:   Hiding transport header information can impede independent research
    into new mechanisms, measurements of behaviour, and development
    initiatives. Experience shows that transport protocols are
    complicated to design and complex to deploy and that individual
    mechanisms have to be evaluated while considering other mechanisms
    across a broad range of network topologies and with attention to the
    impact on traffic sharing the capacity. If increased use of
    transport header encryption results in reduced availability of open
    data, it could eliminate the independent checks to the
    standardisation process that have previously been in place from
    research and academic contributors (e.g., the role of the IRTF
    Internet Congestion Control Research Group (ICCRG) and research
    publications in reviewing new transport mechanisms and assessing the
    impact of their deployment).[¶](#section-7-3.16){.pilcrow}
:   

Observable transport header information might be useful to various
stakeholders. Other sets of stakeholders have incentives to limit what
can be observed. This document does not make recommendations about what
information ought to be exposed, to whom it ought to be observable, or
how this will be achieved. There are also design choices about where
observable fields are placed. For example, one location could be a part
of the transport header outside of the encryption envelope; another
alternative is to carry the information in a network-layer option or
extension header. New transport protocol designs ought to explicitly
identify any fields that are intended to be observed, consider if there
are alternative ways of providing the information, and reflect on the
implications of observable fields being used by on-path network devices
and how this might impact user privacy and protocol evolution when these
fields become ossified.[¶](#section-7-4){.pilcrow}

As \[[RFC7258](#RFC7258){.xref}\] notes, \"Making networks unmanageable
to mitigate PM is not an acceptable outcome, but ignoring PM would go
against the consensus documented here.\" Providing explicit information
can help avoid traffic being inappropriately classified, impacting
application performance. An appropriate balance will emerge over time as
real instances of this tension are analysed
\[[RFC7258](#RFC7258){.xref}\]. This balance between information exposed
and information hidden ought to be carefully considered when specifying
new transport protocols.[¶](#section-7-5){.pilcrow}

## [8.](#section-8){.section-number .selfRef} [Security Considerations](#name-security-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-security-considerations}

This document is about design and deployment considerations for
transport protocols. Issues relating to security are discussed
throughout this document.[¶](#section-8-1){.pilcrow}

Authentication, confidentiality protection, and integrity protection are
identified as transport features by \[[RFC8095](#RFC8095){.xref}\]. As
currently deployed in the Internet, these features are generally
provided by a protocol or layer on top of the transport protocol
\[[RFC8922](#RFC8922){.xref}\].[¶](#section-8-2){.pilcrow}

Confidentiality and strong integrity checks have properties that can
also be incorporated into the design of a transport protocol or to
modify an existing transport. Integrity checks can protect an endpoint
from undetected modification of protocol fields by on-path network
devices, whereas encryption and obfuscation or greasing can further
prevent these headers being utilised by network devices
\[[RFC8701](#RFC8701){.xref}\]. Preventing observation of headers
provides an opportunity for greater freedom to update the protocols and
can ease experimentation with new techniques and their final deployment
in endpoints. A protocol specification needs to weigh the costs of
ossifying common headers versus the potential benefits of exposing
specific information that could be observed along the network path to
provide tools to manage new variants of
protocols.[¶](#section-8-3){.pilcrow}

Header encryption can provide confidentiality of some or all of the
transport header information. This prevents an on-path device from
gaining knowledge of the header field. It therefore prevents mechanisms
being built that directly rely on the information or seeks to infer
semantics of an exposed header field. Reduced visibility into transport
metadata can limit the ability to measure and characterise traffic and
conversely can provide privacy benefits.[¶](#section-8-4){.pilcrow}

Extending the transport payload security context to also include the
transport protocol header protects both types of information with the
same key. A privacy concern would arise if this key was shared with a
third party, e.g., providing access to transport header information to
debug a performance issue would also result in exposing the transport
payload data to the same third party. Such risks would be mitigated
using a layered security design that provides one domain of protection
and associated keys for the transport payload and encrypted transport
headers and a separate domain of protection and associated keys for any
observable transport header fields.[¶](#section-8-5){.pilcrow}

Exposed transport headers are sometimes utilised as a part of the
information to detect anomalies in network traffic. As stated in
\[[RFC7258](#RFC7258){.xref}\], \"While PM is an attack, other forms of
monitoring that might fit the definition of PM can be beneficial and not
part of any attack, e.g., network management functions monitor packets
or flows and anti-spam mechanisms need to see mail message content.\"
This can be used as the first line of defence to identify potential
threats from DoS or malware and redirect suspect traffic to dedicated
nodes responsible for DoS analysis, for malware detection, or to perform
packet \"scrubbing\" (the normalisation of packets so that there are no
ambiguities in interpretation by the ultimate destination of the
packet). These techniques are currently used by some operators to also
defend from distributed DoS attacks.[¶](#section-8-6){.pilcrow}

Exposed transport header fields can also form a part of the information
used by the receiver of a transport protocol to protect the transport
layer from data injection by an attacker. In evaluating this use of
exposed header information, it is important to consider whether it
introduces a significant DoS threat. For example, an attacker could
construct a DoS attack by sending packets with a sequence number that
falls within the currently accepted range of sequence numbers at the
receiving endpoint. This would then introduce additional work at the
receiving endpoint, even though the data in the attacking packet might
not finally be delivered by the transport layer. This is sometimes known
as a \"shadowing attack\". An attack can, for example, disrupt receiver
processing, trigger loss and retransmission, or make a receiving
endpoint perform unproductive decryption of packets that cannot be
successfully decrypted (forcing a receiver to commit decryption
resources, or to update and then restore protocol
state).[¶](#section-8-7){.pilcrow}

One mitigation to off-path attacks is to deny knowledge of what header
information is accepted by a receiver or obfuscate the accepted header
information, e.g., setting a nonpredictable initial value for a sequence
number during a protocol handshake, as in \[[RFC3550](#RFC3550){.xref}\]
and \[[RFC6056](#RFC6056){.xref}\], or a port value that cannot be
predicted (see [Section
5.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8085#section-5.1){.relref} of
\[[RFC8085](#RFC8085){.xref}\]). A receiver could also require
additional information to be used as a part of a validation check before
accepting packets at the transport layer, e.g., utilising a part of the
sequence number space that is encrypted or by verifying an encrypted
token not visible to an attacker. This would also mitigate against
on-path attacks. An additional processing cost can be incurred when
decryption is attempted before a receiver discards an injected
packet.[¶](#section-8-8){.pilcrow}

The existence of open transport protocol standards and a research and
operations community with a history of independent observation and
evaluation of performance data encourage fairness and conformance to
those standards. This suggests careful consideration will be made over
where, and when, measurement samples are collected. An appropriate
balance between encrypting some or all of the transport header
information needs to be considered. Open data and accessibility to tools
that can help understand trends in application deployment, network
traffic, and usage patterns can all contribute to understanding security
challenges.[¶](#section-8-9){.pilcrow}

The security and privacy considerations in \"A Framework for Large-Scale
Measurement of Broadband Performance (LMAP)\"
\[[RFC7594](#RFC7594){.xref}\] contain considerations for Active and
Passive measurement techniques and supporting material on measurement
context.[¶](#section-8-10){.pilcrow}

Addition of observable transport information to the path increases the
information available to an observer and may, when this information can
be linked to a node or user, reduce the privacy of the user. See the
security considerations of
\[[RFC8558](#RFC8558){.xref}\].[¶](#section-8-11){.pilcrow}
