# RFC 8863 {#rfcnum}

# Interactive Connectivity Establishment Patiently Awaiting Connectivity (ICE PAC) {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

During the process of establishing peer-to-peer connectivity,
Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) agents can encounter
situations where they have no candidate pairs to check, and, as a
result, conclude that ICE processing has failed. However, because
additional candidate pairs can be discovered during ICE processing,
declaring failure at this point may be premature. This document
discusses when these situations can
occur.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

This document updates RFCs 8445 and 8838 by requiring that an ICE agent
wait a minimum amount of time before declaring ICE failure, even if
there are no candidate pairs left to
check.[¶](#section-abstract-2){.pilcrow}

## [1.](#section-1){.section-number .selfRef} [Introduction](#name-introduction){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-introduction}

\[[RFC8445](#RFC8445){.xref}\] describes a protocol, Interactive
Connectivity Establishment (ICE), for Network Address Translator (NAT)
traversal for UDP-based communication.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

When using ICE, endpoints will typically exchange ICE candidates, form a
list of candidate pairs, and then test each candidate pair to see if
connectivity can be established. If the test for a given pair fails, it
is marked accordingly, and if all pairs have failed, the overall ICE
process typically is considered to have
failed.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

During the process of connectivity checks, additional candidates may be
created as a result of successful inbound checks from the remote peer.
Such candidates are referred to as peer-reflexive candidates; once
discovered, these candidates will be used to form new candidate pairs,
which will be tested like any other. However, there is an inherent
problem here; if, before learning about any peer-reflexive candidates,
an endpoint runs out of candidate pairs to check, either because it has
none or it considers them all to have failed, it will prematurely
declare failure and terminate ICE processing. This problem can occur in
many common situations.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

This specification updates \[[RFC8445](#RFC8445){.xref}\] and
\[[RFC8838](#RFC8838){.xref}\] by simply requiring that an ICE agent
wait a minimum amount of time before declaring ICE failure, even if
there are no candidate pairs to check or all candidate pairs have
failed. This delay provides enough time for the discovery of
peer-reflexive candidates, which may eventually lead to ICE processing
completing successfully.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-3 .section}
## [3.](#section-3){.section-number .selfRef} [Relevant Scenarios](#name-relevant-scenarios){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-relevant-scenarios}

As noted above, the core problem this specification attempts to address
is the situation where even after local gathering and remote candidate
signaling have completed, the ICE agent immediately ends up with no
valid pairs and no candidate pairs left to check, resulting in a
premature ICE failure. This failure is premature because not enough time
has elapsed to allow for discovery of peer-reflexive candidates from
inbound connectivity checks; if discovered, these candidates are very
likely to result in a valid pair.[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

In most ICE scenarios, the lengthy timeouts for connectivity check
transactions, typically tens of seconds, will prevent this problem from
occurring. However, there are certain specific cases where this problem
will frequently occur.[¶](#section-3-2){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-3.1 .section}
### [3.1.](#section-3.1){.section-number .selfRef} [No Candidates from Peer](#name-no-candidates-from-peer){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-no-candidates-from-peer}

Per \[[RFC8838](#RFC8838){.xref}\], an ICE agent can provide zero
candidates of its own. If the agent somehow knows that the remote
endpoint is directly reachable, gathering local candidates is
unnecessary and will only cause delays; the peer agent can discover the
appropriate local candidate via connectivity
checks.[¶](#section-3.1-1){.pilcrow}

However, following the procedures from \[[RFC8445](#RFC8445){.xref}\]
strictly will result in immediate ICE failure, since the checklist at
the peer agent will be empty.[¶](#section-3.1-2){.pilcrow}

### [3.2.](#section-3.2){.section-number .selfRef} [All Candidates Discarded](#name-all-candidates-discarded){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-all-candidates-discarded}

Even if the ICE agent provides candidates, they may be discarded by the
peer agent if it does not know what to do with them. For example,
candidates may use an address family that the peer agent does not
support (e.g., a host candidate with an IPv6 address in a NAT64
scenario) or that may not be usable for some other
reason.[¶](#section-3.2-1){.pilcrow}

In these scenarios, when the candidates are discarded, the checklist at
the peer agent will once again be empty, leading to immediate ICE
failure.[¶](#section-3.2-2){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-3.3 .section}
### [3.3.](#section-3.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Immediate Candidate Pair Failure](#name-immediate-candidate-pair-fa){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-immediate-candidate-pair-fa}

[Section
7.2.5.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8445#section-7.2.5.2){.relref}
of \[[RFC8445](#RFC8445){.xref}\] describes several situations in which
a candidate pair will be considered to have failed, well before the
connectivity check transaction timeout.[¶](#section-3.3-1){.pilcrow}

As a result, even if the ICE agent provides usable candidates, the pairs
created by the peer agent may fail immediately when checked, e.g., a
check to a non-routable address that receives an immediate ICMP
error.[¶](#section-3.3-2){.pilcrow}

In this situation, the checklist at the peer agent may contain only
failed pairs, resulting in immediate ICE
failure.[¶](#section-3.3-3){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-4 .section}
## [4.](#section-4){.section-number .selfRef} [Update to RFC 8445](#name-update-to-rfc-8445){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-update-to-rfc-8445}

In order to avoid the problem raised by this document, the ICE agent
needs to wait enough time to allow peer-reflexive candidates to be
discovered. Accordingly, when a full ICE implementation begins its ICE
processing, as described in \[[RFC8445](#RFC8445){.xref}\], [Section
6.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8445#section-6.1){.relref}, it
[MUST]{.bcp14} set a timer, henceforth known as the \"PAC timer\"
(Patiently Awaiting Connectivity), to ensure that ICE will run for a
minimum amount of time before determining
failure.[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

Specifically, the ICE agent will start its timer once it believes ICE
connectivity checks are starting. This occurs when the agent has sent
the values needed to perform connectivity checks (e.g., the Username
Fragment and Password denoted in \[[RFC8445](#RFC8445){.xref}\],
[Section
5.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8445#section-5.3){.relref}) and
has received some indication that the remote side is ready to start
connectivity checks, typically via receipt of the values mentioned
above. Note that the agent will start the timer even if it has not sent
or received any ICE candidates.[¶](#section-4-2){.pilcrow}

The [RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14} duration for the PAC timer is equal to the
agent\'s connectivity check transaction timeout, including all
retransmissions. When using default values for retransmission timeout
(RTO) and Rc, this amounts to 39.5 seconds, as explained in
\[[RFC5389](#RFC5389){.xref}\], [Section
7.2.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5389#section-7.2.1){.relref}.
This timeout value is chosen to roughly coincide with the maximum
possible duration of ICE connectivity checks from the remote peer,
which, if successful, could create peer-reflexive candidates. Because
the ICE agent doesn\'t know the exact number of candidate pairs and
pacing interval in use by the remote side, this timeout value is simply
a guess, albeit an educated one. Regardless, for this particular
problem, the desired benefits will be realized as long as the agent
waits some reasonable amount of time, and, as usual, the application is
in the best position to determine what is reasonable for its
scenario.[¶](#section-4-3){.pilcrow}

While the timer is still running, the ICE agent [MUST NOT]{.bcp14}
update a checklist state from Running to Failed, even if there are no
pairs left in the checklist to check. As a result, the ICE agent will
not remove any data streams or set the state of the ICE session to
Failed as long as the timer is running.[¶](#section-4-4){.pilcrow}

When the timer period eventually elapses, the ICE agent [MUST]{.bcp14}
resume typical ICE processing, including setting the state of any
checklists to Failed if they have no pairs left to check and handling
any consequences as indicated in \[[RFC8445](#RFC8445){.xref}\],
[Section
8.1.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8445#section-8.1.2){.relref}.
Naturally, if there are no such checklists, no action is
necessary.[¶](#section-4-5){.pilcrow}

One consequence of this behavior is that in cases where ICE should fail,
e.g., where both sides provide candidates with unsupported address
families, ICE will no longer fail immediately \-- it will only fail when
the PAC timer expires. However, because most ICE scenarios require an
extended period of time to determine failure, the fact that some
specific scenarios no longer fail quickly should have minimal
application impact, if any.[¶](#section-4-6){.pilcrow}

Note also that the PAC timer is potentially relevant to the ICE
nomination procedure described in \[[RFC8445](#RFC8445){.xref}\],
[Section
8.1.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8445#section-8.1.1){.relref}.
That specification does not define a minimum duration for ICE processing
prior to nomination of a candidate pair, but in order to select the best
candidate pair, ICE needs to run for enough time in order to allow
peer-reflexive candidates to be discovered and checked, as noted above.
Accordingly, the controlling ICE agent [SHOULD]{.bcp14} wait a
sufficient amount of time before nominating candidate pairs, and it
[MAY]{.bcp14} use the PAC timer to do so. As always, the controlling ICE
agent retains full discretion and [MAY]{.bcp14} decide, based on its own
criteria, to nominate pairs prior to the PAC timer period
elapsing.[¶](#section-4-7){.pilcrow}

## [5.](#section-5){.section-number .selfRef} [Update to RFC 8838](#name-update-to-rfc-8838){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-update-to-rfc-8838}

Trickle ICE \[[RFC8838](#RFC8838){.xref}\] considers a similar problem,
namely whether an ICE agent should allow a checklist to enter the Failed
state if more candidates might still be provided by the remote peer. The
solution, specified in \[[RFC8838](#RFC8838){.xref}\], [Section
8](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8838#section-8){.relref}, is to
wait until an end-of-candidates indication has been received before
determining ICE failure.[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

However, for the same reasons described above, the ICE agent may
discover peer-reflexive candidates after it has received the
end-of-candidates indication, and so the solution proposed by this
document [MUST]{.bcp14} still be used even when the ICE agent is using
Trickle ICE.[¶](#section-5-2){.pilcrow}

Note also that sending an end-of-candidates indication is only a
[SHOULD]{.bcp14}-strength requirement, which means that ICE agents will
need to implement a backup mechanism to decide when all candidates have
been received, typically a timer. Accordingly, ICE agents [MAY]{.bcp14}
use the PAC timer to also serve as an end-of-candidates
fallback.[¶](#section-5-3){.pilcrow}
