# RFC 8687 {#rfcnum}

# OSPF Routing with Cross-Address Family Traffic Engineering Tunnels {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

When using Traffic Engineering (TE) in a dual-stack IPv4/IPv6 network,
the Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) TE Label Switched Path (LSP)
infrastructure may be duplicated, even if the destination IPv4 and IPv6
addresses belong to the same remote router. In order to achieve an
integrated MPLS TE LSP infrastructure, OSPF routes must be computed over
MPLS TE tunnels created using information propagated in another OSPF
instance. This issue is solved by advertising cross-address family
(X-AF) OSPF TE information.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

This document describes an update to RFC 5786 that allows for the easy
identification of a router\'s local X-AF IP
addresses.[¶](#section-abstract-2){.pilcrow}

TE extensions to [OSPFv2](#RFC3630){.xref}
\[[RFC3630](#RFC3630){.xref}\] and [OSPFv3](#RFC5329){.xref}
\[[RFC5329](#RFC5329){.xref}\] have been described to support intra-area
TE in IPv4 and IPv6 networks, respectively. In both cases, the TE
database provides a tight coupling between the routed protocol and
advertised TE signaling information. In other words, any use of the TE
database is limited to IPv4 for [OSPFv2](#RFC2328){.xref}
\[[RFC2328](#RFC2328){.xref}\] and IPv6 for [OSPFv3](#RFC5340){.xref}
\[[RFC5340](#RFC5340){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

In a dual-stack network, it may be desirable to set up common MPLS TE
LSPs to carry traffic destined to addresses from different address
families on a router. The use of common LSPs eases potential scalability
and management concerns by halving the number of LSPs in the network.
Besides, it allows operators to group traffic based on business
characteristics, class of service, and/or applications; the operators
are not constrained by the network protocol
used.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

For example, an LSP created based on MPLS TE information propagated by
an OSPFv2 instance can be used to transport both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic,
as opposed to using both OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 to provision a separate LSP
for each address family. Even if, in some cases, the
address-family-specific traffic is to be separated, calculation from a
common TE database may prove to be operationally
beneficial.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

During the SPF calculation on the TE tunnel head-end router, OSPF
computes shortcut routes using TE tunnels. A commonly used algorithm for
computing shortcuts is defined in \[[RFC3906](#RFC3906){.xref}\]. For
that or any similar algorithm to work with a common MPLS TE
infrastructure in a dual-stack network, a requirement is to reliably map
the X-AF addresses to the corresponding tail-end router. This mapping is
a challenge because the Link State Advertisements (LSAs) containing the
routing information are carried in one OSPF instance, while the TE
calculations may be done using a TE database from a different OSPF
instance.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

A simple solution to this problem is to rely on the Router ID to
identify a node in the corresponding OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 Link State
Databases (LSDBs). This solution would mandate both instances on the
same router to be configured with the same Router ID. However, relying
on the correctness of configuration puts additional burden and cost on
the operation of the network. The network becomes even more difficult to
manage if OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 topologies do not match exactly, for
example, if area borders are chosen differently in the two protocols.
Also, if the routing processes do fall out of sync (e.g., having
different Router IDs for local administrative reasons), there is no
defined way for other routers to discover such misalignment and to take
corrective measures (such as to avoid routing traffic through affected
TE tunnels or alerting the network administrators). The use of
misaligned Router IDs may result in delivering the traffic to the wrong
tail-end router, which could lead to suboptimal routing or even traffic
loops.[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}

This document describes an update to \[[RFC5786](#RFC5786){.xref}\] that
allows for the easy identification of a router\'s local X-AF IP
addresses. \[[RFC5786](#RFC5786){.xref}\] defined the Node IPv4 Local
Address and Node IPv6 Local Address sub-TLVs of the Node Attribute TLV
for a router to advertise additional local IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
However, \[[RFC5786](#RFC5786){.xref}\] did not describe the
advertisement and usage of these sub-TLVs when the address family of the
advertised local address differed from the address family of the OSPF
traffic engineering protocol.[¶](#section-1-6){.pilcrow}

This document updates \[[RFC5786](#RFC5786){.xref}\] so that a router
can also announce one or more local X-AF addresses using the
corresponding Local Address sub-TLV. Routers using the [Node Attribute
TLV](#RFC5786){.xref} \[[RFC5786](#RFC5786){.xref}\] can include
non-TE-enabled interface addresses in their OSPF TE advertisements and
also use the same sub-TLVs to carry X-AF information, facilitating the
mapping described above.[¶](#section-1-7){.pilcrow}

The method specified in this document can also be used to compute the
X-AF mapping of the egress Label Switching Router (LSR) for sub-LSPs of
a Point-to-Multipoint LSP \[[RFC4461](#RFC4461){.xref}\]. Considerations
of using Point-to-Multipoint MPLS TE for X-AF traffic forwarding is
outside the scope of this document.[¶](#section-1-8){.pilcrow}

## [3.](#section-3){.section-number .selfRef} [Operation](#name-operation){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-operation}

To implement the X-AF routing technique described in this document,
OSPFv2 will advertise the Node IPv6 Local Address sub-TLV and OSPFv3
will advertise the Node IPv4 Local Address sub-TLV, possibly in addition
to advertising other IP addresses as documented by
\[[RFC5786](#RFC5786){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

Multiple instances of OSPFv3 are needed if it is used for both IPv4 and
IPv6 \[[RFC5838](#RFC5838){.xref}\]. The operation in this section is
described with OSPFv2 as the protocol used for IPv4; that is the most
common case. The case of OSPFv3 being used for IPv4 follows the same
procedure as what is indicated for OSPFv2
below.[¶](#section-3-2){.pilcrow}

On a node that implements X-AF routing, each OSPF instance advertises,
using the Node Local Address sub-TLV, all X-AF IPv6 (for OSPFv2
instance) or IPv4 (for OSPFv3) addresses local to the router that can be
used by the Constrained Shortest Path First (CSPF) to calculate MPLS TE
LSPs:[¶](#section-3-3){.pilcrow}

-   [The OSPF instance [MUST]{.bcp14} advertise the IP address listed in
    the Router Address TLV \[[RFC3630](#RFC3630){.xref}\]

    TE database.[¶](#section-3-4.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-4.1}
-   [The OSPF instance [SHOULD]{.bcp14} include additional local
    addresses advertised by the X-AF OSPF instance in its Node Local
    Address sub-TLVs.[¶](#section-3-4.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-4.2}
-   [An implementation [MAY]{.bcp14} advertise other local X-AF
    addresses.[¶](#section-3-4.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-4.3}

When TE information is advertised in an OSPF instance, both natively
(i.e., as per RFC \[[RFC3630](#RFC3630){.xref}\] or
\[[RFC5329](#RFC5329){.xref}\]) and as X-AF Node Attribute TLV, it is
left to local configuration to determine which TE database is used to
compute routes for the OSPF instance.[¶](#section-3-5){.pilcrow}

On Area Border Routers (ABRs), each advertised X-AF IP address
[MUST]{.bcp14} be advertised into, at most, one area. If OSPFv2 and
OSPFv3 ABRs coincide (i.e., the areas for all OSPFv2 and OSPFv3
interfaces are the same), then the X-AF addresses [MUST]{.bcp14} be
advertised into the same area in both instances. This allows other ABRs
connected to the same set of areas to know with which area to associate
computed MPLS TE tunnels.[¶](#section-3-6){.pilcrow}

During the X-AF routing calculation, X-AF IP addresses are used to map
locally created LSPs to tail-end routers in the LSDB. The mapping
algorithm can be described as:[¶](#section-3-7){.pilcrow}

-   [Walk the list of all MPLS TE tunnels for which the computing router

        apply.[¶](#section-3-8.2.1.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-8.2.1.1}
    2.  [Otherwise, it is a X-AF MPLS TE tunnel. Note the tunnel\'s

    3.  [Walk the X-AF IP addresses in the LSDBs of all connected areas.
        If a matching IP address is found, advertised by router R in
        area A, then mark the tunnel T as belonging to area A and
        terminating on tail-end router R. Assign the intra-area SPF cost
        to reach router R within area A as the IGP cost of tunnel
        T.[¶](#section-3-8.2.1.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-8.2.1.3}
    :::

After completing this calculation, each TE tunnel is associated with an
area and tail-end router in terms of the routing LSDB of the computing
OSPF instance and has a cost.[¶](#section-3-9){.pilcrow}

The algorithm described above is to be used only if the Node Local
Address sub-TLV includes X-AF information.[¶](#section-3-10){.pilcrow}

Note that, for clarity of description, the mapping algorithm is
specified as a single calculation. Implementations may choose to support
equivalent mapping functionality without implementing the algorithm as
described.[¶](#section-3-11){.pilcrow}

As an example, consider a router in a dual-stack network using OSPFv2
and OSPFv3 for IPv4 and IPv6 routing, respectively. Suppose the OSPFv2
instance is used to propagate MPLS TE information and the router is
configured to accept TE LSPs terminating at local addresses 198.51.100.1
and 198.51.100.2. The router advertises in OSPFv2 the IPv4 address
198.51.100.1 in the Router Address TLV, the additional local IPv4
address 198.51.100.2 in the Node IPv4 Local Address sub-TLV, and other
TE TLVs as required by \[[RFC3630](#RFC3630){.xref}\]. If the OSPFv3
instance in the network is enabled for X-AF TE routing (that is, to use
MPLS TE LSPs computed by OSPFv2 for IPv6 routing), then the OSPFv3
instance of the router will advertise the Node IPv4 Local Address
sub-TLV listing the local IPv4 addresses 198.51.100.1 and 198.51.100.2.
Other routers in the OSPFv3 network will use this information to
reliably identify this router as the egress LSR for MPLS TE LSPs
terminating at either 198.51.100.1 or
198.51.100.2.[¶](#section-3-12){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC6827](#RFC6827){.xref}\] updates \[[RFC5786](#RFC5786){.xref}\] by
defining extensions to be used in an Automatically Switched Optical
Network (ASON). The Local TE Router ID sub-TLV is required for
determining ASON reachability. The implication is that if the Local TE
Router ID sub-TLV is present in the Node Attribute TLV, then the
procedures in \[[RFC6827](#RFC6827){.xref}\] apply, regardless of
whether any X-AF information is advertised.[¶](#section-4.1-1){.pilcrow}

This document describes the use of the Local Address sub-TLVs to provide
X-AF information. The advertisement of these sub-TLVs, in any OSPF
instance, is not precluded by \[[RFC5786](#RFC5786){.xref}\]. As such,
no new security threats are introduced beyond the considerations in
[OSPFv2](#RFC2328){.xref} \[[RFC2328](#RFC2328){.xref}\],
[OSPFv3](#RFC5340){.xref} \[[RFC5340](#RFC5340){.xref}\], and
\[[RFC5786](#RFC5786){.xref}\].[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

The X-AF information is not used for SPF computation or normal routing,
so the mechanism specified here has no effect on IP routing. However,
generating incorrect information or tampering with the sub-TLVs may have
an effect on traffic engineering computations. Specifically, TE traffic
may be delivered to the wrong tail-end router, which could lead to
suboptimal routing, traffic loops, or exposing the traffic to attacker
inspection or modification. These threats are already present in other
TE-related specifications, and their considerations apply here as well,
including \[[RFC3630](#RFC3630){.xref}\] and
