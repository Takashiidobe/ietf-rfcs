# RFC 8806 {#rfcnum}

# Running a Root Server Local to a Resolver {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

Some DNS recursive resolvers have longer-than-desired round-trip times
to the closest DNS root server; those resolvers may have difficulty
getting responses from the root servers, such as during a network
attack. Some DNS recursive resolver operators want to prevent snooping
by third parties of requests sent to DNS root servers. In both cases,
resolvers can greatly decrease the round-trip time and prevent
observation of requests by serving a copy of the full root zone on the
same server, such as on a loopback address or in the resolver software.
This document shows how to start and maintain such a copy of the root
zone that does not cause problems for other users of the DNS, at the
cost of adding some operational fragility for the
operator.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

DNS recursive resolvers have to provide answers to all queries from
their clients, even those for domain names that do not exist. For each
queried name that is within a top-level domain (TLD) that is not in the
recursive resolver\'s cache, the resolver must send a query to a root
server to get the information for that TLD or to find out that the TLD
does not exist. Research shows that the vast majority of queries going
to the root are for names that do not exist in the root
zone.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

Many of the queries from recursive resolvers to root servers get answers
that are referrals to other servers. Malicious third parties might be
able to observe that traffic on the network between the recursive
resolver and root servers.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

The primary goals of this design are to provide more reliable answers
for queries to the root zone during network attacks that affect the root
servers and to prevent queries and responses from being visible on the
network. This design will probably have little effect on getting faster
responses to the stub resolver for good queries on TLDs, because the TTL
for most TLDs is usually long-lived (on the order of a day or two) and
is thus usually already in the cache of the recursive resolver; the same
is true for the TTL for negative answers from the root servers.
(Although the primary goal of the design is for serving the root zone,
the method can be used for any zone.)[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

This document describes a method for the operator of a recursive
resolver to have a complete root zone locally and to hide queries for
the root zone from outsiders. The basic idea is to create an up-to-date
root zone service on the same host as the recursive server and use that
service when the recursive resolver looks up root information. The
recursive resolver validates all responses from the root service on the
same host, just as it would validate all responses from a remote root
server.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

This design explicitly only allows the new root zone service to be run
on the same server as the recursive resolver in order to prevent the
server from serving authoritative answers to any other system.
Specifically, the root service on the local system [MUST]{.bcp14} be
configured to only answer queries from resolvers on the same host and
[MUST NOT]{.bcp14} answer queries from any other
resolver.[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}

At the time that [RFC 7706](#RFC7706){.xref}
\[[RFC7706](#RFC7706){.xref}\] was published, it was considered
controversial, because there was not consensus on whether this was a
\"best practice\". In fact, many people felt that it is an excessively
risky practice, because it introduced a new operational piece to local
DNS operations where there was not one before. Since then, the DNS
operational community has largely shifted to believing that local
serving of the root zone for an individual resolver is a reasonable
practice. The advantages listed above do not come free: if this new
system does not work correctly, users can get bad data, or the entire
recursive resolution system might fail in ways that are hard to
diagnose.[¶](#section-1-6){.pilcrow}

This design uses an authoritative service running on the same machine as
the recursive resolver. Common open source recursive resolver software
does not need to add new functionality to act as an authoritative server
for some zones, but other recursive resolver software might need to be
able to talk to an authoritative server running on the same host. Some
resolver software supports being both an authoritative server and a
resolver but separated by logical \"views\", allowing a local root to be
implemented within a single process; examples of this can be seen in
[Appendix B](#examples){.xref}.[¶](#section-1-7){.pilcrow}

A different approach to solving some of the problems discussed in this
document is described in
\[[RFC8198](#RFC8198){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-8){.pilcrow}

Readers are expected to be familiar with
\[[RFC8499](#RFC8499){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-9){.pilcrow}

### [1.1.](#section-1.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Changes from RFC 7706](#name-changes-from-rfc-7706){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-changes-from-rfc-7706}

RFC 7706 explicitly required that a root server instance be run on the
loopback interface of the host running the validating resolver. However,
RFC 7706 also had examples of how to set up common software that did not
use the loopback interface. This document loosens the restriction on
using the loopback interface and in fact allows the use of a local
service, not necessarily an authoritative server. However, the document
keeps the requirement that only systems running on that single host be
able to query that authoritative root server or
service.[¶](#section-1.1-1){.pilcrow}

This document changes the use cases for running a local root service to
be more consistent with the reasons operators said they had for using
RFC 7706:[¶](#section-1.1-2){.pilcrow}

-   [Removed the prohibition on distribution of recursive DNS servers,
    including configurations for this design because some already do and
    others have expressed an interest in doing
    so.[¶](#section-1.1-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-1.1-3.1}
-   [Added the idea that a recursive resolver using this design might
    switch to using the normal (remote) root servers if the local root
    server fails.[¶](#section-1.1-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-1.1-3.2}
-   [Refreshed the list of where one can get copies of the root
    zone.[¶](#section-1.1-3.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-1.1-3.3}

In order to implement the mechanism described in this
document:[¶](#section-2-1){.pilcrow}

-   [The system [MUST]{.bcp14} be able to validate every signed record
    in a zone with DNSSEC
    \[[RFC4033](#RFC4033){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-2-2.1}
-   [The system [MUST]{.bcp14} have an up-to-date copy of the public
    part of the Key Signing Key (KSK) \[[RFC4033](#RFC4033){.xref}\]
    used to sign the DNS
    root.[¶](#section-2-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-2-2.2}
-   [The system [MUST]{.bcp14} be able to retrieve a copy of the entire
    root zone (including all DNSSEC-related
    records).[¶](#section-2-2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-2-2.3}
-   [The system [MUST]{.bcp14} be able to run an authoritative service
    for the root zone on the same host. The authoritative root service
    [MUST]{.bcp14} only respond to queries from the same host. One way
    to ensure that the authoritative root service does not respond to
    queries from other hosts is to run an authoritative server for the
    root that responds only on one of the loopback addresses (that is,
    an address in the range 127/8 for IPv4 or ::1 in IPv6). Another
    method is to have the resolver software also act as an authoritative
    server for the root zone, but only for answering queries from
    itself.[¶](#section-2-2.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-2-2.4}

A corollary of the above list is that authoritative data in the root
zone used on the local authoritative server [MUST]{.bcp14} be identical
to the same data in the root zone for the DNS. It is possible to change
the unsigned data (the glue records) in the copy of the root zone, but
such changes could cause problems for the recursive server that accesses
the local root zone, and therefore any changes to the glue records
[SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} be made.[¶](#section-2-3){.pilcrow}

## [3.](#section-3){.section-number .selfRef} [Operation of the Root Zone on the Local Server](#name-operation-of-the-root-zone-){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-operation-of-the-root-zone-}

The operation of an authoritative server for the root in the system
described here can be done separately from the operation of the
recursive resolver, or it might be part of the configuration of the
recursive resolver system.[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

The steps to set up the root zone are:[¶](#section-3-2){.pilcrow}

1.  [Retrieve a copy of the root zone. (See [Appendix
    A](#sources){.xref} for some current locations of
    sources.)[¶](#section-3-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-3.1}
2.  [Start the authoritative service for the root zone in a manner that
    prevents any system other than a recursive resolver on the same host
    from accessing it.[¶](#section-3-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-3.2}

The contents of the root zone [MUST]{.bcp14} be refreshed using the
timers from the SOA record in the root zone, as described in
\[[RFC1035](#RFC1035){.xref}\]. This inherently means that the contents
of the local root zone will likely be a little behind those of the
global root servers, because those servers are updated when triggered by
NOTIFY messages.[¶](#section-3-4){.pilcrow}

There is a risk that a system using a local authoritative server for the
root zone cannot refresh the contents of the root zone before the expire
time in the SOA. A system using a local authoritative server for the
root zone [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} serve stale data for the root zone. To
mitigate the risk that stale data is served, the local root server
[MUST]{.bcp14} immediately switch to using non-local root servers when
it detects that it would be serving state
data.[¶](#section-3-5){.pilcrow}

In a resolver that is using an internal service for the root zone, if
the contents of the root zone cannot be refreshed before the expire time
in the SOA, the resolver [MUST]{.bcp14} immediately switch to using
non-local root servers.[¶](#section-3-6){.pilcrow}

In the event that refreshing the contents of the root zone fails, the
results can be disastrous. For example, sometimes all the NS records for
a TLD are changed in a short period of time (such as 2 days); if the
refreshing of the local root zone is broken during that time, the
recursive resolver will have bad data for the entire TLD
zone.[¶](#section-3-7){.pilcrow}

An administrator using the procedure in this document [SHOULD]{.bcp14}
have an automated method to check that the contents of the local root
zone are being refreshed; this might be part of the resolver software.
One way to do this is to have a separate process that periodically
checks the SOA of the local root zone and makes sure that it is
changing. At the time that this document is published, the SOA for the
root zone is the digital representation of the current date with a
two-digit counter appended, and the SOA is changed every day even if the
contents of the root zone are unchanged. For example, the SOA of the
root zone on January 2, 2019 was 2019010201. A process can use this fact
to create a check for the contents of the local root zone (using a
program not specified in this document).[¶](#section-3-8){.pilcrow}

## [4.](#section-4){.section-number .selfRef} [Security Considerations](#name-security-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-security-considerations}

A system that does not follow the DNSSEC-related requirements given in
[Section 2](#reqs){.xref} can be fooled into giving bad responses in the
same way as any recursive resolver that does not do DNSSEC validation on
responses from a remote root server. Anyone deploying the method
described in this document should be familiar with the operational
benefits and costs of deploying DNSSEC
\[[RFC4033](#RFC4033){.xref}\].[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

As stated in [Section 1](#intro){.xref}, this design explicitly requires
the local copy of the root zone information to be available only from
resolvers on that host. This has the security property of limiting
damage to clients of any local resolver that might try to rely on an
altered copy of the root.[¶](#section-4-2){.pilcrow}

## [Appendix A.](#section-appendix.a){.section-number .selfRef} [Current Sources of the Root Zone](#name-current-sources-of-the-root){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-current-sources-of-the-root}

The root zone can be retrieved from anywhere as long as it comes with
all the DNSSEC records needed for validation. Currently, one can get the
root zone from ICANN by zone transfer AXFR
\[[RFC5936](#RFC5936){.xref}\] over TCP from DNS servers at
xfr.lax.dns.icann.org and xfr.cjr.dns.icann.org. The root zone file can
be obtained using methods described at
\<<https://www.iana.org/domains/root/files>\>.[¶](#section-appendix.a-1){.pilcrow}

Currently, the root can also be retrieved by AXFR over TCP from the
following root server operators:[¶](#section-appendix.a-2){.pilcrow}

-   [b.root-servers.net[¶](#section-appendix.a-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-appendix.a-3.1}
-   [c.root-servers.net[¶](#section-appendix.a-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-appendix.a-3.2}
-   [d.root-servers.net[¶](#section-appendix.a-3.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-appendix.a-3.3}
-   [f.root-servers.net[¶](#section-appendix.a-3.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-appendix.a-3.4}
-   [g.root-servers.net[¶](#section-appendix.a-3.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-appendix.a-3.5}
-   [k.root-servers.net[¶](#section-appendix.a-3.6){.pilcrow}]{#section-appendix.a-3.6}

It is crucial to note that none of the above services are guaranteed to
be available. It is possible that ICANN or some of the root server
operators will turn off the AXFR capability on the servers listed above.
Using AXFR over TCP to addresses that are likely to be anycast (as the
ones above are) may conceivably have transfer problems due to anycast,
but current practice shows that to be
unlikely.[¶](#section-appendix.a-4){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-a.1 .section}
## [A.1.](#section-a.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Root Zone Services](#name-root-zone-services){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-root-zone-services}

At the time that this document is published, there is one root zone
service that is active and one that has been announced as in the
planning stages. This section describes all known active
services.[¶](#section-a.1-1){.pilcrow}

LocalRoot (\<<https://localroot.isi.edu/>\>) is an experimental service
that embodies many of the ideas in this document. It distributes the
root zone by AXFR and also offers DNS NOTIFY messages when the LocalRoot
system sees that the root zone has changed.[¶](#section-a.1-2){.pilcrow}

## [Appendix B.](#section-appendix.b){.section-number .selfRef} [Example Configurations of Common Implementations](#name-example-configurations-of-c){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-example-configurations-of-c}

This section shows fragments of configurations for some popular
recursive server software that is believed to correctly implement the
requirements given in this document. The examples have been updated
since the publication of
\[[RFC7706](#RFC7706){.xref}\].[¶](#section-appendix.b-1){.pilcrow}

The IPv4 and IPv6 addresses in this section were checked in March 2020
by testing for AXFR over TCP from each address for the known
single-letter names in the root-servers.net
zone.[¶](#section-appendix.b-2){.pilcrow}

## [B.1.](#section-b.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Example Configuration: BIND 9.12](#name-example-configuration-bind-){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-example-configuration-bind-}

BIND 9.12 acts both as a recursive resolver and an authoritative server.
Because of this, there is \"fate-sharing\" between the two servers in
the following configuration. That is, if the root server dies, it is
likely that all of BIND is dead.[¶](#section-b.1-1){.pilcrow}

Note that a future version of BIND will support a much more robust
method for creating a local mirror of the root or other zones; see
[Appendix B.3](#bind-9-14){.xref}.[¶](#section-b.1-2){.pilcrow}

Using this configuration, queries for information in the root zone are
returned with the Authoritative Answer (AA) bit not
set.[¶](#section-b.1-3){.pilcrow}

When slaving a zone, BIND 9.12 will treat zone data differently if the
zone is slaved into a separate view (or a separate instance of the
software) versus slaved into the same view or instance that is also
performing the recursion.[¶](#section-b.1-4){.pilcrow}

Validation:
:   When using separate views or separate instances, the DS records in
    the slaved zone will be validated as the zone data is accessed by
    the recursive server. When using the same view, this validation does
    not occur for the slaved zone.[¶](#section-b.1-5.2){.pilcrow}
:   

Caching:
:   When using separate views or instances, the recursive server will
    cache all of the queries for the slaved zone, just as it would using
    the traditional \"root hints\" method. Thus, as the zone in the
    other view or instance is refreshed or updated, changed information
    will not appear in the recursive server until the TTL of the old
    record times out. Currently, the TTL for DS and delegation NS
    records is two days. When using the same view, all zone data in the
    recursive server will be updated as soon as it receives its copy of
    the zone.[¶](#section-b.1-5.4){.pilcrow}

BIND 9.14 can set up a local mirror of the root zone with a small
configuration option:[¶](#section-b.3-1){.pilcrow}

[¶](#section-b.3-2){.pilcrow}

The simple \"type mirror\" configuration for the root zone works for the
root zone because a default list of primary servers for the IANA root
zone is built into BIND 9.14. In order to set up mirroring of any other
zone, an explicit list of primary servers needs to be
provided.[¶](#section-b.3-3){.pilcrow}

Windows Server 2012 contains a DNS server in the \"DNS Manager\"
component. When activated, that component acts as a recursive server.
The DNS Manager can also act as an authoritative
server.[¶](#section-b.6-1){.pilcrow}

The steps to configure the DNS Manager to implement the requirements in
this document are:[¶](#section-b.6-3){.pilcrow}

1.  [Launch the DNS Manager GUI. This can be done from the command line
    (\"dnsmgmt.msc\") or from the Service Manager (the \"DNS\" command
    in the \"Tools\"
    menu).[¶](#section-b.6-4.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-b.6-4.1}
2.  [In the hierarchy under the server on which the service is running,
    right-click on the \"Forward Lookup Zones\", and select \"New
    Zone\". This brings up a succession of dialog
    boxes.[¶](#section-b.6-4.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-b.6-4.2}
3.  [In the \"Zone Type\" dialog box, select \"Secondary
    zone\".[¶](#section-b.6-4.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-b.6-4.3}
4.  [In the \"Zone Name\" dialog box, enter
    \".\".[¶](#section-b.6-4.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-b.6-4.4}
5.  [In the \"Master DNS Servers\" dialog box, enter
    \"b.root‑servers.net\". The system validates that it can do a zone
    transfer from that server. (After this configuration is completed,
    the DNS Manager will attempt to transfer from all of the root zone
    servers.)[¶](#section-b.6-4.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-b.6-4.5}
6.  [In the \"Completing the New Zone Wizard\" dialog box, click
    \"Finish\".[¶](#section-b.6-4.6){.pilcrow}]{#section-b.6-4.6}
7.  [Verify that the DNS Manager is acting as a recursive resolver.
    Right-click on the server name in the hierarchy, choosing the
    \"Advanced\" tab in the dialog box. See that \"Disable recursion
    (also disables forwarders)\" is not selected and that \"Enable
    DNSSEC validation for remote responses\" is
    selected.[¶](#section-b.6-4.7){.pilcrow}]{#section-b.6-4.7}
