# Test Cases for Evaluating Congestion Control for Interactive Real-Time Media {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is used to transmit media in
multimedia telephony applications. These applications are typically
required to implement congestion control. This document describes the
test cases to be used in the performance evaluation of such congestion
control algorithms in a controlled
environment.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

This memo describes a set of test cases for evaluating congestion
control algorithm proposals in controlled environments for real-time
interactive media. It is based on the guidelines enumerated in
\[[RFC8868](#RFC8868){.xref}\] and the requirements discussed in
\[[RFC8836](#RFC8836){.xref}\]. The test cases cover basic usage
scenarios and are described using a common structure, which allows for
additional test cases to be added to those described herein to
accommodate other topologies and/or the modeling of different path
characteristics. The described test cases in this memo should be used to
evaluate any proposed congestion control algorithm for real-time
interactive media.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

All the test cases in this document follow a basic structure allowing
implementers to describe a new test scenario without repeatedly
explaining common attributes. The structure includes a general
description section that describes the test case and its motivation.
Additionally the test case defines a set of attributes that characterize
the testbed, for example, the network path between communicating peers
and the diverse traffic sources.[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

        behavior.[¶](#section-3-2.2.2.4){.pilcrow}

    List of metrics to evaluate the desired behavior:
    :   this indicates the minimum set of metrics (e.g., link
        utilization, media sending rate) that a proposed algorithm needs
        to measure to validate the expected rate adaptation behavior. It
        should also indicate the time granularity (e.g., averaged over
        10 ms, 100 ms, or 1 s) for measuring certain metrics. Typical
        measurement interval is 200 ms.[¶](#section-3-2.2.2.6){.pilcrow}
    :   

:   

Define testbed topology:

:   \

    Every test case needs to define an evaluation testbed topology.
    [Figure 1](#fig-eval-topo){.xref} shows such an evaluation topology.
    In this evaluation topology, S1..Sn are traffic sources. These
    sources generate media traffic and use the congestion control
    algorithm(s) under investigation. R1..Rn are the corresponding
    receivers. A test case can have one or more such traffic sources (S)
    and their corresponding receivers (R). The path from the source to
    destination is denoted as \"forward\", and the path from a
    destination to a source is denoted as \"backward\". The following
    basic structure of the test case has been described from the
    perspective of media-generating endpoints attached on the left-hand
    side of [Figure 1](#fig-eval-topo){.xref}. In this setup, the media
    flows are transported in the forward direction, and the
    corresponding feedback/control messages are transported in the
    backward direction. However, it is also possible to set up the test
    with media in both forward and backward directions. In that case,
    unless otherwise specified by the test case, it is expected that the
    backward path does not introduce any congestion-related impairments
    and has enough capacity to accommodate both media and
    feedback/control messages. It should be noted that, depending on the
    test cases, it is possible to have different path characteristics in
    either of the directions.[¶](#section-3-2.4.2){.pilcrow}

    In a testbed environment with real equipment, there may exist a
    significant amount of unwanted traffic on the portions of the
    network path between the endpoints. Some of this traffic may be
    generated by other processes on the endpoints themselves (e.g.,
    discovery protocols) or by other endpoints not presently under test.
    Such unwanted traffic should be removed or avoided to the greatest
    extent possible.[¶](#section-3-2.4.4){.pilcrow}

    oscillations might occur when the media flow(s) attempts to reach
    its maximum bit rate but overshoots the usage of the available

Real-time interactive media uses RTP; hence it is assumed that RTCP, RTP
header extension, or such would be used by the congestion control
algorithm in the back channel. Due to the asymmetric nature of the link
between communicating peers, it is possible for a participating peer to
not receive such feedback information due to an impaired or congested
back channel (even when the forward channel might not be impaired). This
test case is designed to observe the candidate congestion control
behavior in such an event.[¶](#section-5.3-1){.pilcrow}

In this test case, more than one media flow share the bottleneck link,
and each of them uses the same congestion control algorithm. This is a
typical scenario where a real-time interactive application sends more
than one media flow to the same destination, and these flows are
multiplexed over the same port. In such a scenario, it is likely that
the flows will be routed via the same path and need to share the
available bandwidth amongst themselves. For the sake of simplicity, it
is assumed that there are no other competing traffic sources in the
bottleneck link and that there is sufficient capacity to accommodate all
the flows individually. While this appears to be a variant of the test
case defined in [Section 5.2](#VACM){.xref}, it focuses on the
capacity-sharing aspect of the candidate algorithm. The previous test
case, on the other hand, measures adaptability, stability, and
responsiveness of the candidate algorithm.[¶](#section-5.4-1){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

Expected behavior:
:   It is expected that the competing flows will converge to an optimum
    bit rate to accommodate all the flows with minimum possible latency
    and loss. Specifically, the test introduces three media flows at
    different time instances. When the second flow appears, there should
    still be room to accommodate another flow on the bottleneck link.
    Lastly, when the third flow appears, the bottleneck link should be
    saturated.[¶](#section-5.4-2.2){.pilcrow}

In this test case, multiple media flows share the bottleneck link, but
the one-way propagation delay for each flow is different. For the sake
of simplicity, it is assumed that there are no other competing traffic
sources in the bottleneck link and that there is sufficient capacity to
accommodate all the flows. While this appears to be a variant of test
case 5.2 ([Section 5.2](#VACM){.xref}), it focuses on the
capacity-sharing aspect of the candidate algorithm under different
RTTs.[¶](#section-5.5-1){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

Expected behavior:
:   It is expected that the competing flows will converge to bit rates
    to accommodate all the flows with minimum possible latency and loss.
    The effectiveness of the algorithm depends on how fast and fairly
    the competing flows converge to their steady states irrespective of
    the RTT observed.[¶](#section-5.5-2.2){.pilcrow}

In this test case, one or more media flows share the bottleneck link
with at least one long-lived TCP flow. Long-lived TCP flows download
data throughout the session and are expected to have infinite amount of
data to send and receive. This is a scenario where a multimedia
application coexists with a large file download. The test case measures
the adaptivity of the candidate algorithm to competing traffic. It
addresses requirement 3 in [Section

In this test case, one or more congestion-controlled media flows share
the bottleneck link with multiple short-lived TCP flows. Short-lived TCP
flows resemble the on/off pattern observed in web traffic, wherein
clients (for example, browsers) connect to a server and download a
resource (typically a web page, few images, text files, etc.) using
several TCP connections. This scenario shows the performance of a
multimedia application when several browser windows are active. The test
case measures the adaptivity of the candidate algorithm to competing web
traffic, and it addresses requirement 1.E in [Section
2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8836#section-2){.relref} of
\[[RFC8836](#RFC8836){.xref}\].[¶](#section-5.7-1){.pilcrow}

Depending on the number of short TCP flows, the cross traffic either
appears as a short burst flow or resembles a long-lived TCP flow. The
intention of this test is to observe the impact of a short-term burst on
the behavior of the candidate algorithm.[¶](#section-5.7-2){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

Expected behavior:
:   The candidate algorithm is expected to avoid flow starvation during
    the presence of short and bursty competing TCP flows, streaming at
    least at the minimum media bit rate. After competing TCP flows
    terminate, the media streams are expected to be robust enough to
    eventually recover to previous steady state behavior, and at the
    very least, avoid persistent
    starvation.[¶](#section-5.7-3.2){.pilcrow}

### [5.8.](#section-5.8){.section-number .selfRef} [Media Pause and Resume](#name-media-pause-and-resume){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-media-pause-and-resume}

In this test case, more than one real-time interactive media flow share
the link bandwidth, and all flows reach to a steady state by utilizing
the link capacity in an optimum way. At this stage, one of the media
flows is paused for a moment. This event will result in more available
bandwidth for the rest of the flows as they are on a shared link. When
the paused media flow resumes, it no longer has the same bandwidth share
on the link. It has to make its way through the other existing flows in
the link to achieve a fair share of the link capacity. This test case is
important specially for real-time interactive media, which consists of
more than one media flows and can pause/resume media flows at any point
of time during the session. This test case directly addresses
requirement 5 in [Section
2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8836#section-2){.relref} of
\[[RFC8836](#RFC8836){.xref}\]. One can think of it as a variation of
the test case defined in [Section 5.4](#competing-rmcat-flow){.xref}.
However, it is different as the candidate algorithms can use different
strategies to increase efficiency, for example, in terms of fairness,
convergence time, oscillation reduction, etc., by capitalizing on the
fact that they have previous information of the
link.[¶](#section-5.8-1){.pilcrow}

Expected behavior:
:   During the period where the third stream is paused, the two
    remaining flows are expected to increase their rates and reach the
    maximum media bit rate. When the third stream resumes, all three
    flows are expected to converge to the same original fair share of
    rates prior to the media pause/resume

In this test case, media flows will have different priority levels. This
is an extension of [Section 5.4](#competing-rmcat-flow){.xref} where the
same test is run with different priority levels imposed on each of the
media flows. For example, the first flow (S1) is assigned a priority of
2, whereas the remaining two flows (S2 and S3) are assigned a priority
of 1. The candidate algorithm must reflect the relative priorities
assigned to each media flow. In this case, the first flow (S1) must
arrive at a steady-state rate approximately twice that of the other two
flows (S2 and S3).[¶](#section-6.1-1){.pilcrow}

The candidate algorithm can use a coupled congestion control mechanism

In this test case, one congestion-controlled media flow, S1-\>R1,
traverses a path with multiple bottlenecks. As illustrated in [Figure

the second congestion-controlled media flow (S2-\>R2) over the link
between A and B, which is close to the sender side. Again, that flow
(S1-\>R1) competes with the third congestion-controlled media flow
(S3-\>R3) over the link between C and D, which is close to the receiver
side. The goal of this test is to ensure that the candidate algorithms
work properly in the presence of multiple bottleneck links on the
end-to-end path.[¶](#section-6.3-1){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC8868](#RFC8868){.xref}\] and the relevant congestion control
algorithms apply. The principles for congestion control are described in
\[[RFC2914](#RFC2914){.xref}\], and in particular any new method must
implement safeguards to avoid congestion collapse of the
Internet.[¶](#section-8-1){.pilcrow}

The evaluation of the test cases are intended to be run in a controlled
lab environment. Hence, the applications, simulators, and network nodes
ought to be well-behaved and should not impact the desired results.
Moreover, proper measures must be taken to avoid leaking nonresponsive
traffic from unproven congestion avoidance techniques onto the open
Internet.[¶](#section-8-2){.pilcrow}
