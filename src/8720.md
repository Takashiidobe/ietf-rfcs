## [1.](#section-1){.section-number .selfRef} [Introduction](#name-introduction){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-introduction}

The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and its predecessors have
traditionally separated the publication of protocol specifications in
immutable Request for Comments (RFCs) and the registries containing
protocol parameters. Traditionally, the registries are maintained by a
set of functions known collectively as the Internet Assigned Numbers
Authority (IANA). Dating back to the earliest days of the Internet,
specification publication and the registry operations were tightly
coupled: Jon Postel of the Information Sciences Institute (ISI) of the
University of Southern California (USC) was responsible for both RFC
publication and IANA registry operation. This tight coupling had
advantages, but it was never a requirement. Indeed, today, the RFC
Editor and IANA registry operation are provided by different
entities.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

Internet registries are critical to the operation of the Internet
because they provide a definitive record of the value and meaning of
identifiers that protocols use when communicating with each other.
Almost every Internet protocol makes use of registries in some form. At
the time of writing, the IANA maintains more than two thousand protocol
parameter registries.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

Internet registries hold protocol identifiers consisting of constants
and other well-known values used by Internet protocols. These values can
be numbers, strings, addresses, and so on. They are uniquely assigned
for one particular purpose or use. Identifiers can be maintained in a
central list (such as a list of cryptographic algorithms), or they can
be hierarchically allocated and assigned by separate entities at
different points in the hierarchy (such as IP addresses and domain
names). To maximize trust and usefulness of the IANA registries, the
principles in this document should be taken into consideration for
centralized registries as well as hierarchically delegated registries.
In hierarchically delegated registries, entries nearest to top level
have broad scope, but lower-level entries have narrow scope. The
Internet Architecture Board (IAB) will encourage support for these
principles in all delegations of Internet
identifiers.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

The registry system is built on trust and mutual cooperation. The use of
the registries is voluntary and is not enforced by mandates or
certification policies. While the use of registries is voluntary, it is
noted that the success of the Internet creates enormous pressure to use
Internet protocols and the identifier registries associated with
them.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

This document provides principles for the operation of IANA registries,
ensuring that protocol identifiers have consistent meanings and
interpretations across all implementations and deployments, thus
providing the necessary trust in the IANA
registries.[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}

## [2.](#section-2){.section-number .selfRef} [Principles for the Operation of IANA Registries](#name-principles-for-the-operatio){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-principles-for-the-operatio}

The following key principles underscore the successful functioning of
the IANA registries, and they provide a foundation for trust in those
registries:[¶](#section-2-1){.pilcrow}

Ensure Uniqueness:
:   The same protocol identifier must not be used for more than one
    purpose.[¶](#section-2-2.2){.pilcrow}

Stable:
:   Protocol identifier assignment must be
    lasting.[¶](#section-2-2.4){.pilcrow}

Predictable:
:   The process for making assignments must not include unexpected
    steps.[¶](#section-2-2.6){.pilcrow}

Public:
:   The protocol identifiers must be made available in well-known
    locations in a manner that makes them freely available to
    everyone.[¶](#section-2-2.8){.pilcrow}

Open:
:   The process that sets the policy for protocol identifier assignment
    and registration must be open to all interested
    parties.[¶](#section-2-2.10){.pilcrow}

Transparent:
:   The protocol registries and their associated policies should be
    developed in a transparent manner.[¶](#section-2-2.12){.pilcrow}

Accountable:
:   Registry policy development and registry operations need to be
    accountable to the affected community.[¶](#section-2-2.14){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-3 .section}
## [3.](#section-3){.section-number .selfRef} [Discussion](#name-discussion){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-discussion}

The principles discussed in [Section 2](#sect-2){.xref} provide trust
and confidence in the IANA registries. This section expands on these
principles.[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

::: {#sect-3.1}
::: {#section-3.1 .section}
### [3.1.](#section-3.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Ensuring Uniqueness, Stability, and Predictability](#name-ensuring-uniqueness-stabili){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-ensuring-uniqueness-stabili}

Protocol identifier assignment and registration must be unique, stable,
and predictable. Developers, vendors, customers, and users depend on the
registries for unique protocol identifiers that are assigned in a stable
and predictable manner.[¶](#section-3.1-1){.pilcrow}

A protocol identifier may only be reassigned for a different purpose
after due consideration of the impact of such a reassignment and, if
possible, with the consent of the original
assignee.[¶](#section-3.1-2){.pilcrow}

Recognizing that some assignments involve judgment, such as those
involving a designated expert \[[RFC8126](#RFC8126){.xref}\], a
predictable process does not require completion in a predetermined
number of days. Rather, it means that no unexpected steps are introduced
in the process of making an assignment.[¶](#section-3.1-3){.pilcrow}
:::

::: {#sect-3.2}
::: {#section-3.2 .section}
### [3.2.](#section-3.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Public](#name-public){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-public}

Once assigned, the protocol identifiers must be made available in a
manner that makes them freely available to everyone without
restrictions. The use of a consistent publication location builds
confidence in the registry. This does not mean that the publication
location can never change, but it does mean that it must change
infrequently and only after adequate prior
notice.[¶](#section-3.2-1){.pilcrow}
:::

::: {#sect-3.3}
::: {#section-3.3 .section}
### [3.3.](#section-3.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Open and Transparent](#name-open-and-transparent){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-open-and-transparent}

The process that sets the policy for protocol identifier assignment and
registration must be open to all interested parties and must operate in
a transparent manner.[¶](#section-3.3-1){.pilcrow}

When a registry is established, a policy is set for the addition of new
entries and the updating of existing entries. While making additions and
modifications, the registry operator may expose instances where policies
lack clarity. When this occurs, the registry operator should provide
helpful feedback to allow those policies to be improved. In addition,
the registry operator not being involved in establishing registry policy
avoids the risks associated with (perceptions of) favoritism and
unfairness.[¶](#section-3.3-2){.pilcrow}

Recognizing that some assignments involve judgment, such as those
involving a designated expert \[[RFC8126](#RFC8126){.xref}\], the
recommendations by designated experts must be visible to the public to
the maximum extent possible and subject to challenge or
appeal.[¶](#section-3.3-3){.pilcrow}
:::
:::

::: {#sect-3.4}
::: {#section-3.4 .section}
### [3.4.](#section-3.4){.section-number .selfRef} [Accountable](#name-accountable){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-accountable}

The process that sets the policy for IANA registries and the operation
of the registries must be accountable to the parties that rely on the
protocol identifiers. Oversight is needed to ensure these are properly
serving the affected community.[¶](#section-3.4-1){.pilcrow}

In practice, accountability mechanisms for the registry operator may be
defined by a contract, memoranda of understanding, or service level
agreements (SLAs). An oversight body uses these mechanisms to ensure
that the registry operator is meeting the needs of the affected
community. The oversight body is held accountable to the affected
community by vastly different mechanisms \-- for instance, recall and
appeal processes.[¶](#section-3.4-2){.pilcrow}

For protocol parameters \[[RFC6220](#RFC6220){.xref}\], the general
oversight of the IANA function is performed by the IAB as a chartered
responsibility from \[[RFC2850](#RFC2850){.xref}\]. In addition, the
IETF Administration Limited Liability Company (IETF LLC), as part of the
IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA), is responsible for IETF
administrative and financial matters \[[RFC8711](#RFC8711){.xref}\]. In
that role, the IETF LLC maintains an SLA with the current registry
operator, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers
(ICANN), thereby specifying the operational requirements with respect to
the coordination, maintenance, and publication of the protocol parameter
registries. Both the IAB and the Board of the IETF LLC are accountable
to the larger Internet community and are being held accountable through
the IETF NomCom process
\[[RFC8713](#RFC8713){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3.4-3){.pilcrow}

For the Internet Number Registries \[[RFC7249](#RFC7249){.xref}\],
oversight is performed by the Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) as
described RFC 7020 \[[RFC7020](#RFC7020){.xref}\]. The RIRs are
member-based organizations, and they are accountable to the affected
community by elected governance boards. Furthermore, per agreement
between the RIRs and ICANN, the policy development for the global IANA
number registries is coordinated by a community-elected number council
and subject to process review before ratification by the ICANN Board of
Trustees \[[ASOMOU](#ASOMOU){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3.4-4){.pilcrow}

Internet registries are critical to elements of Internet security. The
principles described in this document are necessary for the Internet
community to place trust in the IANA
registries.[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

[Section 3.4](#sect-3.4){.xref} has been updated to align with the
restructuring of the IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA). Under
the new structure, the IETF LLC maintains an SLA with the protocol
parameter registry operator. Under the old structure, the SLA was
maintained by the IETF Administrative Oversight Committee
(IAOC).[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}
