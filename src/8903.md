The DDoS Open Threat Signaling (DOTS) effort is intended to provide
protocols to facilitate interoperability across disparate DDoS
Mitigation solutions. This document presents sample use cases that
describe the interactions expected between the DOTS components as well
as DOTS messaging exchanges. These use cases are meant to identify the
interacting DOTS components, how they collaborate, and what the typical
information to be exchanged is.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

At the time of writing, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack
mitigation solutions are largely based upon siloed, proprietary
communications schemes with vendor lock-in as a side effect. This can
result in the configuration, provisioning, operation, and activation of
these solutions being a highly manual and often time-consuming process.
Additionally, coordinating multiple DDoS Mitigation solutions
simultaneously is fraught with both technical and process-related
hurdles. This greatly increases operational complexity, which in turn
can degrade the efficacy of mitigations that are generally highly
dependent on a timely reaction by the system.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

The DDoS Open Threat Signaling (DOTS) effort is intended to specify
protocols that facilitate interoperability between diverse DDoS
Mitigation solutions and ensure greater integration in terms of attack
detection, mitigation requests, and attack characterization
patterns.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

As DDoS solutions are broadly heterogeneous among vendors, the primary
goal of DOTS is to provide high-level interaction amongst differing DDoS
solutions, such as detecting DDoS attacks, initiating/terminating DDoS
Mitigation assistance, or requesting the status of a DDoS
Mitigation.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

This document provides sample use cases that provided input for the
requirements \[[RFC8612](#RFC8612){.xref}\] and design of the DOTS
protocols \[[RFC8782](#RFC8782){.xref}\]\[[RFC8783](#RFC8783){.xref}\].
The use cases are not exhaustive, and future use cases are expected to
emerge as DOTS is adopted and evolves.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC8612](#RFC8612){.xref}\]. In addition, it uses the terms defined
below:[¶](#section-2-1){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

DDoS Mitigation System (DMS):
:   A system that performs DDoS Mitigation. The DDoS Mitigation System
    may be composed of a cluster of hardware and/or software resources
    but could also involve an orchestrator that may make decisions, such
    as outsourcing some or all of the mitigation to another DDoS
    Mitigation System.[¶](#section-2-2.2){.pilcrow}
:   

DDoS Mitigation:
:   The action performed by the DDoS Mitigation
    System.[¶](#section-2-2.4){.pilcrow}
:   

DDoS Mitigation Service:
:   Designates a service provided to a customer to mitigate DDoS
    attacks. Each service subscription usually involve Service Level
    Agreement (SLA) that has to be met. It is the responsibility of the
    DDoS Service provider to instantiate the DDoS Mitigation System to
    meet these SLAs.[¶](#section-2-2.6){.pilcrow}
:   

DDoS Mitigation Service Provider:
:   Designates the administrative entity providing the DDoS Mitigation
    Service.[¶](#section-2-2.8){.pilcrow}
:   

Internet Transit Provider (ITP):
:   Designates the entity that delivers the traffic to a customer
    network. It can be an Internet Service Provider (ISP) or an upstream
    entity delivering the traffic to the
    ISP.[¶](#section-2-2.10){.pilcrow}

### [3.1.](#section-3.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Upstream DDoS Mitigation by an Upstream Internet Transit Provider](#name-upstream-ddos-mitigation-by){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-upstream-ddos-mitigation-by}

This use case describes how an enterprise or a residential customer
network may take advantage of a pre-existing relation with its ITP in
order to mitigate a DDoS attack targeting its
network.[¶](#section-3.1-1){.pilcrow}

For clarity of discussion, the targeted network is indicated as an
enterprise network, but the same scenario applies to any downstream
network, including residential and cloud hosting
networks.[¶](#section-3.1-2){.pilcrow}

As the ITP provides connectivity to the enterprise network, it is
already on the path of the inbound and outbound traffic of the
enterprise network and is well aware of the networking parameters
associated with the enterprise network WAN connectivity. This eases both
the configuration and the instantiation of a DDoS Mitigation
Service.[¶](#section-3.1-3){.pilcrow}

This section considers two kinds of DDoS Mitigation Service between an
enterprise network and an ITP:[¶](#section-3.1-4){.pilcrow}

-   [The upstream ITP may instantiate a DMS upon receiving a request
    from the enterprise network. This typically corresponds to a case
    when the enterprise network is under
    attack.[¶](#section-3.1-5.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.1-5.1}
-   [On the other hand, the ITP may identify an enterprise network as
    the source of an attack and send a mitigation request to the
    enterprise DMS to mitigate this at the
    source.[¶](#section-3.1-5.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.1-5.2}

The two scenarios, though different, have similar interactions between
the DOTS client and server. For the sake of simplicity, only the first
scenario will be detailed in this section. Nevertheless, the second
scenario is also in scope for DOTS.[¶](#section-3.1-6){.pilcrow}

In the first scenario, as depicted in [Figure 1](#fig-1){.xref}, an
enterprise network with self-hosted Internet-facing properties such as
web servers, authoritative DNS servers, and Voice over IP (VoIP) servers
has a DMS deployed to protect those servers and applications from DDoS
attacks. In addition to on-premise DDoS defense capabilities, the
enterprise has contracted with its ITP for DDoS Mitigation Services when
attacks threaten to overwhelm the bandwidth of their WAN
link(s).[¶](#section-3.1-7){.pilcrow}

[Figure 1](#figure-1){.selfRef}: [Upstream Internet Transit Provider
DDoS Mitigation](#name-upstream-internet-transit-p){.selfRef}
:::

The enterprise DMS is configured such that if the incoming Internet
traffic volume exceeds 50% of the provisioned upstream Internet WAN link
capacity, the DMS will request DDoS Mitigation assistance from the
upstream transit provider. More sophisticated detection means may be
considered as well.[¶](#section-3.1-9){.pilcrow}

The requests to trigger, manage, and finalize a DDoS Mitigation between
the enterprise DMS and the ITP are made using DOTS. The enterprise DMS
implements a DOTS client while the ITP implements a DOTS server, which
is integrated with their DMS in this
example.[¶](#section-3.1-10){.pilcrow}

When the enterprise DMS locally detects an inbound DDoS attack targeting
its resources (e.g., servers, hosts, or applications), it immediately
begins a DDoS Mitigation.[¶](#section-3.1-11){.pilcrow}

During the course of the attack, the inbound traffic volume to the
enterprise network exceeds the 50% threshold, and the enterprise DMS
escalates the DDoS Mitigation. The enterprise DMS DOTS client signals to
the DOTS server on the upstream ITP to initiate DDoS Mitigation. The
DOTS server replies to the DOTS client that it can serve this request,
and mitigation is initiated on the ITP network by the ITP
DMS.[¶](#section-3.1-12){.pilcrow}

Over the course of the attack, the DOTS server of the ITP periodically
informs the DOTS client on the mitigation status, statistics related to
DDoS attack traffic mitigation, and related information. Once the DDoS
attack has ended or decreased to a certain level that the enterprise DMS
might handle by itself, the DOTS server signals the enterprise DMS DOTS
client that the attack has subsided.[¶](#section-3.1-13){.pilcrow}

The DOTS client on the enterprise DMS then requests that the ITP
terminate the DDoS Mitigation. The DOTS server on the ITP receives this
request and, once the mitigation has ended, confirms the end of upstream
DDoS Mitigation to the enterprise DMS DOTS
client.[¶](#section-3.1-14){.pilcrow}

The following is an overview of the DOTS communication model for this
use case:[¶](#section-3.1-15){.pilcrow}

1.  [A DDoS attack is initiated against resources of a network
    organization (here, the enterprise), which has deployed a
    DOTS-capable DMS \-- typically a DOTS
    client.[¶](#section-3.1-16.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.1-16.1}
2.  [The enterprise DMS detects, classifies, and begins the DDoS
    Mitigation.[¶](#section-3.1-16.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.1-16.2}
3.  [The enterprise DMS determines that its capacity and/or capability
    to mitigate the DDoS attack is insufficient and sends a DOTS DDoS
    Mitigation request via its DOTS client to one or more DOTS servers
    residing on the upstream
    ITP.[¶](#section-3.1-16.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.1-16.3}
4.  [The DOTS server, which receives the DOTS Mitigation request,
    determines that it has been configured to honor requests from the
    requesting DOTS client and does so by orchestrating its own
    DMS.[¶](#section-3.1-16.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.1-16.4}
5.  [While the DDoS Mitigation is active, the DOTS server regularly
    transmits DOTS DDoS Mitigation status updates to the DOTS
    client.[¶](#section-3.1-16.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.1-16.5}
6.  [Informed by the DOTS server status update that the attack has ended
    or subsided, the DOTS client transmits a DOTS DDoS Mitigation
    termination request to the DOTS
    server.[¶](#section-3.1-16.6){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.1-16.6}
7.  [The DOTS server terminates DDoS Mitigation and sends the
    notification to the DOTS
    client.[¶](#section-3.1-16.7){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.1-16.7}

Note that communications between the enterprise DOTS client and the
upstream ITP DOTS server may take place in band within the main Internet
WAN link between the enterprise and the ITP; out of band via a separate,
dedicated wireline network link utilized solely for DOTS signaling; or
out of band via some other form of network connectivity such as
third-party wireless 4G network
connectivity.[¶](#section-3.1-17){.pilcrow}

Note also that a DOTS client that sends a DOTS Mitigation request may
also be triggered by a network admin that manually confirms the request
to the upstream ITP, in which case the request may be sent from an
application such as a web browser or a dedicated mobile
application.[¶](#section-3.1-18){.pilcrow}

Note also that when the enterprise is multihomed and connected to
multiple upstream ITPs, each ITP is only able to provide a DDoS
Mitigation Service for the traffic it transits. As a result, the
enterprise network may be required to coordinate the various DDoS
Mitigation Services associated with each link. More multihoming
considerations are discussed in
\[[DOTS-MULTIHOMING](#I-D.ietf-dots-multihoming){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3.1-19){.pilcrow}

This use case differs from the previous use case described in [Section
3.1](#use-case-1){.xref} in that the DDoS Mitigation Service is not
provided by an upstream ITP. In other words, as represented in [Figure
2](#fig-2){.xref}, the traffic is not forwarded through the DDoS
Mitigation Service Provider by default. In order to steer the traffic to
the DDoS Mitigation Service Provider, some network configuration changes
are required. As such, this use case is likely to apply to large
enterprises or large data centers but, as for the other use cases, is
not exclusively limited to them.[¶](#section-3.2-1){.pilcrow}

Another typical scenario for this use case is for there to be a
relationship between DDoS Mitigation Service Providers, forming an
overlay of DMS. When a DDoS Mitigation Service Provider mitigating a
DDoS attack reaches its resource capacity, it may choose to delegate the
DDoS Mitigation to another DDoS Mitigation Service
Provider.[¶](#section-3.2-2){.pilcrow}

[Figure 2](#figure-2){.selfRef}: [DDoS Mitigation between an Enterprise
Network and a Third-Party DDoS Mitigation Service
Provider](#name-ddos-mitigation-between-an-){.selfRef}
:::

In this scenario, an enterprise network has entered into a prearranged
DDoS Mitigation assistance agreement with one or more third-party DDoS
Mitigation Service Providers in order to ensure that sufficient DDoS
Mitigation capacity and/or capabilities may be activated in the event
that a given DDoS attack threatens to overwhelm the ability of the
enterprise or any other given DMS to mitigate the attack on its
own.[¶](#section-3.2-4){.pilcrow}

The prearrangement typically includes agreement on the mechanisms used
to redirect the traffic to the DDoS Mitigation Service Provider, as well
as the mechanism to re-inject the traffic back to the Enterprise
Network. Redirection to the DDoS Mitigation Service Provider typically
involves BGP prefix announcement or DNS redirection, while re-injection
of the scrubbed traffic to the enterprise network may be performed via
tunneling mechanisms (e.g., GRE). The exact mechanisms used for traffic
steering are out of scope of DOTS but will need to be prearranged, while
in some contexts such changes could be detected and considered as an
attack.[¶](#section-3.2-5){.pilcrow}

In some cases, the communication between the enterprise DOTS client and
the DOTS server of the DDoS Mitigation Service Provider may go through
the ITP carrying the DDoS attack, which would affect the communication.
On the other hand, the communication between the DOTS client and DOTS
server may take a path that is not undergoing a DDoS
attack.[¶](#section-3.2-6){.pilcrow}

Service Provider](#name-redirection-to-a-ddos-mitig){.selfRef}
:::

When the enterprise network is under attack or at least is reaching its
capacity or ability to mitigate a given DDoS attack, the DOTS client
sends a DOTS request to the DDoS Mitigation Service Provider to initiate
network traffic diversion \-- as represented in [Figure
3](#fig-3){.xref} \-- and DDoS Mitigation activities. Ongoing attack and
mitigation status messages may be passed between the enterprise network
and the DDoS Mitigation Service Provider using DOTS. If the DDoS attack
has stopped or the severity of the attack has subsided, the DOTS client
can request that the DDoS Mitigation Service Provider terminate the DDoS
Mitigation.[¶](#section-3.2-8){.pilcrow}

### [3.3.](#section-3.3){.section-number .selfRef} [DDoS Orchestration](#name-ddos-orchestration){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-ddos-orchestration}

In this use case, one or more DDoS telemetry systems or monitoring
devices monitor a network \-- typically an ISP network, an enterprise
network, or a data center. Upon detection of a DDoS attack, these DDoS
telemetry systems alert an orchestrator in charge of coordinating the
various DMSs within the domain. The DDoS telemetry systems may be
configured to provide required information, such as a preliminary
analysis of the observation, to the
orchestrator.[¶](#section-3.3-1){.pilcrow}

The orchestrator analyzes the various sets of information it receives
from DDoS telemetry systems and initiates one or more DDoS Mitigation
strategies. For example, the orchestrator could select the DMS in the
enterprise network or one provided by the
ITP.[¶](#section-3.3-2){.pilcrow}

DMS selection and DDoS Mitigation techniques may depend on the type of
the DDoS attack. In some cases, a manual confirmation or selection may
also be required to choose a proposed strategy to initiate a DDoS
Mitigation. The DDoS Mitigation may consist of multiple steps such as
configuring the network or updating already-instantiated DDoS Mitigation
functions. Eventually, the coordination of the mitigation may involve
external DDoS Mitigation resources such as a transit provider or a
third-party DDoS Mitigation Service
Provider.[¶](#section-3.3-3){.pilcrow}

The communication used to trigger a DDoS Mitigation between the DDoS
telemetry and monitoring systems and the orchestrator is performed using
DOTS. The DDoS telemetry system implements a DOTS client while the
orchestrator implements a DOTS server.[¶](#section-3.3-4){.pilcrow}

The communication between a network administrator and the orchestrator
is also performed using DOTS. The network administrator uses, for
example, a web interface that interacts with a DOTS client, while the
orchestrator implements a DOTS server.[¶](#section-3.3-5){.pilcrow}

The communication between the orchestrator and the DMSs is performed
using DOTS. The orchestrator implements a DOTS client while the DMSs
implement a DOTS server.[¶](#section-3.3-6){.pilcrow}

The configuration aspects of each DMS, as well as the instantiations of
DDoS Mitigation functions or network configuration, are not part of
DOTS. Similarly, the discovery of available DDoS Mitigation functions is
not part of DOTS and, as such, is out of
scope.[¶](#section-3.3-7){.pilcrow}

[Figure 4](#figure-4){.selfRef}: [DDoS
Orchestration](#name-ddos-orchestration-2){.selfRef}
:::

The DDoS telemetry systems monitor various aspects of the network
traffic and perform some measurement tasks.[¶](#section-3.3-9){.pilcrow}

These systems are configured so that when an event or some measurement
indicators reach a predefined level, their associated DOTS client sends
a DOTS mitigation request to the orchestrator DOTS server. The DOTS
mitigation request may be associated with some optional mitigation hints
to let the orchestrator know what has triggered the request. In
particular, it is possible for something that looks like an attack
locally to one telemetry system is not actually an attack when seen from
the broader scope (e.g., of the
orchestrator).[¶](#section-3.3-10){.pilcrow}

Upon receipt of the DOTS mitigation request from the DDoS telemetry
system, the orchestrator DOTS server responds with an acknowledgment to
avoid retransmission of the request for mitigation. The orchestrator may
begin collecting additional fine-grained and specific information from
various DDoS telemetry systems in order to correlate the measurements
and provide an analysis of the event. Eventually, the orchestrator may
ask for additional information from the DDoS telemetry system; however,
the collection of this information is out of scope of
DOTS.[¶](#section-3.3-11){.pilcrow}

The orchestrator may be configured to start a DDoS Mitigation upon
approval from a network administrator. The analysis from the
orchestrator is reported to the network administrator via, for example,
a web interface. If the network administrator decides to start the
mitigation, the network administrator triggers the DDoS Mitigation
request using, for example, a web interface of a DOTS client
communicating to the orchestrator DOTS server. This request is expected
to be associated with a context that provides sufficient information to
the orchestrator DOTS server to infer, elaborate, and coordinate the
appropriate DDoS Mitigation.[¶](#section-3.3-12){.pilcrow}

Upon receiving a request to mitigate a DDoS attack aimed at a target,
the orchestrator may evaluate the volume of the attack as well as the
value that the target represents. The orchestrator may select the DDoS
Mitigation Service Provider based on the attack severity. It may also
coordinate the DDoS Mitigation performed by the DDoS Mitigation Service
Provider with some other tasks such as, for example, moving the target
to another network so new sessions will not be impacted. The
orchestrator requests a DDoS Mitigation by the selected DMSs via its
DOTS client, as described in [Section
3.1](#use-case-1){.xref}.[¶](#section-3.3-13){.pilcrow}

The orchestrator DOTS client is notified that the DDoS Mitigation is
effective by the selected DMSs. The orchestrator DOTS server returns
this information to the network
administrator.[¶](#section-3.3-14){.pilcrow}

Similarly, when the DDoS attack has stopped, the orchestrator DOTS
client is notified and the orchestrator\'s DOTS server indicates the end
of the DDoS Mitigation to the DDoS telemetry systems as well as to the
network administrator.[¶](#section-3.3-15){.pilcrow}

In addition to the DDoS orchestration shown in [Figure
4](#fig-4){.xref}, the selected DMS can return a mitigation request to
the orchestrator as an offloading. For example, when the DDoS attack
becomes severe and the DMS\'s utilization rate reaches its maximum
capacity, the DMS can send mitigation requests with additional hints,
such as its blocked traffic information, to the orchestrator. Then the
orchestrator can take further actions such as requesting forwarding
nodes (e.g., routers) to filter the traffic. In this case, the DMS
implements a DOTS client while the orchestrator implements a DOTS
server. Similar to other DOTS use cases, the offloading scenario assumes
that some validation checks are followed by the DMS, the orchestrator,
or both (e.g., avoid exhausting the resources of the forwarding nodes or
inadvertent disruption of legitimate services). These validation checks
are part of the mitigation and are therefore out of the scope of the
document.[¶](#section-3.3-16){.pilcrow}

The document does not describe any protocol, though there are still a
few high-level security considerations to
discuss.[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

DOTS is at risk from three primary attacks: DOTS agent impersonation,
traffic injection, and signaling blocking.[¶](#section-4-2){.pilcrow}

Impersonation and traffic injection mitigation can be mitigated through
current secure communications best practices, including mutual
authentication. Preconfigured mitigation steps to take on the loss of
keepalive traffic can partially mitigate signal blocking. But in
general, it is impossible to comprehensively defend against an attacker
that can selectively block any or all traffic. Alternate communication
paths that are (hopefully) not subject to blocking by the attacker in
question is another potential mitigation.[¶](#section-4-3){.pilcrow}

Additional details of DOTS security requirements can be found in
\[[RFC8612](#RFC8612){.xref}\].[¶](#section-4-4){.pilcrow}

Service disruption may be experienced if inadequate mitigation actions
are applied. These considerations are out of the scope of
DOTS.[¶](#section-4-5){.pilcrow}
