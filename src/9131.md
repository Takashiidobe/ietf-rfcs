# RFC 9131 {#rfcnum}

# Gratuitous Neighbor Discovery: Creating Neighbor Cache Entries on First‑Hop Routers {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

Neighbor Discovery (RFC 4861) is used by IPv6 nodes to determine the
link-layer addresses of neighboring nodes as well as to discover and
maintain reachability information. This document updates RFC 4861 to
allow routers to proactively create a Neighbor Cache entry when a new
IPv6 address is assigned to a node. It also updates RFC 4861 and
recommends that nodes send unsolicited Neighbor Advertisements upon
assigning a new IPv6 address. These changes will minimize the delay and
packet loss when a node initiates connections to an off-link destination
from a new IPv6 address.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

The Neighbor Discovery state machine defined in
\[[RFC4861](#RFC4861){.xref}\] assumes that communications between IPv6
nodes are, in most cases, bidirectional and if a node A is trying to
communicate to its neighbor, node B, the return traffic flows could be
expected. So, when node A starts the address resolution process, the
target node B would also create an entry containing A\'s IPv6 and
link-layer addresses in its Neighbor Cache. That entry will be used for
sending the return traffic to A.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

In particular, [Section
7.2.5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4861#section-7.2.5){.relref} of
\[[RFC4861](#RFC4861){.xref}\] states:[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

> When a valid Neighbor Advertisement is received (either solicited or
> unsolicited), the Neighbor Cache is searched for the target\'s entry.
> If no entry exists, the advertisement [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be silently
> discarded. There is no need to create an entry if none exists, since
> the recipient has apparently not initiated any communication with the
> target.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

While this approach is perfectly suitable for host-to-host on-link
communications, it does not work so well when a host sends traffic to
off-link destinations. After joining the network and receiving a Router
Advertisement, the host populates its Neighbor Cache with the default
router IPv6 and link-layer addresses and is able to send traffic to
off-link destinations. At the same time, the router does not have any
cache entries for the host global addresses yet and only starts address
resolution upon receiving the first packet of the return traffic flow.
While waiting for the resolution to complete, routers only keep a very
small number of packets in the queue, as recommended in [Section
7.2.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4861#section-7.2.2){.relref} of
\[[RFC4861](#RFC4861){.xref}\]. Any additional packets arriving before
the resolution process finishes are likely to result in dropped packets.
It can cause packet loss and performance degradation that can be visible
to users.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

This document updates the Neighbor Discovery protocol
\[[RFC4861](#RFC4861){.xref}\] to avoid packet loss in the scenario
described above. [Section 4](#changes){.xref} discusses the changes and
analyzes the potential impact, while normative changes to
\[[RFC4861](#RFC4861){.xref}\] are specified in [Section
6](#RFC_UPD){.xref}.[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}

## [2.](#section-2){.section-number .selfRef} [Problem Statement](#name-problem-statement){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-problem-statement}

The most typical scenario when the problem described in this document
may arise is a host joining the network, forming a new address, and
using that address for accessing the
Internet:[¶](#section-2-1){.pilcrow}

1.  [A host joins the network and receives a Router Advertisement (RA)
    packet from the first-hop router (either a periodic unsolicited RA
    or a response to a Router Solicitation sent by the host). The RA
    contains information the host needs to perform SLAAC and to
    configure its network stack. The RA is sent from the router\'s
    link-local address to a link-local destination address and may
    contain the link-layer address of the router. As a result, the host
    can populate its Neighbor Cache with the router\'s link-local and
    link-layer addresses.[¶](#section-2-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-2-2.1}
2.  [The host starts opening connections to off-link destinations. A
    very common use case is a mobile device sending probes to detect
    Internet connectivity and/or the presence of a captive portal on the
    network. To speed up that process, many implementations use
    Optimistic DAD, which allows them to send probes before the DAD
    process is completed. At that moment, the device\'s Neighbor Cache
    contains all information required to send those probes (such as the
    default router link-local and link-layer addresses). The router\'s
    Neighbor Cache, however, might contain an entry for the device\'s
    link-local address (if the device has been performing address
    resolution for the router\'s link-local address), but there are no
    entries for any of the device\'s global
    addresses.[¶](#section-2-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-2-2.2}
3.  [Return traffic is received by the first-hop router. As the router
    does not have any cache entry for the host\'s global address yet,
    the router starts the Neighbor Discovery process by creating an
    INCOMPLETE cache entry and then sending a Neighbor Solicitation to
    the solicited-node multicast address ([Section
    7.3.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4861#section-7.3.2){.relref}
    of \[[RFC4861](#RFC4861){.xref}\]). As per [Section
    7.2.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4861#section-7.2.2){.relref}
    of \[[RFC4861](#RFC4861){.xref}\], routers [MUST]{.bcp14} buffer at
    least one data packet and [MAY]{.bcp14} buffer more, while resolving
    the packet destination address. However, most router implementations
    limit the buffer size to a few packets only, and some
    implementations are known to buffer just one packet. So, any
    subsequent packets arriving before the address resolution process is
    completed cause packet loss by replacing older packets in the
    buffer.[¶](#section-2-2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-2-2.3}
4.  [If the host sends multiple probes in parallel, in the worst case,
    it would consider all but one of them failed. That leads to
    user-visible delay in connecting to the network, especially if the
    host implements some form of backoff mechanism and does not
    retransmit the probes as soon as
    possible.[¶](#section-2-2.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-2-2.4}

This scenario illustrates the problem occurring when the device connects
to the network for the first time or after an inactivity period long
enough for the device\'s address to be removed from the router\'s
Neighbor Cache. However, the same sequence of events happens when the
host starts using a new global address previously unseen by the router,
such as a new privacy address \[[RFC8981](#RFC8981){.xref}\] or if the
router\'s Neighbor Cache has been flushed.[¶](#section-2-3){.pilcrow}

While in dual-stack networks this problem might be hidden by Happy
Eyeballs \[[RFC8305](#RFC8305){.xref}\], it manifests quite clearly in
IPv6-only environments, especially wireless environments, leading to
poor user experience and contributing to a negative perception of
IPv6-only solutions as unstable and
non-deployable.[¶](#section-2-4){.pilcrow}

It would be highly desirable to improve the Neighbor Discovery mechanics
so routers have a usable cache entry for a host address by the time the
router receives the first packet for that address. In
particular:[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

-   [If the router does not have a Neighbor Cache entry for the address,
    a STALE entry needs to be created proactively, prior to arrival of
    the first packet intended for that
    address.[¶](#section-3-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-2.1}
-   [The solution needs to work for Optimistic Addresses as well.
    Devices implementing Optimistic DAD usually attempt to minimize the
    delay in connecting to the network and therefore are more likely to
    be affected by the problem described in this
    document.[¶](#section-3-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-2.2}
-   [In the case of duplicate addresses present in the network, the
    solution should not override the existing
    entry.[¶](#section-3-2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-2.3}
-   [In topologies with multiple first-hop routers, the cache needs to
    be updated on all of them, as traffic might be asymmetric: outgoing
    flows leaving the network via one router while the return traffic
    enters the segment via another
    one.[¶](#section-3-2.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-2.4}

In addition, the solution must not exacerbate issues described in
\[[RFC6583](#RFC6583){.xref}\] and needs to be compatible with the
recommendations provided in
\[[RFC6583](#RFC6583){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3-3){.pilcrow}

### [4.1.](#section-4.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Nodes Sending Gratuitous Neighbor Advertisements](#name-nodes-sending-gratuitous-ne){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-nodes-sending-gratuitous-ne}

[Section
7.2.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4861#section-7.2.6){.relref} of
\[[RFC4861](#RFC4861){.xref}\] discusses using unsolicited Neighbor
Advertisements to inform node neighbors of the new link-layer address
quickly. The same mechanism could be used to notify the node neighbors
about the new network-layer address as well: the node can send
unsolicited Neighbor Advertisements upon assigning a new IPv6 address to
its interface.[¶](#section-4.1-1){.pilcrow}

To minimize potential disruption in the case of duplicate addresses, the
node should not set the Override flag for a preferred address and must
not set the Override flag if the address is in the Optimistic state
\[[RFC4429](#RFC4429){.xref}\].[¶](#section-4.1-2){.pilcrow}

As the main purpose of sending unsolicited NAs upon configuring a new
address is to proactively create a Neighbor Cache entry on the first-hop
routers, the gratuitous NAs are sent to the all-routers multicast
address (ff02::2). Limiting the recipients to routers only would help
reduce the multicast noise level. If the link-layer devices are
performing Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) snooping
\[[RFC4541](#RFC4541){.xref}\], then those unsolicited NAs will only be
sent to routers on the given network segment/link, instead of being
flooded to all nodes.[¶](#section-4.1-3){.pilcrow}

It should be noted that the mechanism discussed here does not cause any
significant increase in multicast traffic. The additional multicast
unsolicited NAs would proactively create a STALE cache entry on the
router, as discussed below. When the router receives the return traffic
flows, it does not need to send multicast NSes to the solicited-node
multicast address but would send unicast NSes instead. Therefore, this
procedure would only produce an increase in the overall amount of
multicast traffic if no return traffic arrives for the address that sent
the unsolicited NA or if the router does not create a STALE entry upon
receiving such an NA. The increase would be negligible, as that
additional traffic is a few orders of magnitude less than the usual
level of Neighbor Discovery multicast
traffic.[¶](#section-4.1-4){.pilcrow}

[Section
7.2.5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4861#section-7.2.5){.relref} of
\[[RFC4861](#RFC4861){.xref}\] states:[¶](#section-4.2-1){.pilcrow}

> When a valid Neighbor Advertisement is received (either solicited or
> unsolicited), the Neighbor Cache is searched for the target\'s entry.
> If no entry exists, the advertisement [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be silently
> discarded. There is no need to create an entry if none exists, since
> the recipient has apparently not initiated any communication with the
> target.[¶](#section-4.2-2){.pilcrow}

The reasoning behind dropping unsolicited Neighbor Advertisements (\"the
recipient has apparently not initiated any communication with the
target\") is valid for on-link host-to-host communication but, as
discussed in [Section 1](#Introduction){.xref}, it does not really apply
to the scenario when the host is announcing its address to routers.
Therefore, it would be beneficial to allow routers to create new entries
upon receiving an unsolicited Neighbor
Advertisement.[¶](#section-4.2-3){.pilcrow}

This document updates \[[RFC4861](#RFC4861){.xref}\] so that routers
create a new Neighbor Cache entry upon receiving an unsolicited Neighbor
Advertisement for an address that does not already have a Neighbor Cache
entry. These changes do not modify the router behavior specified in
\[[RFC4861](#RFC4861){.xref}\] for the scenario when the corresponding
Neighbor Cache entry already exists.[¶](#section-4.2-4){.pilcrow}

discusses the potential impact of creating a STALE entry for a duplicate
IPv6 address.[¶](#section-4.2-5){.pilcrow}

## [5.](#section-5){.section-number .selfRef} [Avoiding Disruption](#name-avoiding-disruption){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-avoiding-disruption}

If nodes following the recommendations in this document are using the
DAD mechanism defined in \[[RFC4862](#RFC4862){.xref}\], they would send
unsolicited NAs as soon as the address changes state from tentative to
preferred (after its uniqueness has been verified). However, nodes
willing to minimize network stack configuration delays might be using
Optimistic Addresses, which means there is a possibility of the address
not being unique on the link. [Section
2.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4429#section-2.2){.relref} of
\[[RFC4429](#RFC4429){.xref}\] discusses measures to ensure that ND
packets from the Optimistic Address do not override any existing
Neighbor Cache entries, as it would cause interruption of the rightful
address owner\'s traffic in the case of an address conflict. Nodes that
are willing to speed up their network stack configuration are most
likely to be affected by the problem outlined in this document;
therefore, it seems reasonable for such hosts to advertise their
Optimistic Addresses by sending unsolicited NAs. The main question to
consider is the potential risk of overriding the cache entry for the
rightful address owner if the Optimistic Address happens to be a
duplicate.[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

The following sections discuss the address collision scenario when a
node sends an unsolicited NA for an address in the Optimistic state,
while another node (the rightful owner) already has the same address
assigned. This document uses the term \"the rightful owner\", as the
same terminology is used in \[[RFC4429](#RFC4429){.xref}\]. The analysis
assumes that the host performs DAD, as [Section
5.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4862#section-5.4){.relref} of
\[[RFC4862](#RFC4862){.xref}\] requires that DAD [MUST]{.bcp14} be
performed on all unicast addresses prior to assigning them to an
interface.[¶](#section-5-2){.pilcrow}

### [5.1.](#section-5.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Neighbor Cache Entry Exists in Any State Other Than INCOMPLETE](#name-neighbor-cache-entry-exists){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-neighbor-cache-entry-exists}

If the router\'s Neighbor Cache entry for the target address already
exists in any state other than INCOMPLETE, then as per [Section
7.2.5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4861#section-7.2.5){.relref} of
\[[RFC4861](#RFC4861){.xref}\], an unsolicited NA with the Override flag
cleared would change the entry state from REACHABLE to STALE but would
not update the entry in any other way. Therefore, even if the host sends
an unsolicited NA from its Optimistic Address, the router\'s cache entry
would not be updated with the new link-layer address, and no impact on
the traffic for the rightful address owner is
expected.[¶](#section-5.1-1){.pilcrow}

The return traffic intended for the host with the Optimistic Address
would be sent to the rightful owner. However, this is unavoidable with
or without the unsolicited NA mechanism.[¶](#section-5.1-2){.pilcrow}

Another corner case is the INCOMPLETE cache entry for the
address.[¶](#section-5.2-1){.pilcrow}

1.  [The router receives a packet for the rightful owner of the
    address.[¶](#section-5.2-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.2-2.1}
2.  [The router starts the address resolution process by creating an
    INCOMPLETE entry and sends the multicast
    NS.[¶](#section-5.2-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.2-2.2}
3.  [More packets arrive at the router for the address in
    question.[¶](#section-5.2-2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.2-2.3}
4.  [The host configures an Optimistic Address and sends an unsolicited
    NA.[¶](#section-5.2-2.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.2-2.4}
5.  [The router creates a STALE entry and sends the buffered packet(s)
    to the host (while at least some of those packets are actually
    intended for the rightful
    owner).[¶](#section-5.2-2.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.2-2.5}
6.  [As the STALE entry was used to send packets, the router changes the
    entry state to DELAY and waits up to DELAY_FIRST_PROBE_TIME (5
    seconds) \[[RFC4861](#RFC4861){.xref}\] before sending a unicast
    NS.[¶](#section-5.2-2.6){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.2-2.6}
7.  [The rightful owner responds to the multicast NS sent at Step 2 with
    a solicited NA with the Override flag
    set.[¶](#section-5.2-2.7){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.2-2.7}
8.  [The router updates the entry with the TLLAO supplied (the rightful
    owner\'s link-layer address) and sets the entry state to REACHABLE
    (as the NA has the Solicited flag
    set).[¶](#section-5.2-2.8){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.2-2.8}

As a result, some packets (packets in the buffer at Step 6 and all
packets arriving between Step 6 and Step 8) are delivered to the host
with the Optimistic Address, while some of them, if not all, are
intended for the rightful owner. Without the unsolicited NA, one or more
packets that are in the buffer at Step 8 (usually just one packet, but
some routers may buffer a few) would have been delivered to the rightful
owner and the rest of the packets would have been dropped. However, the
probability of such a scenario is rather low, as it would require the
following things to happen almost simultaneously (within tens of
milliseconds in most cases):[¶](#section-5.2-3){.pilcrow}

-   [One host starts using a new IPv6 address and sending traffic
    without sending an unsolicited NA
    first.[¶](#section-5.2-4.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.2-4.1}
-   [Another host configures the same IPv6 address in Optimistic mode
    before the router completes the address resolution process for the
    rightful owner.[¶](#section-5.2-4.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.2-4.2}

It should be noted that in this scenario the rightful owner does not
send any unsolicited NAs before sending packets. If the rightful owner
implements the functionality described in this document and sends
unsolicited NAs upon configuring its address, then the router creates a
STALE entry for the address, causing all packets to be delivered to the
rightful owner (see [Section 5.1](#avoid_dis_exists){.xref}). The
rightful owner would experience no disruption but might receive some
packets intended for the host with an Optimistic
Address.[¶](#section-5.2-5){.pilcrow}

This section focuses on the scenario when the solicited NA from the
rightful owner arrives after the unsolicited one sent from the
Optimistic Address (Step 7 and Step 4, respectively). If the solicited
NA arrives first, it changes the NC entry state from INCOMPLETE to
REACHABLE. As discussed in [Section 5.1](#avoid_dis_exists){.xref},
there will be no disruption for the rightful owner if the router already
has a REACHABLE entry for the address when an unsolicited NA is
received.[¶](#section-5.2-6){.pilcrow}

There are two distinct scenarios that can lead to the situation when the
router does not have an NC entry for the IPv6
address:[¶](#section-5.3-1){.pilcrow}

1.  [The rightful owner of the address has not been using it for
    off-link communication recently or has never used it at
    all.[¶](#section-5.3-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.3-2.1}
2.  [The rightful owner just started sending packets from that address,
    but the router has not received any return traffic
    yet.[¶](#section-5.3-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.3-2.2}

The impact on the rightful owner\'s traffic flows would be different in
those cases.[¶](#section-5.3-3){.pilcrow}

In this scenario, the following events are expected to
happen:[¶](#section-5.3.1-1){.pilcrow}

1.  [The host configures the address and sets its state to
    Optimistic.[¶](#section-5.3.1-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.3.1-2.1}
2.  [The host sends an unsolicited NA with the Override flag set to zero
    and starts sending traffic from the Optimistic
    Address.[¶](#section-5.3.1-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.3.1-2.2}
3.  [The router creates a STALE entry for the address and the host

    address.[¶](#section-5.3.1-2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.3.1-2.3}
4.  [The host starts DAD and detects the address
    duplication.[¶](#section-5.3.1-2.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.3.1-2.4}
5.  [The router receives the return traffic for the duplicate address.
    As the NC entry is STALE, it sends traffic using that entry, changes
    it to DELAY, and waits up to DELAY_FIRST_PROBE_TIME seconds
    \[[RFC4861](#RFC4861){.xref}\].[¶](#section-5.3.1-2.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.3.1-2.5}
6.  [The router changes the NC entry state to PROBE and sends up to
    MAX_UNICAST_SOLICIT unicast NSes \[[RFC4861](#RFC4861){.xref}\]
    separated by RetransTimer milliseconds
    \[[RFC4861](#RFC4861){.xref}\] to the host link-layer
    address.[¶](#section-5.3.1-2.6){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.3.1-2.6}
7.  [As the host has already detected the address conflict, it does not
    respond to the unicast NSes. (It is unlikely that the host has not
    completed the DAD process at this stage, as DELAY_FIRST_PROBE_TIME
    (5 seconds) is much higher than the DAD duration
    (DupAddrDetectTransmits\*RetransTimer\*1000 +
    MAX_RTR_SOLICITATION_DELAY seconds) ([Section
    5.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4862#section-5.4){.relref} of
    \[[RFC4862](#RFC4862){.xref}\]).) The default value for the DAD
    process would be 1\*1\*1000 + 1 = 2 seconds
    \[[RFC4861](#RFC4861){.xref}\]. If the host has completed DAD but
    did not detect the address conflict, then there are two hosts with
    the same address in the preferred state and disruption is inevitable
    anyway.[¶](#section-5.3.1-2.7){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.3.1-2.7}
8.  [As the router receives no response for the unicast NSes, it deletes
    the NC entry.[¶](#section-5.3.1-2.8){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.3.1-2.8}
9.  [If return packets for communication initiated at Step 2 are still
    arriving, the router buffers a small number of those packets and
    starts the address resolution process again by sending a multicast
    NS to the solicited-node multicast address. The rightful owner
    responds, and the router\'s NC entry is updated with the rightful
    owner\'s link-local address. The buffered packet or packets are sent
    to that address. Any packets still arriving after the address
    resolution process has completed are sent to the rightful address
    owner as well.[¶](#section-5.3.1-2.9){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.3.1-2.9}

The rightful owner is not experiencing any disruption, as it does not
send any traffic. It would only start receiving packets intended for
another host after Step 8 is completed and only if return packets for
the communication initiated at Step 2 are still
arriving.[¶](#section-5.3.1-3){.pilcrow}

However, the same behavior would be observed if the changes specified in
this document are not implemented. If the host starts sending packets
from its Optimistic Address but then detects that the address is a
duplicate, the first return packet would trigger the address resolution
process and would be buffered until the resolution is completed. The
buffered packet(s) and any packets still arriving after the address is
resolved would be forwarded to the rightful owner of the address. So,
the rightful owner might still receive one or more packets from the
flows intended for another host. Therefore, it\'s safe to conclude that
the changes specified in this document do not introduce any disruption
for the rightful owner of the duplicated
address.[¶](#section-5.3.1-4){.pilcrow}

In this scenario, the following events are
happening:[¶](#section-5.3.2-1){.pilcrow}

    link-local
    address.[¶](#section-5.3.2-2.10){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.3.2-2.10}

As a result, the traffic for the address of the rightful owner would be
sent to the host with the duplicate address instead. The duration of the
disruption can be estimated as DELAY_FIRST_PROBE_TIME\*1000 +
(MAX_UNICAST_SOLICIT - 1)\*RetransTimer milliseconds. As per the
constants defined in [Section
10](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4861#section-10){.relref} of
\[[RFC4861](#RFC4861){.xref}\], this interval is equal to 5\*1000 + (3 -
1)\*1000 = 7000 milliseconds, or 7
seconds.[¶](#section-5.3.2-3){.pilcrow}

However, it should be noted that the probability of such a scenario is
rather low. Similar to the scenario discussed in [Section
5.2](#avoid_dis_inc){.xref}, it would require the following things to
happen almost simultaneously (within tens of milliseconds in most
cases):[¶](#section-5.3.2-4){.pilcrow}

-   [One host starts using a new IPv6 address and sending traffic
    without sending an unsolicited NA
    first.[¶](#section-5.3.2-5.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.3.2-5.1}

    before the router receives the return traffic for the first
    host.[¶](#section-5.3.2-5.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.3.2-5.2}

As discussed in [Section 5.2](#avoid_dis_inc){.xref}, the disruption for
the rightful owner can easily be prevented if that node implements the
mechanism described in this document. Sending unsolicited NAs before
initiating off-link communication would create a STALE entry in the
router\'s NC and prevent any traffic to that address from being sent to
the host with the Optimistic Address (see [Section

The solution described in this document provides some improvement for a
node configuring a new IPv6 address and starting to send traffic from
it. However, that approach does not completely eliminate the scenario
when a router receives some transit traffic for an address without the
corresponding Neighbor Cache entry. For
example:[¶](#section-7-1){.pilcrow}

-   [If the host starts using an already-configured IPv6 address after a
    long period of inactivity, the router might not have the NC entry
    for that address anymore, as old/expired entries are
    deleted.[¶](#section-7-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-7-2.1}
-   [Clearing the router\'s Neighbor Cache would trigger packet loss for
    all actively used addresses removed from the

Personal Area Networks (6LoWPANs) to the rest of the IPv6 deployments.

The host could force the creation of a STALE entry for its GUA in the
router\'s Neighbor Cache by sending the following Neighbor Solicitation
message:[¶](#section-8.3-1){.pilcrow}

-   [The NS source address is the host

The host could send a Router Solicitation message to the all-routers

address is included in the Source Link-Layer Address Option, the router
would create a STALE entry for the host GUA as per [Section

2.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4429#section-2.2){.relref} of
\[[RFC4429](#RFC4429){.xref}\] explicitly prohibits using an Optimistic
Address as the source address of a Router Solicitation with a SLLAO, as
it might cause disruption for the rightful owner of the address in the
case of a collision. So, for the Optimistic Addresses, the host can send
an RS without a SLLAO included. In that case, the router may respond
with either a multicast or unicast RA (only the latter would create a
cache entry).[¶](#section-8.4-1){.pilcrow}

This approach has the following drawbacks:[¶](#section-8.4-2){.pilcrow}

-   [If the address is in the Optimistic state, the RS cannot contain a
    SLLAO. As a result, the router would only create a cache entry if
    solicited RAs are sent as unicast. Routers sending solicited RAs as

    send a unicast packet back to the
    host.[¶](#section-8.4-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-8.4-3.1}

Routers may be able to learn about new addresses by gleaning from the
DAD Neighbor Solicitation messages. The router could listen to all
solicited-node multicast address groups and, upon receiving a Neighbor

the solicitation\'s target address. If no entry exists, the router may
create an entry, set its reachability state to INCOMPLETE, and start the

The same solution was proposed in

routing vendors already support such optimization. However, this
approach has a number of drawbacks and therefore should not be used as
the only solution:[¶](#section-8.5-2){.pilcrow}

When a router receives a transit packet sourced by an on-link neighbor
node, it might check for the presence of a Neighbor Cache entry for the
packet source address and, if the entry does not exist, start the
address resolution process. This approach does ensure that a Neighbor
Cache entry is proactively created every time a new, previously unseen
GUA is used for sending off-link traffic. However, this approach has a
number of limitations. In particular:[¶](#section-8.9-1){.pilcrow}

-   [If traffic flows are asymmetrical, the return traffic might not
    transit the same router as the original traffic that triggered the
    address resolution process. So, the Neighbor Cache entry is created
    on the \"wrong\" router, not the one that actually needs the
    Neighbor Cache entry for the host
    address.[¶](#section-8.9-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-8.9-2.1}
-   [The functionality needs to be limited to explicitly configured

One of the potential attack vectors to consider is cache spoofing, where
the attacker might try to install a cache entry for the victim\'s IPv6
address and the attacker\'s link-layer address. However, it should be
noted that this document does not propose any changes for the scenario
when the Neighbor Cache for a given IPv6 address already exists.
Therefore, there are no new vectors for an attacker to override an
existing cache entry.[¶](#section-10-1){.pilcrow}

[Section 5](#avoid_dis){.xref} describes some corner cases when a host
with a duplicate Optimistic Address might get some packets intended for
the rightful owner of the address. However, such scenarios do not
introduce any new attack vectors: even without the changes discussed in
this document, an attacker can easily override the router\'s Neighbor
Cache and redirect the traffic by sending NAs with the Solicited flag
set. As discussed in [Section 5.3.2](#dis_start){.xref}, the worst-case
scenario might cause a disruption for up to 7 seconds. Because this
scenario is highly unlikely, this risk of disruption is considered
acceptable. More importantly, for all cases described in [Section
5](#avoid_dis){.xref}, the rightful owner can prevent disruption caused
by an accidental address duplication just by implementing the mechanism
described in this document. If the rightful owner sends unsolicited NAs
before using the address, the STALE entry would be created on the
router\'s NC, and any subsequent unsolicited NAs sent from the host with
an Optimistic Address would not override the NC
entry.[¶](#section-10-2){.pilcrow}

A malicious host could attempt to exhaust the Neighbor Cache on the
router by creating a large number of STALE entries. However, this attack
vector is not new, and the mechanism specified in this document does not
increase the risk of such an attack: the attacker could do it, for
example, by sending an NS or RS packet with a SLLAO included. All
recommendations from \[[RFC6583](#RFC6583){.xref}\] still
apply.[¶](#section-10-3){.pilcrow}

Announcing a new address to the all-routers multicast address may inform
an on-link attacker about IPv6 addresses assigned to the host. However,
hiding information about the specific IPv6 address should not be
considered a security measure, as such information is usually disclosed
via DAD to all nodes anyway if MLD snooping is not enabled. Network
administrators can also mitigate this issue by enabling MLD snooping on
the link-layer devices to prevent IPv6 link-local multicast packets from
being flooded to all on-link nodes. If peer-to-peer on-link
communications are not desirable for a given network segment, they
should be prevented by proper Layer 2 security mechanisms. Therefore,
the risk of allowing hosts to send unsolicited Neighbor Advertisements
to the all-routers multicast address is low.[¶](#section-10-4){.pilcrow}

It should be noted that the mechanism discussed in this document allows
hosts to proactively inform their routers about global IPv6 addresses
existing on-link. Routers could use that information to distinguish
between used and unused addresses to mitigate Neighbor Cache exhaustion
DoS attacks as described in [Section
4.3.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3756#section-4.3.2){.relref} of
