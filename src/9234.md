# Route Leak Prevention and Detection Using Roles in UPDATE and OPEN Messages {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

Route leaks are the propagation of BGP prefixes that violate assumptions
of BGP topology relationships, e.g., announcing a route learned from one
transit provider to another transit provider or a lateral (i.e.,
non-transit) peer or announcing a route learned from one lateral peer to
another lateral peer or a transit provider. These are usually the result
of misconfigured or absent BGP route filtering or lack of coordination
between autonomous systems (ASes). Existing approaches to leak
prevention rely on marking routes by operator configuration, with no
check that the configuration corresponds to that of the External BGP
(eBGP) neighbor, or enforcement of the two eBGP speakers agreeing on the
peering relationship. This document enhances the BGP OPEN message to
establish an agreement of the peering relationship on each eBGP session
between autonomous systems in order to enforce appropriate configuration
on both sides. Propagated routes are then marked according to the agreed
relationship, allowing both prevention and detection of route
leaks.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

Route leaks are the propagation of BGP prefixes that violate assumptions
of BGP topology relationships, e.g., announcing a route learned from one
transit provider to another transit provider or a lateral (i.e.,
non-transit) peer or announcing a route learned from one lateral peer to
another lateral peer or a transit provider
\[[RFC7908](#RFC7908){.xref}\]. These are usually the result of
misconfigured or absent BGP route filtering or lack of coordination
between autonomous systems (ASes).[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

Existing approaches to leak prevention rely on marking routes by
operator configuration, with no check that the configuration corresponds
to that of the eBGP neighbor, or enforcement of the two eBGP speakers
agreeing on the relationship. This document enhances the BGP OPEN
message to establish an agreement of the relationship on each eBGP
session between autonomous systems in order to enforce appropriate
configuration on both sides. Propagated routes are then marked according
to the agreed relationship, allowing both prevention and detection of
route leaks.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

This document specifies a means of replacing the operator-driven
configuration-based method of route leak prevention, described above,
with an in-band method for route leak prevention and
detection.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

This method uses a new configuration parameter, BGP Role, which is
negotiated using a BGP Role Capability in the OPEN message
\[[RFC5492](#RFC5492){.xref}\]. An eBGP speaker may require the use of
this capability and confirmation of the BGP Role with a neighbor for the
BGP OPEN to succeed.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

An optional, transitive BGP Path Attribute, called \"Only to Customer
(OTC)\", is specified in [Section 5](#prevention_attribute){.xref}. It
prevents ASes from creating leaks and detects leaks created by the ASes
in the middle of an AS path. The main focus/applicability is the
Internet (IPv4 and IPv6 unicast route
advertisements).[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}

The terms \"local AS\" and \"remote AS\" are used to refer to the two
ends of an eBGP session. The \"local AS\" is the AS where the protocol
action being described is to be performed, and \"remote AS\" is the AS
at the other end of the eBGP session in
consideration.[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

The use of the term \"route is ineligible\" in this document has the
same meaning as in \[[RFC4271](#RFC4271){.xref}\], i.e., \"route is
ineligible to be installed in Loc-RIB and will be excluded from the next
phase of route selection.\"[¶](#section-3-2){.pilcrow}

### [3.1.](#section-3.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Peering Relationships](#name-peering-relationships){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-peering-relationships}

The terms for peering relationships defined and used in this document
(see below) do not necessarily represent business relationships based on
payment agreements. These terms are used to represent restrictions on
BGP route propagation, sometimes known as the Gao-Rexford model
\[[GAO-REXFORD](#GAO-REXFORD){.xref}\]. The terms \"Provider\",
\"Customer\", and \"Peer\" used here are synonymous to the terms
\"transit provider\", \"customer\", and \"lateral (i.e., non-transit)
peer\", respectively, used in
\[[RFC7908](#RFC7908){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3.1-1){.pilcrow}

The following is a list of BGP Roles for eBGP peering and the
corresponding rules for route propagation:[¶](#section-3.1-2){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

Provider:
:   [MAY]{.bcp14} propagate any available route to a
    Customer.[¶](#section-3.1-3.2){.pilcrow}
:   

Customer:
:   [MAY]{.bcp14} propagate any route learned from a Customer, or that
    is locally originated, to a Provider. All other routes [MUST
    NOT]{.bcp14} be propagated.[¶](#section-3.1-3.4){.pilcrow}
:   

Route Server (RS):
:   [MAY]{.bcp14} propagate any available route to a Route Server Client
    (RS-Client).[¶](#section-3.1-3.6){.pilcrow}
:   

Route Server Client (RS-Client):
:   [MAY]{.bcp14} propagate any route learned from a Customer, or that
    is locally originated, to an RS. All other routes [MUST NOT]{.bcp14}
    be propagated.[¶](#section-3.1-3.8){.pilcrow}
:   

Peer:
:   [MAY]{.bcp14} propagate any route learned from a Customer, or that
    is locally originated, to a Peer. All other routes [MUST
    NOT]{.bcp14} be propagated.[¶](#section-3.1-3.10){.pilcrow}
:   

If the local AS has one of the above Roles (in the order shown), then
the corresponding peering relationship with the remote AS is
Provider-to-Customer, Customer-to-Provider, RS-to-RS-Client,
RS-Client-to-RS, or Peer-to-Peer (i.e., lateral peers), respectively.
These are called normal peering
relationships.[¶](#section-3.1-4){.pilcrow}

If the local AS has more than one peering Role with the remote AS, such
a peering relation is called \"Complex\". An example is when the peering
relationship is Provider-to-Customer for some prefixes while it is
Peer-to-Peer for other prefixes
\[[GAO-REXFORD](#GAO-REXFORD){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3.1-5){.pilcrow}

A BGP speaker may apply policy to reduce what is announced, and a
recipient may apply policy to reduce the set of routes they
accept.[¶](#section-3.1-6){.pilcrow}

Violation of the route propagation rules listed above may result in
route leaks \[[RFC7908](#RFC7908){.xref}\]. Automatic enforcement of
these rules should significantly reduce route leaks that may otherwise
occur due to manual configuration mistakes.[¶](#section-3.1-7){.pilcrow}

As specified in [Section 5](#prevention_attribute){.xref}, the OTC
Attribute is used to identify all the routes in the AS that have been
received from a Peer, a Provider, or an RS.[¶](#section-3.1-8){.pilcrow}

## [4.](#section-4){.section-number .selfRef} [BGP Role](#name-bgp-role){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-bgp-role}

The BGP Role characterizes the relationship between the eBGP speakers
forming a session. One of the Roles described below [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be
configured at the local AS for each eBGP session (see definitions in
[Section 3](#terminology){.xref}) based on the local AS\'s knowledge of
its Role. The only exception is when the eBGP connection is Complex (see
[Section 6](#considerations){.xref}). BGP Roles are mutually confirmed
using the BGP Role Capability (described in [Section
4.1](#capability){.xref}) on each eBGP
session.[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

Allowed Roles for eBGP sessions are:[¶](#section-4-2){.pilcrow}

If the BGP Role is locally configured, the eBGP speaker [MUST]{.bcp14}
advertise the BGP Role Capability in the BGP OPEN message. An eBGP
speaker [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} advertise multiple versions of the BGP Role
Capability. The error handling when multiple BGP Role Capabilities are
received is described in [Section
4.2](#correctness){.xref}.[¶](#section-4.1-4){.pilcrow}

[Section 4.1](#capability){.xref} describes how the BGP Role encodes the
relationship on each eBGP session between
ASes.[¶](#section-4.2-1){.pilcrow}

The mere receipt of the BGP Role Capability does not automatically
guarantee the Role agreement between two eBGP neighbors. If the BGP Role
Capability is advertised, and one is also received from the peer, the
Roles [MUST]{.bcp14} correspond to the relationships in [Table
2](#allowed){.xref}. If the Roles do not correspond, the BGP speaker
[MUST]{.bcp14} reject the connection using the Role Mismatch
Notification (code 2, subcode 11).[¶](#section-4.2-2){.pilcrow}

For backward compatibility, if the BGP Role Capability is sent but one
is not received, the BGP Speaker [SHOULD]{.bcp14} ignore the absence of
the BGP Role Capability and proceed with session establishment. The
locally configured BGP Role is used for the procedures described in
[Section 5](#prevention_attribute){.xref}.[¶](#section-4.2-4){.pilcrow}

An operator may choose to apply a \"strict mode\" in which the receipt
of a BGP Role Capability from the remote AS is required. When operating
in the \"strict mode\", if the BGP Role Capability is sent but one is
not received, the connection is rejected using the Role Mismatch
Notification (code 2, subcode 11). See comments in [Section
8](#Security){.xref}.[¶](#section-4.2-5){.pilcrow}

If an eBGP speaker receives multiple but identical BGP Role Capabilities
with the same value in each, then the speaker considers them to be a
single BGP Role Capability and proceeds \[[RFC5492](#RFC5492){.xref}\].
If multiple BGP Role Capabilities are received and not all of them have
the same value, then the BGP speaker [MUST]{.bcp14} reject the
connection using the Role Mismatch Notification (code 2, subcode
11).[¶](#section-4.2-6){.pilcrow}

The BGP Role value for the local AS (in conjunction with the OTC
Attribute in the received UPDATE message) is used in the route leak
prevention and detection procedures described in [Section
5](#prevention_attribute){.xref}.[¶](#section-4.2-7){.pilcrow}

The OTC Attribute is an optional transitive Path Attribute of the UPDATE
message with Attribute Type Code 35 and a length of 4 octets. The
purpose of this attribute is to enforce that once a route is sent to a
Customer, a Peer, or an RS-Client (see definitions in [Section
3.1](#defs){.xref}), it will subsequently go only to the Customers. The
attribute value is an AS number (ASN) determined by the procedures
described below.[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

The following ingress procedure applies to the processing of the OTC
Attribute on route receipt:[¶](#section-5-2){.pilcrow}

1.  [If a route with the OTC Attribute is received from a Customer or an
    RS-Client, then it is a route leak and [MUST]{.bcp14} be considered
    ineligible (see [Section
    3](#terminology){.xref}).[¶](#section-5-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-5-3.1}
2.  [If a route with the OTC Attribute is received from a Peer (i.e.,
    remote AS with a Peer Role) and the Attribute has a value that is
    not equal to the remote (i.e., Peer\'s) AS number, then it is a
    route leak and [MUST]{.bcp14} be considered
    ineligible.[¶](#section-5-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-5-3.2}
3.  [If a route is received from a Provider, a Peer, or an RS and the
    OTC Attribute is not present, then it [MUST]{.bcp14} be added with a
    value equal to the AS number of the remote
    AS.[¶](#section-5-3.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-5-3.3}

The following egress procedure applies to the processing of the OTC
Attribute on route advertisement:[¶](#section-5-4){.pilcrow}

1.  [If a route is to be advertised to a Customer, a Peer, or an
    RS-Client (when the sender is an RS), and the OTC Attribute is not
    present, then when advertising the route, an OTC Attribute
    [MUST]{.bcp14} be added with a value equal to the AS number of the
    local AS.[¶](#section-5-5.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-5-5.1}
2.  [If a route already contains the OTC Attribute, it [MUST
    NOT]{.bcp14} be propagated to Providers, Peers, or
    RSes.[¶](#section-5-5.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-5-5.2}

The above-described procedures provide both leak prevention for the
local AS and leak detection and mitigation multiple hops away. In the
case of prevention at the local AS, the presence of an OTC Attribute
indicates to the egress router that the route was learned from a Peer, a
Provider, or an RS, and it can be advertised only to the Customers. The
same OTC Attribute that is set locally also provides a way to detect
route leaks by an AS multiple hops away if a route is received from a
Customer, a Peer, or an RS-Client. For example, if an AS sets the OTC
Attribute on a route sent to a Peer and the route is subsequently
received by a compliant AS from a Customer, then the receiving AS
detects (based on the presence of the OTC Attribute) that the route is a
leak.[¶](#section-5-6){.pilcrow}

The OTC Attribute might be set at the egress of the remote AS or at the
ingress of the local AS, i.e., if the remote AS is non-compliant with
this specification, then the local AS will have to set the OTC Attribute
if it is absent. In both scenarios, the OTC value will be the same. This
makes the scheme more robust and benefits early
adopters.[¶](#section-5-7){.pilcrow}

The OTC Attribute is considered malformed if the length value is not 4.
An UPDATE message with a malformed OTC Attribute [SHALL]{.bcp14} be
handled using the approach of \"treat-as-withdraw\"
\[[RFC7606](#RFC7606){.xref}\].[¶](#section-5-8){.pilcrow}

The BGP Role negotiation and OTC-Attribute-based procedures specified in
this document are [NOT RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14} to be used between
autonomous systems in an AS Confederation
\[[RFC5065](#RFC5065){.xref}\]. If an OTC Attribute is added on egress
from the AS Confederation, its value [MUST]{.bcp14} equal the AS
Confederation Identifier. Also, on egress from the AS Confederation, an
UPDATE [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} contain an OTC Attribute with a value
corresponding to any Member-AS Number other than the AS Confederation
Identifier.[¶](#section-5-9){.pilcrow}

The procedures specified in this document in scenarios that use private
AS numbers behind an Internet-facing ASN (e.g., a data-center network
\[[RFC7938](#RFC7938){.xref}\] or stub customer) may be used, but any
details are outside the scope of this document. On egress from the
Internet-facing AS, the OTC Attribute [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} contain a value
other than the Internet-facing ASN.[¶](#section-5-10){.pilcrow}

Once the OTC Attribute has been set, it [MUST]{.bcp14} be preserved
unchanged (this also applies to an AS
Confederation).[¶](#section-5-11){.pilcrow}

The described ingress and egress procedures are applicable only for the
address families AFI 1 (IPv4) and AFI 2 (IPv6) with SAFI 1 (unicast) in
both cases and [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be applied to other address families
by default. The operator [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} have the ability to modify
the procedures defined in this section.[¶](#section-5-12){.pilcrow}

## [6.](#section-6){.section-number .selfRef} [Additional Considerations](#name-additional-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-additional-considerations}

Roles [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be configured on an eBGP session with a Complex
peering relationship. If multiple eBGP sessions can segregate the
Complex peering relationship into eBGP sessions with normal peering
relationships, BGP Roles [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be used on each of the
resulting eBGP sessions.[¶](#section-6-1){.pilcrow}

An operator may want to achieve an equivalent outcome by configuring
policies on a per-prefix basis to follow the definitions of peering
relations as described in [Section 3.1](#defs){.xref}. However, in this
case, there are no in-band measures to check the correctness of the
per-prefix peering configuration.[¶](#section-6-2){.pilcrow}

The incorrect setting of BGP Roles and/or OTC Attributes may affect
prefix propagation. Further, this document does not specify any special
handling of an incorrect AS number in the OTC
Attribute.[¶](#section-6-3){.pilcrow}

In AS migration scenarios \[[RFC7705](#RFC7705){.xref}\], a given router
may represent itself as any one of several different ASes. This should
not be a problem since the egress procedures in [Section
5](#prevention_attribute){.xref} specify that the OTC Attribute is to be
attached as part of route transmission. Therefore, a router is expected
to set the OTC value equal to the ASN it is currently representing
itself as.[¶](#section-6-4){.pilcrow}

[Section 6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7606#section-6){.relref}
of \[[RFC7606](#RFC7606){.xref}\] documents possible negative impacts of
\"treat-as-withdraw\" behavior. Such negative impacts may include
forwarding loops or dropped traffic. It also discusses debugging
considerations related to this behavior.[¶](#section-6-5){.pilcrow}

IANA has registered a new BGP Capability ([Section
4.1](#capability){.xref}) in the \"Capability Codes\" registry within
the \"IETF Review\" range \[[RFC5492](#RFC5492){.xref}\]. The
description for the new capability is \"BGP Role\". IANA has assigned
the value 9. This document is the reference for the new

IANA has created and now maintains a new subregistry called \"BGP Role
Value\" within the \"Capability Codes\" registry. Registrations should
include a value, a role name, and a reference to the defining document.
IANA has registered the values in [Table 3](#role-table){.xref}. Future
assignments may be made by the \"IETF Review\" policy as defined in
\[[RFC8126](#RFC8126){.xref}\].[¶](#section-7-2){.pilcrow}

## [8.](#section-8){.section-number .selfRef} [Security Considerations](#name-security-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-security-considerations}

The security considerations of BGP (as specified in
\[[RFC4271](#RFC4271){.xref}\] and \[[RFC4272](#RFC4272){.xref}\])
apply.[¶](#section-8-1){.pilcrow}

This document proposes a mechanism that uses the BGP Role for the
prevention and detection of route leaks that are the result of BGP
policy misconfiguration. A misconfiguration of the BGP Role may affect
prefix propagation. For example, if a downstream (i.e., towards a
Customer) peering link were misconfigured with a Provider or Peer Role,
it would limit the number of prefixes that can be advertised in this
direction. On the other hand, if an upstream provider were misconfigured
(by a local AS) with the Customer Role, it may result in propagating
routes that are received from other Providers or Peers. But the BGP Role
negotiation and the resulting confirmation of Roles make such
misconfigurations unlikely.[¶](#section-8-2){.pilcrow}

Setting the strict mode of operation for BGP Role negotiation as the
default may result in a situation where the eBGP session will not come
up after a software update. Implementations with such default behavior
are strongly discouraged.[¶](#section-8-3){.pilcrow}

Removing the OTC Attribute or changing its value can limit the
opportunity for route leak detection. Such activity can be done on
purpose as part of an on-path attack. For example, an AS can remove the
OTC Attribute on a received route and then leak the route to its transit
provider. This kind of threat is not new in BGP, and it may affect any
Attribute (note that BGPsec \[[RFC8205](#RFC8205){.xref}\] offers
protection only for the AS_PATH Attribute).[¶](#section-8-4){.pilcrow}

Adding an OTC Attribute when the route is advertised from Customer to
Provider will limit the propagation of the route. Such a route may be
considered as ineligible by the immediate Provider or its Peers or
upper-layer Providers. This kind of OTC Attribute addition is unlikely
to happen on the Provider side because it will limit the traffic volume
towards its Customer. On the Customer side, adding an OTC Attribute for
traffic-engineering purposes is also discouraged because it will limit
route propagation in an unpredictable way.[¶](#section-8-5){.pilcrow}
