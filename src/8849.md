# Mapping RTP Streams to Controlling Multiple Streams for Telepresence (CLUE) Media Captures {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

This document describes how the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is
used in the context of the Controlling Multiple Streams for Telepresence
(CLUE) protocol. It also describes the mechanisms and recommended
practice for mapping RTP media streams, as defined in the Session
Description Protocol (SDP), to CLUE Media Captures and defines a new RTP
header extension (CaptureID).[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

Telepresence systems can send and receive multiple media streams. The
CLUE Framework \[[RFC8845](#RFC8845){.xref}\] defines Media Captures
(MCs) as a source of Media, from one or more Capture Devices. A Media
Capture may also be constructed from other Media streams. A middlebox
can express conceptual Media Captures that it constructs from Media
streams it receives. A Multiple Content Capture (MCC) is a special Media
Capture composed of multiple Media Captures.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

SIP Offer/Answer \[[RFC3264](#RFC3264){.xref}\] uses SDP
\[[RFC4566](#RFC4566){.xref}\] to describe the RTP media streams
\[[RFC3550](#RFC3550){.xref}\]. Each RTP stream has a unique
Synchronization Source (SSRC) within its RTP session. The content of the
RTP stream is created by an encoder in the endpoint. This may be an
original content from a camera or a content created by an intermediary
device like a Multipoint Control Unit (MCU).[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

This document makes recommendations for the CLUE architecture about how
RTP and RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) streams should be encoded and
transmitted and how their relation to CLUE Media Captures should be
communicated. The proposed solution supports multiple RTP topologies
\[[RFC7667](#RFC7667){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

With regards to the media (audio, video, and timed text), systems that
support CLUE use RTP for the media, SDP for codec and media transport
negotiation (CLUE individual encodings), and the CLUE protocol for Media
Capture description and selection. In order to associate the media in
the different protocols, there are three mappings that need to be
specified:[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

3.  [RTP streams to MC to map the received RTP stream to the current MC

## [3.](#section-3){.section-number .selfRef} [RTP Topologies for CLUE](#name-rtp-topologies-for-clue){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-rtp-topologies-for-clue}

The typical RTP topologies used by CLUE telepresence systems specify
different behaviors for RTP and RTCP distribution. A number of RTP
topologies are described in \[[RFC7667](#RFC7667){.xref}\]. For CLUE
telepresence, the relevant topologies include Point-to-Point, as well as
Media-Mixing Mixers, Media-Switching Mixers, and Selective Forwarding
Middleboxes.[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

In the Point-to-Point topology, one peer communicates directly with a
single peer over unicast. There can be one or more RTP sessions, each
sent on a separate 5-tuple, that have a separate SSRC space, with each
RTP session carrying multiple RTP streams identified by their SSRC. All
SSRCs are recognized by the peers based on the information in the RTCP
Source description (SDES) report that includes the Canonical Name
(CNAME) and SSRC of the sent RTP streams. There are different
Point-to-Point use cases as specified in the CLUE use case
\[[RFC7205](#RFC7205){.xref}\]. In some cases, a CLUE session that, at a
high level, is Point-to-Point may nonetheless have an RTP stream that is
best described by one of the mixer topologies. For example, a CLUE
endpoint can produce composite or switched captures for use by a
receiving system with fewer displays than the sender has cameras. The
Media Capture may be described using an MCC.[¶](#section-3-2){.pilcrow}

For the media mixer topology \[[RFC7667](#RFC7667){.xref}\], the peers
communicate only with the mixer. The mixer provides mixed or composited
media streams, using its own SSRC for the sent streams. If needed by the
CLUE endpoint, the conference roster information including conference
participants, endpoints, media, and media-id (SSRC) can be determined
using the conference event package \[[RFC4575](#RFC4575){.xref}\]
element.[¶](#section-3-3){.pilcrow}

Media-Switching Mixers and Selective Forwarding Middleboxes behave as
described in \[[RFC7667](#RFC7667){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3-4){.pilcrow}

## [4.](#section-4){.section-number .selfRef} [Mapping CLUE Capture Encodings to RTP Streams](#name-mapping-clue-capture-encodi){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-mapping-clue-capture-encodi}

The different topologies described in [Section 3](#sect-3){.xref} create
different SSRC distribution models and RTP stream multiplexing
points.[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

Most video conferencing systems today can separate multiple RTP sources
by placing them into RTP sessions using the SDP description; the video
conferencing application can also have some knowledge about the purpose
of each RTP session. For example, video conferencing applications that
have a primary video source and a slides video source can send each
media source in a separate RTP session with a content attribute
\[[RFC4796](#RFC4796){.xref}\], enabling different application behavior
for each received RTP media source. Demultiplexing is straightforward
because each Media Capture is sent as a single RTP stream, with each RTP
stream being sent in a separate RTP session, on a distinct UDP 5-tuple.
This will also be true for mapping the RTP streams to Capture Encodings,
if each Capture Encoding uses a separate RTP session and the consumer
can identify it based on the receiving RTP port. In this case, SDP only
needs to label the RTP session with an identifier that can be used to
identify the Media Capture in the CLUE description. The SDP label
attribute serves as this identifier.[¶](#section-4-2){.pilcrow}

Each Capture Encoding [MUST]{.bcp14} be sent as a separate RTP stream.
CLUE endpoints [MUST]{.bcp14} support sending each such RTP stream in a
separate RTP session signaled by an SDP \"m=\" line. They [MAY]{.bcp14}
also support sending some or all of the RTP streams in a single RTP
session, using the mechanism described in \[[RFC8843](#RFC8843){.xref}\]
to relate RTP streams to SDP \"m=\" lines.[¶](#section-4-3){.pilcrow}

MCCs bring another mapping issue, in that an MCC represents multiple
Media Captures that can be sent as part of the MCC if configured by the
consumer. When receiving an RTP stream that is mapped to the MCC, the
consumer needs to know which original MC it is in order to get the MC
parameters from the advertisement. If a consumer requested a MCC, the
original MC does not have a Capture Encoding, so it cannot be associated
with an \"m=\" line using a label as described in \"CLUE Signaling\"
\[[RFC8848](#RFC8848){.xref}\]. It is important, for example, to get
correct scaling information for the original MC, which may be different
for the various MCs that are contributing to the
MCC.[¶](#section-4-4){.pilcrow}

## [5.](#section-5){.section-number .selfRef} [MCC Constituent CaptureID Definition](#name-mcc-constituent-captureid-d){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-mcc-constituent-captureid-d}

For an MCC that can represent multiple switched MCs, there is a need to
know which MC is represented in the current RTP stream at any given
time. This requires a mapping from the SSRC of the RTP stream conveying
a particular MCC to the constituent MC. In order to address this
mapping, this document defines an RTP header extension and SDES item
that includes the captureID of the original MC, allowing the consumer to
use the MC\'s original source attributes like the spatial
information.[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

This mapping temporarily associates the SSRC of the RTP stream conveying
a particular MCC with the captureID of the single original MC that is
currently switched into the MCC. This mapping cannot be used for a
composed case where more than one original MC is composed into the MCC
simultaneously.[¶](#section-5-2){.pilcrow}

If there is only one MC in the MCC, then the media provider
[MUST]{.bcp14} send the captureID of the current constituent MC in the
RTP header extension and as an RTCP CaptureID SDES item. When the media
provider switches the MC it sends within an MCC, it [MUST]{.bcp14} send
the captureID value for the MC that just switched into the MCC in an RTP
header extension and as an RTCP CaptureID SDES item as specified in
\[[RFC7941](#RFC7941){.xref}\].[¶](#section-5-3){.pilcrow}

If there is more than one MC composed into the MCC, then the media
provider [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} send any of the MCs\' captureIDs using this
mechanism. However, if an MCC is sending Contributing Source (CSRC)
information in the RTP header for a composed capture, it [MAY]{.bcp14}
send the captureID values in the RTCP SDES packets giving source
information for the SSRC values sent as
CSRCs.[¶](#section-5-4){.pilcrow}

If the media provider sends the captureID of a single MC switched into
an MCC, then later sends one composed stream of multiple MCs in the same
MCC, it [MUST]{.bcp14} send the special value \"-\", a single-dash
character, as the captureID RTP header extension and RTCP CaptureID SDES
item. The single-dash character indicates there is no applicable value
for the MCC constituent CaptureID. The media consumer interprets this as
meaning that any previous CaptureID value associated with this SSRC no
longer applies. As \[[RFC8846](#RFC8846){.xref}\] defines the captureID
syntax as \"xs:ID\", the single-dash character is not a legal captureID
value, so there is no possibility of confusing it with an actual
captureID.[¶](#section-5-5){.pilcrow}

This CaptureID is a variable-length UTF-8 string corresponding to either
a CaptureID negotiated in the CLUE protocol or the single character

This SDES item [MUST]{.bcp14} be sent in an SDES packet within a
compound RTCP packet unless support for Reduced-Size RTCP has been
negotiated as specified in RFC 5506 \[[RFC5506](#RFC5506){.xref}\], in

The CaptureID is also carried in an RTP header extension
\[[RFC8285](#RFC8285){.xref}\], using the mechanism defined in
\[[RFC7941](#RFC7941){.xref}\].[¶](#section-5.2-1){.pilcrow}

Support is negotiated within SDP using the URN
\"urn:ietf:params:rtp-hdrext:sdes:CaptureID\".[¶](#section-5.2-2){.pilcrow}

The CaptureID is sent in an RTP header extension because for switched
captures, receivers need to know which original MC corresponds to the
media being sent for an MCC, in order to correctly apply geometric
adjustments to the received media.[¶](#section-5.2-3){.pilcrow}

As discussed in \[[RFC7941](#RFC7941){.xref}\], there is no need to send
the CaptId Header Extension with all RTP packets. Senders [MAY]{.bcp14}
choose to send it only when a new MC is sent. If such a mode is being
used, the header extension [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be sent in the first few RTP
packets to reduce the risk of losing it due to packet loss. See
\[[RFC7941](#RFC7941){.xref}\] for further
discussion.[¶](#section-5.2-4){.pilcrow}

## [9.](#section-9){.section-number .selfRef} [Security Considerations](#name-security-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-security-considerations}

The security considerations of the RTP specification, the RTP/SAVPF
profile, and the various RTP/RTCP extensions and RTP payload formats
that form the complete protocol suite described in this memo apply. It
is believed that there are no new security considerations resulting from
the combination of these various protocol
extensions.[¶](#section-9-1){.pilcrow}

The \"Extended Secure RTP Profile for Real-time Transport Control
Protocol (RTCP)-Based Feedback (RTP/SAVPF)\" document
\[[RFC5124](#RFC5124){.xref}\] provides the handling of fundamental
issues by offering confidentiality, integrity, and partial source
authentication. A mandatory-to-implement and use media security solution
is created by combining this secured RTP profile and DTLS-SRTP keying
\[[RFC5764](#RFC5764){.xref}\] as defined in the communication security
section of this memo ([Section
7](#sect-7){.xref}).[¶](#section-9-2){.pilcrow}

RTCP packets convey a CNAME identifier that is used to associate RTP
packet streams that need to be synchronized across related RTP sessions.
Inappropriate choice of CNAME values can be a privacy concern, since
long-term persistent CNAME identifiers can be used to track users across
multiple calls. The communication security section of this memo
([Section 7](#sect-7){.xref}) mandates the generation of short- term
persistent RTCP CNAMEs, as specified in \[[RFC7022](#RFC7022){.xref}\],
so they can\'t be used for long-term tracking of the
users.[¶](#section-9-3){.pilcrow}

Some potential denial-of-service attacks exist if the RTCP reporting
interval is configured to an inappropriate value. This could be done by
configuring the RTCP bandwidth fraction to an excessively large or small
value using the SDP \"b=RR:\" or \"b=RS:\" lines
\[[RFC3556](#RFC3556){.xref}\], or some similar mechanism, or by
choosing an excessively large or small value for the RTP/AVPF minimal
receiver report interval (if using SDP, this is the \"a=rtcp-fb:\...
trr-int\" parameter) \[[RFC4585](#RFC4585){.xref}\]. The risks are as
follows:[¶](#section-9-4){.pilcrow}

1.  [The RTCP bandwidth could be configured to make the regular
    reporting interval so large that effective congestion control cannot
    be maintained, potentially leading to denial of service due to
    congestion caused by the media
    traffic;[¶](#section-9-5.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-9-5.1}
2.  [The RTCP interval could be configured to a very small value,
    causing endpoints to generate high-rate RTCP traffic, which
    potentially leads to denial of service due to the
    non-congestion-controlled RTCP traffic;
    and[¶](#section-9-5.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-9-5.2}
3.  [RTCP parameters could be configured differently for each endpoint,
    with some of the endpoints using a large reporting interval and some
    using a smaller interval, leading to denial of service due to
    premature participant timeouts, which are due to mismatched timeout
    periods that are based on the reporting interval (this is a
    particular concern if endpoints use a small but non-zero value for
    the RTP/AVPF minimal receiver report interval (trr-int)
    \[[RFC4585](#RFC4585){.xref}\], as discussed in
    \[[RFC8108](#RFC8108){.xref}\]).[¶](#section-9-5.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-9-5.3}

Premature participant timeout can be avoided by using the fixed (non-
reduced) minimum interval when calculating the participant timeout
\[[RFC8108](#RFC8108){.xref}\]. To address the other concerns, endpoints
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} ignore parameters that configure the RTCP reporting
interval to be significantly longer than the default five-second
interval specified in \[[RFC3550](#RFC3550){.xref}\] (unless the media
data rate is so low that the longer reporting interval roughly
corresponds to 5% of the media data rate) or that configure the RTCP
reporting interval small enough that the RTCP bandwidth would exceed the
media bandwidth.[¶](#section-9-6){.pilcrow}

The guidelines in \[[RFC6562](#RFC6562){.xref}\] apply when using
variable bit rate (VBR) audio codecs such as
Opus.[¶](#section-9-7){.pilcrow}

Encryption of the header extensions is [RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14}, unless
there are known reasons, like RTP middleboxes performing
voice-activity-based source selection or third-party monitoring that
will greatly benefit from the information, and this has been expressed
using API or signaling. If further evidence is produced to show that
information leakage is significant from audio level indications, then
the use of encryption needs to be mandated at that
time.[¶](#section-9-8){.pilcrow}

In multi-party communication scenarios using RTP middleboxes, the
middleboxes are [REQUIRED]{.bcp14}, by this protocol, to not weaken the
sessions\' security. The middlebox [SHOULD]{.bcp14} maintain
confidentiality, maintain integrity, and perform source authentication.
The middlebox [MAY]{.bcp14} perform checks that prevent any endpoint
participating in a conference to impersonate another. Some additional
security considerations regarding multi-party topologies can be found in
\[[RFC7667](#RFC7667){.xref}\].[¶](#section-9-9){.pilcrow}

The CaptureID is created as part of the CLUE protocol. The CaptId SDES
item is used to convey the same CaptureID value in the SDES item. When
sending the SDES item, the security considerations specified in [Section
6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7941#section-6){.relref} of
\[[RFC7941](#RFC7941){.xref}\] and in the communication security section
of this memo (see [Section 7](#sect-7){.xref}) are applicable. Note that
since the CaptureID is also carried in CLUE protocol messages, it is
[RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14} that this SDES item use at least similar
protection profiles as the CLUE protocol messages carried in the CLUE
data channel.[¶](#section-9-10){.pilcrow}
