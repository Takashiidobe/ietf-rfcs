# Bioctal: Hexadecimal 2.0 {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

The prevailing hexadecimal system was chosen for congruence with groups
of four binary digits, but its design exhibits an indifference to
cognitive factors. An alternative is introduced that is designed to
reduce brain cycles in cases where a hexadecimal number should be
readily convertible to binary by a human
being.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

Octal has long been used to represent groups of three binary digits as
single characters, and that system has the considerable merit of not
requiring any digits other than those already familiar from decimal
numbers. Unfortunately, the increasing use of 16-bit machines and other
machines that have word lengths that are evenly divisible by four (but
not by three) has led to the widespread adoption of hexadecimal. [Table
1](#hex_alpha){.xref} presents the digits of the hexadecimal
alphabet.[¶](#section-1.1-1){.pilcrow}

The choice of alphabet is clearly arbitrary: On the exhaustion of the
decimal digits, the first letters of the Latin alphabet are used in
sequence for the remaining hexadecimal digits. An arbitrary alphabet may
be acceptable on an interim or experimental basis. However, given the
diminishing likelihood of a return to 18-bit computing, a review of this
choice of alphabet is merited before its use, like that of the QWERTY
keyboard, becomes too deeply established to permit the easy adoption of
a more logical alternative.[¶](#section-1.1-3){.pilcrow}

### [1.2.](#section-1.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Problems with Hexadecimal](#name-problems-with-hexadecimal){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-problems-with-hexadecimal}

One problem with the hexadecimal alphabet is well known: It contains two
vowels, and numbers expressed in hexadecimal have been found to collide
with words offensive to vegetarians and other
groups.[¶](#section-1.2-1){.pilcrow}

Imposing a greater constraint on the solution space, however, is the
difficulty of mentally converting a number expressed in hexadecimal to
(or from) binary. Consider the hexadecimal digit \'D\', for example.
First, one must remember that \'D\' represents a value of 13 \-- and,
while it may be easy to recall that \'F\' is 15 with all bits set, for
digits in the middle of the non-decimal range, such as \'C\' and \'D\',
one may resort to counting (\"A is ten, B is eleven, \...\"). Next, one
must subtract eight from that number to arrive at a number that is in
the octal range. Thus, the benefit of representing one additional bit
incurs the cost of two additional mental operations before one arrives
at the position where the task that remains reduces to the difficulty of
converting the remaining three digits to
binary.[¶](#section-1.2-2){.pilcrow}

These mental steps are not difficult per se, since a child could do
them, but if it is possible to avoid employing children, then it should
be avoided. An appeal to the authority of cognitive psychology is
perhaps also due here, in particular to the \"seven plus or minus two\"
principle \[[Miller](#Miller){.xref}\] \-- either because octal is
within the upper end of that range (nine) and hexadecimal is not, or
else because the difference in the size of the alphabets is greater than
the lower end of that range (five). Either way, it is almost certainly
relevant.[¶](#section-1.2-3){.pilcrow}

### [1.3.](#section-1.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Other Proposals](#name-other-proposals){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-other-proposals}

Various alternatives have already been suggested. Some of these are
equally arbitrary, e.g., in selecting the last six letters of the Latin
alphabet rather than the first six letters.[¶](#section-1.3-1){.pilcrow}

The scheme that comes closest to solving the main problem to date is
described by Bruce A. Martin \[[Martin](#Martin){.xref}\] who proposes
new characters for the entire octal alphabet. While his principal
motivation is to distinguish hexadecimal numbers from decimals, the
design of each character uses horizontal lines to directly represent the
\"ones\" of the corresponding binary number, making mental translation
to binary a trivial task.[¶](#section-1.3-2){.pilcrow}

Unfortunately for this and other proposals involving new symbols,
proposals to change the US-ASCII character set
\[[USASCII](#USASCII){.xref}\] might no longer be accepted. Also, it
seems unrealistic to expect keyboards or printer type elements (whether
of the golf ball or daisy wheel kind) to be replaced to accommodate new
character designs.[¶](#section-1.3-3){.pilcrow}

[Table 2](#hex_seq_octaves){.xref} presents the hexadecimal alphabet
once again, this time in a sequence of two octaves with values
increasing left to right and top to bottom.[¶](#section-2-1){.pilcrow}

Arranged thus, the binary representation of each digit in the second
octave is the same as the digit above it, but with the most significant
of the four bits set to \'1\' instead of
\'0\'.[¶](#section-2-3){.pilcrow}

The incongruity of two decimal digits in the second octave also suggests
that, in blindly aligning with four bits, hexadecimal (six plus ten,
neither of which are powers of two) misses an opportunity to align also
with three bits.[¶](#section-2-4){.pilcrow}

Bioctal restores congruence by replacing the second row with characters
mnemonically related to the corresponding character in the first
octave.[¶](#section-2-5){.pilcrow}

[Table 3](#bioctal_seq_octaves){.xref} shows the compelling
result.[¶](#section-2-6){.pilcrow}

[]{#name-bioctal-in-sequential-octav}

  : [Table 3](#table-3){.selfRef}: [Bioctal in Sequential
  Octaves](#name-bioctal-in-sequential-octav){.selfRef}
:::

The mnemonic basis is the shape of the lowercase character. This is seen
directly for \'2\', \'5\', and \'6\'. For \'3\', \'4\', and \'7\', the
corresponding letters are the result of a quarter-turn clockwise
(assuming an \"open\" \'4\'). The choice of \'c\' and \'j\' for \'0\'
and \'1\' avoids vowels and lowercase \'L\', the latter being confusable
with \'1\' in some fonts.[¶](#section-2-8){.pilcrow}

With this choice of letters, it is immediately evident that both
problems with hexadecimal are solved. Mental conversion is now
straightforward: if the digit is a letter, then the most significant of
the four binary bits is \'1\', and the remaining three bits are the same
as for the Arabic numeral with the same shape in the first
octave.[¶](#section-2-9){.pilcrow}

Several objections can be anticipated, the first of which concerns the
name. The term \"bioctal\" is already used to refer to the combination
of two octal characters into a single field on, for example, paper tape
(e.g., \[[UNIVAC](#UNIVAC){.xref}\]). However, if the word \"bioctal\"
must be disadvantaged relative to words such as \"biannual\" in the
number of meanings it is allowed to have, then it is the paper tapers
who must give way: in that context, the \"octal\" part of \"bioctal\"
refers to the number of distinct values that three bits can have, while
the \"bi\" refers to a doubling of the number of bits, not values. A
meaning depending on such a discordant etymology does not deserve to
endure.[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

Second, it may be argued that the use of hexadecimal has already become
too entrenched to be changed in the short term: Bioctal should be
introduced only after those working in the industry who have grown
accustomed to hexadecimal have retired. Such a dilatory contention
cannot be allowed to impede the march of progress. Instead, any data
entry technician who claims to have difficulty with bioctal may be
reassigned to duties involving only binary
numbers.[¶](#section-3-2){.pilcrow}

A third possible objection is that numbers in bioctal do not sort
numerically. However, this assumes a sort based on the US-ASCII order of
symbols; it is quite possible that bioctal numbers sort naturally in
some lesser known variety of EBCDIC. Further, resistance to numeric
sorting may be an indicator of virtue, being suggestive of an alphabet
with a certain strength of character.[¶](#section-3-3){.pilcrow}

One difficulty remains: Not all computers support lowercase letters.
While this is indeed true, it should be confirmed in any particular
instance: the author has observed that in many cases a machine having a
keyboard with buttons marked only with uppercase letters also supports
lowercase letters. In any case, it is permissible to use uppercase
letters instead of the lowercase ones of [Table
3](#bioctal_seq_octaves){.xref}; the morphology mnemonic continues to
work for most bioctal digits in uppercase, although an extra mental
cycle is required for \'B\'.[¶](#section-3-4){.pilcrow}

The letters \'b\' and \'f\' appear in both the bioctal and hexadecimal
alphabets, which makes potential misinterpretation a concern. A case of
particular hazard arises where two embedded systems engineers work to
develop a miniature lizard detector designed to be worn like a
wristwatch. One engineer works on the lizard proximity sensor and the
other on a minimal two-character display. The interface between the
circuits is 14 bits. To make things easier, the engineer working on the
display arranges for these bits to be set in a pattern that allows them
to be used directly as two seven-bit US-ASCII characters indicating the
most significant lacertilian species detected in the vicinity of the
device. Due to the use of an old US-ASCII table (i.e., one in hex, not
bioctal) and human error, some of the values specified as outputs for
the detection subsystem are in hexadecimal, not the bioctal the engineer
developing that subsystem expects \-- including, in the case of one type
of lizard, \"4b 4f\". The result is that the detector displays \"NL\"
(No Lizards) when it should display \"KO\" (Komodo dragon). This may be
considered prejudicial to the security of the user of the
device.[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

Extensive research has uncovered no other security-related scenarios to
date.[¶](#section-4-2){.pilcrow}

Bioctal is a significant advance over hexadecimal technology and
promises to reduce the small (but assuredly non-zero) contribution to
anthropogenic global warming of mental hex-to-binary conversions. Since
the mnemonic basis of the alphabet is independent of English or any
other particular natural language, there is no reason that it should not
be adopted immediately around the world, excepting perhaps certain
islands of Indonesia to which *Varanus komodoensis* is
native.[¶](#section-6-1){.pilcrow}
