# RFC 8657 {#rfcnum}

# Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) Record Extensions for Account URI and Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) Method Binding {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

The Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) DNS record allows a
domain to communicate an issuance policy to Certification Authorities
(CAs) but only allows a domain to define a policy with CA-level
granularity. However, the CAA specification (RFC 8659) also provides
facilities for an extension to admit a more granular, CA-specific
policy. This specification defines two such parameters: one allowing
specific accounts of a CA to be identified by URIs and one allowing
specific methods of domain control validation as defined by the
Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) protocol to be
required.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

This specification defines two parameters for the \"issue\" and
\"issuewild\" Properties of the Certification Authority Authorization
(CAA) DNS resource record \[[RFC8659](#RFC8659){.xref}\]. The first,
\"accounturi\", allows authorization conferred by a CAA policy to be
restricted to specific accounts of a Certification Authority (CA), which
are identified by URIs. The second, \"validationmethods\", allows the
set of validation methods supported by a CA to validate domain control
to be limited to a subset of the full set of methods that it
supports.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

This document defines the \"accounturi\" CAA parameter for the \"issue\"
and \"issuewild\" Properties defined by \[[RFC8659](#RFC8659){.xref}\].
The value of this parameter, if specified, [MUST]{.bcp14} be a URI
\[[RFC3986](#RFC3986){.xref}\] identifying a specific CA
account.[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

\"CA account\" means an object that is maintained by a specific CA, that
may request the issuance of certificates, and that represents a specific
entity or group of related entities.[¶](#section-3-2){.pilcrow}

The presence of this parameter constrains the Property to which it is
attached. Where a CAA Property has an \"accounturi\" parameter, a CA
[MUST]{.bcp14} only consider that Property to authorize issuance in the
context of a given certificate issuance request if the CA recognizes the
URI specified in the value portion of that parameter as identifying the
account making that request.[¶](#section-3-3){.pilcrow}

A Property without an \"accounturi\" parameter matches any account. A
Property with an invalid or unrecognized \"accounturi\" parameter is
unsatisfiable. A Property with multiple \"accounturi\" parameters is
unsatisfiable.[¶](#section-3-4){.pilcrow}

The presence of an \"accounturi\" parameter does not replace or
supersede the need to validate the domain name specified in an \"issue\"
or \"issuewild\" record in the manner described in the CAA specification
\[[RFC8659](#RFC8659){.xref}\]. CAs [MUST]{.bcp14} still perform such
validation. For example, a CAA \"issue\" Property that specifies a
domain name belonging to CA A and an \"accounturi\" parameter
identifying an account at CA B is
unsatisfiable.[¶](#section-3-5){.pilcrow}

An Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME)
\[[RFC8555](#RFC8555){.xref}\] account object [MAY]{.bcp14} be
identified by setting the \"accounturi\" parameter to the URI of the
ACME account object.[¶](#section-3.1-1){.pilcrow}

The \"accounturi\" specification provides a general mechanism to
identify entities that may request certificate issuance via URIs. The
use of specific kinds of URIs may be specified in future RFCs, and CAs
not implementing ACME [MAY]{.bcp14} assign and recognize their own URIs
arbitrarily.[¶](#section-3.2-1){.pilcrow}

This document also defines the \"validationmethods\" CAA parameter for
the \"issue\" and \"issuewild\" Properties. The value of this parameter,
if specified, [MUST]{.bcp14} be a comma-separated string of zero or more
validation method labels.[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

A validation method label identifies a validation method. A validation
method is a particular way in which a CA can validate control over a
domain.[¶](#section-4-2){.pilcrow}

The presence of this parameter constrains the Property to which it is
attached. A CA [MUST]{.bcp14} only consider a Property with the
\"validationmethods\" parameter to authorize issuance where the
validation method being used is identified by one of the validation
method labels listed in the comma-separated
list.[¶](#section-4-3){.pilcrow}

Each validation method label [MUST]{.bcp14} be either the label of a
method defined in the \"ACME Validation Methods\" IANA registry
\[[RFC8555](#RFC8555){.xref}\] or a CA‑specific non-ACME validation
method label as defined below.[¶](#section-4-4){.pilcrow}

Where a CA supports both the \"validationmethods\" parameter and one or
more non-ACME validation methods, it [MUST]{.bcp14} assign labels to
those methods. If appropriate non-ACME labels are not present in the
\"ACME Validation Methods\" IANA registry, the CA [MUST]{.bcp14} use
labels beginning with the string \"ca-\", which are defined to have
CA-specific meaning.[¶](#section-4-5){.pilcrow}

The value of the \"validationmethods\" parameter [MUST]{.bcp14} comply
with the following ABNF

## [5.](#section-5){.section-number .selfRef} [Security Considerations](#name-security-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-security-considerations}

This specification describes an extension to the CAA record
specification, increasing the granularity at which a CAA policy can be
expressed. This allows the set of entities capable of successfully
requesting issuance of certificates for a given domain to be restricted
beyond the set of entities would otherwise be possible, while still
allowing issuance for specific accounts of a CA. This improves the
security of issuance for domains that choose to employ it, when combined
with a CA that implements this specification.[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

::: {#limited-to-cas-processing-caa-records}
::: {#section-5.1 .section}
### [5.1.](#section-5.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Limited to CAs Processing CAA Records](#name-limited-to-cas-processing-c){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-limited-to-cas-processing-c}

All of the security considerations listed in
\[[RFC8659](#RFC8659){.xref}\] are inherited by this document. This
specification merely enables a domain with an existing relationship with
a CA to further constrain that CA in its issuance practices, where that
CA implements this specification. In particular, it provides no
additional security above that provided by using the unextended CAA
specification alone as concerns matters relating to any other CA. The
capacity of any other CA to issue certificates for the given domain is
completely unchanged.[¶](#section-5.1-1){.pilcrow}

As such, a domain that, via CAA records, authorizes only CAs adopting
this specification and that constrains its policy by means of this
specification, remains vulnerable to unauthorized issuance by CAs that
do not honor CAA records or that honor them only on an advisory basis.
Where a domain uses DNSSEC, it also remains vulnerable to CAs that honor
CAA records but that do not validate CAA records by means of a trusted
DNSSEC-validating resolver.[¶](#section-5.1-2){.pilcrow}

### [5.2.](#section-5.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Restrictions Ineffective without CA Recognition](#name-restrictions-ineffective-wi){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-restrictions-ineffective-wi}

Because the parameters of \"issue\" or \"issuewild\" CAA Properties
constitute a CA-specific namespace, the CA identified by an \"issue\" or
\"issuewild\" Property decides what parameters to recognize and their
semantics. Accordingly, the CAA parameters defined in this specification
rely on their being recognized by the CA named by an \"issue\" or
\"issuewild\" CAA Property and are not an effective means of control
over issuance unless a CA\'s support for the parameters is established
beforehand.[¶](#section-5.2-1){.pilcrow}

CAs that implement this specification [SHOULD]{.bcp14} make available
documentation indicating as such, including explicit statements as to
which parameters are supported. Domains configuring CAA records for a CA
[MUST NOT]{.bcp14} assume that the restrictions implied by the
\"accounturi\" and \"validationmethods\" parameters are effective in the
absence of explicit indication as such from that
CA.[¶](#section-5.2-2){.pilcrow}

CAs [SHOULD]{.bcp14} also document whether they implement DNSSEC
validation for DNS lookups done for validation purposes, as this affects
the security of the \"accounturi\" and \"validationmethods\"
parameters.[¶](#section-5.2-3){.pilcrow}

### [5.3.](#section-5.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Mandatory Consistency in CA Recognition](#name-mandatory-consistency-in-ca){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-mandatory-consistency-in-ca}

A CA [MUST]{.bcp14} ensure that its support for the \"accounturi\" and
\"validationmethods\" parameters is fully consistent for a given domain
name that a CA recognizes as identifying itself in a CAA \"issue\" or
\"issuewild\" Property. If a CA has multiple issuance systems (for
example, an ACME-based issuance system and a non-ACME-based issuance
system, or two different issuance systems resulting from a corporate
merger), it [MUST]{.bcp14} ensure that all issuance systems recognize
the same parameters.[¶](#section-5.3-1){.pilcrow}

A CA that is unable to do this [MAY]{.bcp14} still implement the
parameters by splitting the CA into two domain names for the purposes of
CAA processing. For example, a CA \"example.com\" with an ACME-based
issuance system and a non-ACME-based issuance system could recognize
only \"acme.example.com\" for the former and \"example.com\" for the
latter, and then implement support for the \"accounturi\" and
\"validationmethods\" parameters for \"acme.example.com\"
only.[¶](#section-5.3-2){.pilcrow}

A CA that is unable to ensure consistent processing of the
\"accounturi\" parameter or the \"validationmethods\" parameter for a
given CA domain name as specifiable in CAA \"issue\" or \"issuewild\"
Properties [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} implement support for these parameters.
Failure to do so would result in an implementation of these parameters
that does not provide effective security.[¶](#section-5.3-3){.pilcrow}

### [5.4.](#section-5.4){.section-number .selfRef} [URI Ambiguity](#name-uri-ambiguity){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-uri-ambiguity}

Suppose that CA A recognizes \"a.example.com\" as identifying itself and
CA B is a subsidiary of CA A that recognizes both \"a.example.com\" and
\"b.example.com\" as identifying itself.[¶](#section-5.4-1){.pilcrow}

Suppose that both CA A and CA B issue account URIs of the
form:[¶](#section-5.4-2){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-5.4-3 .artwork .art-text .alignLeft}
       "urn:example:account-id:1234" 

[¶](#section-5.4-3){.pilcrow}
:::

If the CA domain name in a CAA record is specified as \"a.example.com\",
then this could be construed as identifying account number 1234 at CA A
or at CA B. These may be different accounts, creating
ambiguity.[¶](#section-5.4-4){.pilcrow}

Thus, CAs [MUST]{.bcp14} ensure that the URIs they recognize as
pertaining to a specific account of that CA are unique within the scope
of all domain names that they recognize as identifying that CA for the
purpose of CAA record validation.[¶](#section-5.4-5){.pilcrow}

CAs [SHOULD]{.bcp14} satisfy this requirement by using URIs that include
an authority (see [Section

### [5.5.](#section-5.5){.section-number .selfRef} [Authorization Freshness](#name-authorization-freshness){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-authorization-freshness}

The CAA specification \[[RFC8659](#RFC8659){.xref}\] governs the act of
issuance by a CA. In some cases, a CA may establish authorization for an
account to request certificate issuance for a specific domain separately
from the act of issuance itself. Such authorization may occur
substantially prior to a certificate issuance request. The CAA policy
expressed by a domain may have changed in the meantime, creating the
risk that a CA will issue certificates in a manner inconsistent with the
presently published CAA policy.[¶](#section-5.5-1){.pilcrow}

CAs [SHOULD]{.bcp14} adopt practices to reduce the risk of such
circumstances. Possible countermeasures include issuing authorizations
with very limited validity periods, such as an hour, or revalidating the
CAA policy for a domain at certificate issuance
time.[¶](#section-5.5-2){.pilcrow}

The \"domain validation\" model of validation commonly used for
certificate issuance cannot ordinarily protect against adversaries who
can conduct global man-in-the-middle attacks against a particular
domain. A global man-in-the-middle attack is an attack that can
intercept traffic to or from a given domain, regardless of the origin or
destination of that traffic. Such an adversary can intercept all
validation traffic initiated by a CA and thus appear to have control of
the given domain.[¶](#section-5.6-1){.pilcrow}

Where a domain is signed using DNSSEC, the authenticity of its DNS data
can be assured, providing that a given CA makes all DNS resolutions via
a trusted DNSSEC-validating resolver. A domain can use this Property to
protect itself from the threat posed by an adversary capable of
performing a global man-in-the-middle attack against that
domain.[¶](#section-5.6-2){.pilcrow}

In order to facilitate this, a CA validation process must either rely
solely on information obtained via DNSSEC or meaningfully bind the other
parts of the validation transaction using material obtained via
DNSSEC.[¶](#section-5.6-3){.pilcrow}

The CAA parameters described in this specification can be used to ensure
that only validation methods meeting these criteria are used. In
particular, a domain secured via DNSSEC [SHOULD]{.bcp14}
either:[¶](#section-5.6-4){.pilcrow}

1.  [Use the \"accounturi\" parameter to ensure that only accounts that
    it controls are authorized to obtain certificates,
    or[¶](#section-5.6-5.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.6-5.1}
2.  [Exclusively use validation methods that rely solely on information
    obtained via DNSSEC and use the \"validationmethods\" parameter to
    ensure that only such methods are
    used.[¶](#section-5.6-5.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.6-5.2}

A CA supporting the \"accounturi\" parameter or the
\"validationmethods\" parameter [MUST]{.bcp14} perform CAA validation
using a trusted DNSSEC‑validating resolver.[¶](#section-5.6-6){.pilcrow}

\"Trusted\" in this context means that the CA both trusts the resolver
itself and ensures that the communications path between the resolver and
the system performing CAA validation is secure. It is
[RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14} that a CA ensure this by using a DNSSEC-validating
resolver running on the same machine as the system performing CAA
validation.[¶](#section-5.6-7){.pilcrow}

The use of the \"accounturi\" parameter or the \"validationmethods\"
parameter does not confer additional security against an attacker
capable of performing a man-in-the-middle attack against all validation
attempts made by a given CA that is authorized by CAA
where:[¶](#section-5.6-8){.pilcrow}

1.  [A domain does not secure its nameservers using DNSSEC,
    or[¶](#section-5.6-9.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-5.6-9.1}
2.  [That CA does not perform CAA validation using a trusted
    DNSSEC‑validating

Moreover, the use of the \"accounturi\" parameter or the
\"validationmethods\" parameter does not mitigate man-in-the-middle
attacks against CAs that do not validate CAA records or that do not do
so using a trusted DNSSEC-validating resolver, regardless of whether or
not those CAs are authorized by CAA; see [Section
5.1](#limited-to-cas-processing-caa-records){.xref}.[¶](#section-5.6-10){.pilcrow}

In these cases, the \"accounturi\" and \"validationmethods\" parameters
still provide an effective means of administrative control over
issuance, except where control over DNS is subdelegated (see
below).[¶](#section-5.6-11){.pilcrow}

CAA records are located during validation by walking up the DNS
hierarchy until one or more records are found. CAA records are therefore
not an effective way of restricting or controlling issuance for
subdomains of a domain, where control over those subdomains is delegated
to another party (such as via DNS delegation or by providing limited
access to manage subdomain DNS records).[¶](#section-5.7-1){.pilcrow}

Because the \"accounturi\" and \"validationmethods\" parameters express
restrictive security policies, misconfiguration of said parameters may
result in legitimate issuance requests being
refused.[¶](#section-5.8-1){.pilcrow}

Because CAA records are publicly accessible, the use of the
\"accounturi\" parameter enables third parties to observe the authorized
account URIs for a domain. This may allow third parties to identify a
correlation between domains if those domains use the same account
URIs.[¶](#section-5.9-1){.pilcrow}

CAs are encouraged to select and process account URIs under the
assumption that untrusted third parties may learn of
them.[¶](#section-5.9-2){.pilcrow}

This document has no IANA actions. As per
\[[RFC8659](#RFC8659){.xref}\], the parameter namespace for the CAA
\"issue\" and \"issuewild\" Properties has CA-defined semantics, and the
identifiers within that namespace may be freely and arbitrarily assigned
by a CA. This document merely specifies recommended semantics for
parameters of the names \"accounturi\" and \"validationmethods\", which
CAs may choose to adopt.[¶](#section-6-1){.pilcrow}
