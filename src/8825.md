# RFC 8825 {#rfcnum}

# Overview: Real-Time Protocols for Browser-Based Applications {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

This document gives an overview and context of a protocol suite intended
for use with real-time applications that can be deployed in browsers \--
\"real-time communication on the
Web\".[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

It intends to serve as a starting and coordination point to make sure
that (1) all the parts that are needed to achieve this goal are findable
and (2) the parts that belong in the Internet protocol suite are fully
specified and on the right publication
track.[¶](#section-abstract-2){.pilcrow}

This document is an applicability statement \-- it does not itself
specify any protocol, but it specifies which other specifications
implementations are supposed to follow to be compliant with Web
Real-Time Communication (WebRTC).[¶](#section-abstract-3){.pilcrow}

## [1.](#section-1){.section-number .selfRef} [Introduction](#name-introduction){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-introduction}

The Internet was, from very early in its lifetime, considered a possible
vehicle for the deployment of real-time, interactive applications \--
with the most easily imaginable being audio conversations (aka
\"Internet telephony\") and video
conferencing.[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

The first attempts to build such applications were dependent on special
networks, special hardware, and custom-built software, often at very
high prices or of low quality, placing great demands on the
infrastructure.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

As the available bandwidth has increased, and as processors and other
hardware have become ever faster, the barriers to participation have
decreased, and it has become possible to deliver a satisfactory
experience on commonly available computing
hardware.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

Still, there are a number of barriers to the ability to communicate
universally \-- one of these is that there is, as of yet, no single set
of communication protocols that all agree should be made available for
communication; another is the sheer lack of universal identification
systems (such as is served by telephone numbers or email addresses in
other communications systems).[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

Development of \"The Universal Solution\" has, however, proved
hard.[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}

The last few years have also seen a new platform rise for deployment of
services: the browser-embedded application, or \"web application\". It
turns out that as long as the browser platform has the necessary
interfaces, it is possible to deliver almost any kind of service
on it.[¶](#section-1-6){.pilcrow}

Traditionally, these interfaces have been delivered by plugins, which
had to be downloaded and installed separately from the browser; in the
development of HTML5 \[[HTML5](#HTML5){.xref}\], application developers
see much promise in the possibility of making those interfaces available
in a standardized way within the browser.[¶](#section-1-7){.pilcrow}

This memo describes a set of building blocks that (1) can be made
accessible and controllable through a JavaScript API in a browser and
(2) together form a sufficient set of functions to allow the use of
interactive audio and video in applications that communicate directly
between browsers across the Internet. The resulting protocol suite is
intended to enable all the applications that are described as required
scenarios in the WebRTC \"use cases\" document
\[[RFC7478](#RFC7478){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-8){.pilcrow}

Other efforts \-- for instance, the W3C Web Real-Time Communications,
Web Applications Security, and Devices and Sensors Working Groups \--
focus on making standardized APIs and interfaces available, within or
alongside the HTML5 effort, for those functions. This memo concentrates
on specifying the protocols and subprotocols that are needed to specify
the interactions over the network.[¶](#section-1-9){.pilcrow}

Operators should note that deployment of WebRTC will result in a change
in the nature of signaling for real-time media on the network and may
result in a shift in the kinds of devices used to create and consume
such media. In the case of signaling, WebRTC session setup will
typically occur over TLS-secured web technologies using
application-specific protocols. Operational techniques that involve
inserting network elements to interpret the Session Description Protocol
(SDP) \-- through either (1) the endpoint asking the network for a SIP
server \[[RFC3361](#RFC3361){.xref}\] or (2) the transparent insertion
of SIP Application Layer Gateways (ALGs) \-- will not work with such
signaling. In the case of networks using cooperative endpoints, the
approaches defined in \[[RFC8155](#RFC8155){.xref}\] may serve as a
suitable replacement for \[[RFC3361](#RFC3361){.xref}\]. The increase in
browser-based communications may also lead to a shift away from
dedicated real-time-communications hardware, such as SIP desk phones.
This will diminish the efficacy of operational techniques that place
dedicated real-time devices on their own network segment, address range,
or VLAN for purposes such as applying traffic filtering and QoS.
Applying the markings described in \[[RFC8837](#RFC8837){.xref}\] may be
appropriate replacements for such
techniques.[¶](#section-1-10){.pilcrow}

While this document formally relies on \[[RFC8445](#RFC8445){.xref}\],
at the time of its publication, the majority of WebRTC implementations
support the version of Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) that
is described in \[[RFC5245](#RFC5245){.xref}\] and use a pre-standard
version of the Trickle ICE mechanism described in
\[[RFC8838](#RFC8838){.xref}\]. The \"ice2\" attribute defined in
\[[RFC8445](#RFC8445){.xref}\] can be used to detect the version in use
by a remote endpoint and to provide a smooth transition from the older
specification to the newer one.[¶](#section-1-11){.pilcrow}

This memo uses the term \"WebRTC\" (note the case used) to refer to the
overall effort consisting of both IETF and W3C
efforts.[¶](#section-1-12){.pilcrow}

### [2.1.](#section-2.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Goals of This Document](#name-goals-of-this-document){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-goals-of-this-document}

The goal of the WebRTC protocol specification is to specify a set of
protocols that, if all are implemented, will allow an implementation to
communicate with another implementation using audio, video, and data
sent along the most direct possible path between the
participants.[¶](#section-2.1-1){.pilcrow}

This document is intended to serve as the roadmap to the WebRTC
specifications. It defines terms used by other parts of the WebRTC
protocol specifications, lists references to other specifications that
don\'t need further elaboration in the WebRTC context, and gives
pointers to other documents that form part of the WebRTC
suite.[¶](#section-2.1-2){.pilcrow}

By reading this document and the documents it refers to, it should be
possible to have all information needed to implement a WebRTC-compatible
implementation.[¶](#section-2.1-3){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-2.2 .section}
### [2.2.](#section-2.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Relationship between API and Protocol](#name-relationship-between-api-an){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-relationship-between-api-an}

The total WebRTC effort consists of two major parts, each consisting of
multiple documents:[¶](#section-2.2-1){.pilcrow}

-   [A protocol specification, done in the
    IETF[¶](#section-2.2-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.2-2.1}
-   [A JavaScript API specification, defined in a series of W3C
    documents \[[W3C.WD-webrtc](#W3C.WD-webrtc){.xref}\]
    \[[W3C.WD-mediacapture-streams](#W3C.WD-mediacapture-streams){.xref}\][¶](#section-2.2-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.2-2.2}

Together, these two specifications aim to provide an environment where
JavaScript embedded in any page, when suitably authorized by its user,
is able to set up communication using audio, video, and auxiliary data,
as long as the browser supports these specifications. The browser
environment does not constrain the types of application in which this
functionality can be used.[¶](#section-2.2-3){.pilcrow}

The protocol specification does not assume that all implementations
implement this API; it is not intended to be necessary for
interoperation to know whether the entity one is communicating with is a
browser or another device implementing the protocol
specification.[¶](#section-2.2-4){.pilcrow}

The goal of cooperation between the protocol specification and the API
specification is that for all options and features of the protocol
specification, it should be clear which API calls to make to exercise
that option or feature; similarly, for any sequence of API calls, it
should be clear which protocol options and features will be invoked.
Both are subject to constraints of the implementation, of
course.[¶](#section-2.2-5){.pilcrow}

The following terms are used across the documents specifying the WebRTC
suite, with the specific meanings given here. Not all terms are used in
this document. Other terms are used per their commonly used
meanings.[¶](#section-2.2-6){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

Agent:
:   Undefined term. See \"SDP Agent\" and \"ICE
    Agent\".[¶](#section-2.2-7.2){.pilcrow}
:   

Application Programming Interface (API):
:   A specification of a set of calls and events, usually tied to a
    programming language or an abstract formal specification such as
    WebIDL, with its defined semantics.[¶](#section-2.2-7.4){.pilcrow}
:   

Browser:
:   Used synonymously with \"interactive user agent\" as defined in
    \[[HTML5](#HTML5){.xref}\]. See also the \"WebRTC Browser\" (aka
    \"WebRTC User Agent\") definition
    below.[¶](#section-2.2-7.6){.pilcrow}
:   

Data Channel:
:   An abstraction that allows data to be sent between WebRTC endpoints
    in the form of messages. Two endpoints can have multiple data
    channels between them.[¶](#section-2.2-7.8){.pilcrow}
:   

ICE Agent:
:   An implementation of the Interactive Connectivity Establishment
    (ICE) protocol \[[RFC8445](#RFC8445){.xref}\]. An ICE Agent may also
    be an SDP Agent, but there exist ICE Agents that do not use SDP (for
    instance, those that use Jingle
    \[[XEP-0166](#XEP-0166){.xref}\]).[¶](#section-2.2-7.10){.pilcrow}
:   

Interactive:
:   Communication between multiple parties, where the expectation is
    that an action from one party can cause a reaction by another party,
    and the reaction can be observed by the first party, where the total
    time required for the action/reaction/observation is on the order of
    no more than hundreds of
    milliseconds.[¶](#section-2.2-7.12){.pilcrow}
:   

Media:
:   Audio and video content. Not to be confused with \"transmission
    media\" such as wires.[¶](#section-2.2-7.14){.pilcrow}
:   

Media Path:
:   The path that media data follows from one WebRTC endpoint to
    another.[¶](#section-2.2-7.16){.pilcrow}
:   

Protocol:
:   A specification of a set of data units, their representation, and
    rules for their transmission, with their defined semantics. A
    protocol is usually thought of as going between
    systems.[¶](#section-2.2-7.18){.pilcrow}
:   

Real-Time Media:
:   Media where the generation and display of content are intended to
    occur closely together in time (on the order of no more than
    hundreds of milliseconds). Real-time media can be used to support
    interactive communication.[¶](#section-2.2-7.20){.pilcrow}
:   

SDP Agent:
:   The protocol implementation involved in the Session Description
    Protocol (SDP) offer/answer exchange, as defined in
    \[[RFC3264](#RFC3264){.xref}\], [Section
    3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3264#section-3){.relref}.[¶](#section-2.2-7.22){.pilcrow}
:   

Signaling:
:   Communication that happens in order to establish, manage, and
    control media paths and data paths.[¶](#section-2.2-7.24){.pilcrow}
:   

Signaling Path:
:   The communication channels used between entities participating in
    signaling to transfer signaling. There may be more entities in the
    signaling path than in the media
    path.[¶](#section-2.2-7.26){.pilcrow}
:   

WebRTC Browser (also called a \"WebRTC User Agent\" or \"WebRTC UA\"):
:   ​ Something that conforms to both the protocol specification and the
    JavaScript API cited above.[¶](#section-2.2-7.28){.pilcrow}
:   

WebRTC Non-Browser:
:   Something that conforms to the protocol specification but does not
    claim to implement the JavaScript API. This can also be called a
    \"WebRTC device\" or \"WebRTC native
    application\".[¶](#section-2.2-7.30){.pilcrow}
:   

WebRTC Endpoint:
:   Either a WebRTC browser or a WebRTC non-browser. It conforms to the
    protocol specification.[¶](#section-2.2-7.32){.pilcrow}
:   

WebRTC-Compatible Endpoint:
:   An endpoint that is able to successfully communicate with a WebRTC
    endpoint but may fail to meet some requirements of a WebRTC
    endpoint. This may limit where in the network such an endpoint can
    be attached or may limit the security guarantees that it offers to
    others. It is not constrained by this specification; when it is
    mentioned at all, it is to note the implications on
    WebRTC-compatible endpoints of the requirements placed on WebRTC
    endpoints.[¶](#section-2.2-7.34){.pilcrow}
:   

WebRTC Gateway:
:   A WebRTC-compatible endpoint that mediates media traffic to
    non-WebRTC entities.[¶](#section-2.2-7.36){.pilcrow}
:   

All WebRTC browsers are WebRTC endpoints, so any requirement on a WebRTC
endpoint also applies to a WebRTC browser.[¶](#section-2.2-8){.pilcrow}

A WebRTC non-browser may be capable of hosting applications in a way
that is similar to the way in which a browser can host JavaScript
applications, typically by offering APIs in other languages. For
instance, it may be implemented as a library that offers a C++ API
intended to be loaded into applications. In this case, security
considerations similar to those for JavaScript may be needed; however,
since such APIs are not defined or referenced here, this document cannot
give any specific rules for those
interfaces.[¶](#section-2.2-9){.pilcrow}

WebRTC gateways are described in a separate document
\[[WebRTC-Gateways](#I-D.ietf-rtcweb-gateways){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2.2-10){.pilcrow}

### [2.3.](#section-2.3){.section-number .selfRef} [On Interoperability and Innovation](#name-on-interoperability-and-inn){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-on-interoperability-and-inn}

The \"Mission statement for the IETF\" \[[RFC3935](#RFC3935){.xref}\]
states that \"The benefit of a standard to the Internet is in
interoperability - that multiple products implementing a standard are
able to work together in order to deliver valuable functions to the
Internet\'s users.\"[¶](#section-2.3-1){.pilcrow}

Communication on the Internet frequently occurs in two
phases:[¶](#section-2.3-2){.pilcrow}

-   [Two parties communicate, through some mechanism, what functionality
    they are both able to
    support.[¶](#section-2.3-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.3-3.1}
-   [They use that shared communicative functionality to communicate or,
    failing to find anything in common, give up on
    communication.[¶](#section-2.3-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-2.3-3.2}

There are often many choices that can be made for communicative
functionality; the history of the Internet is rife with the proposal,
standardization, implementation, and success or failure of many types of
options, in all sorts of protocols.[¶](#section-2.3-4){.pilcrow}

The goal of having a mandatory-to-implement function set is to prevent
negotiation failure, not to preempt or prevent
negotiation.[¶](#section-2.3-5){.pilcrow}

The presence of a mandatory-to-implement function set serves as a strong
changer of the marketplace of deployment in that it gives a guarantee
that you can communicate successfully as long as (1) you conform to a
specification and (2) the other party is willing to accept communication
at the base level of that specification.[¶](#section-2.3-6){.pilcrow}

The alternative (that is, not having a mandatory-to-implement function)
does not mean that you cannot communicate; it merely means that in order
to be part of the communications partnership, you have to implement the
standard \"and then some\". The \"and then some\" is usually called a
profile of some sort; in the version most antithetical to the Internet
ethos, that \"and then some\" consists of having to use a specific
vendor\'s product only.[¶](#section-2.3-7){.pilcrow}

For browser-based applications, the model for real-time support does not
assume that the browser will contain all the functions needed for an
application such as a telephone or a video conference. The vision is
that the browser will have the functions needed for a web application,
working in conjunction with its backend servers, to implement these
functions.[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

This means that two vital interfaces need specification: the protocols
that browsers use to talk to each other, without any intervening
servers; and the APIs that are offered for a JavaScript application to
take advantage of the browser\'s
functionality.[¶](#section-3-2){.pilcrow}

In this drawing, the critical part to note is that the media path (\"low
path\") goes directly between the browsers, so it has to be conformant
to the specifications of the WebRTC protocol suite; the signaling path
(\"high path\") goes via servers that can modify, translate, or
manipulate the signals as needed.[¶](#section-3-8){.pilcrow}

If the two web servers are operated by different entities, the
inter-server signaling mechanism needs to be agreed upon, by either
standardization or other means of agreement. Existing protocols (e.g.,
SIP \[[RFC3261](#RFC3261){.xref}\] or the Extensible Messaging and
Presence Protocol (XMPP) \[[RFC6120](#RFC6120){.xref}\]) could be used
between servers, while either a standards-based or proprietary protocol
could be used between the browser and the web
server.[¶](#section-3-9){.pilcrow}

For example, if both operators\' servers implement SIP, SIP could be
used for communication between servers, along with either a standardized
signaling mechanism (e.g., SIP over WebSockets) or a proprietary
signaling mechanism used between the application running in the browser
and the web server. Similarly, if both operators\' servers implement
XMPP, XMPP could be used for communication between XMPP servers, with
either a standardized signaling mechanism (e.g., XMPP over WebSockets or
Bidirectional-streams Over Synchronous HTTP (BOSH)
\[[XEP-0124](#XEP-0124){.xref}\]) or a proprietary signaling mechanism
used between the application running in the browser and the web
server.[¶](#section-3-10){.pilcrow}

The choice of protocols for client-server and inter-server signaling,
and the definition of the translation between them, are outside the
scope of the WebRTC protocol suite described in this
document.[¶](#section-3-11){.pilcrow}

The functionality groups that are needed in the browser can be
specified, more or less from the bottom up,
as:[¶](#section-3-12){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

Data transport:
:   For example, TCP and UDP, and the means to securely set up
    connections between entities, as well as the functions for deciding
    when to send data: congestion management, bandwidth estimation, and
    so on.[¶](#section-3-13.2){.pilcrow}
:   

Data framing:
:   RTP, the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP), DTLS, and
    other data formats that serve as containers, and their functions for
    data confidentiality and integrity.[¶](#section-3-13.4){.pilcrow}
:   

Data formats:
:   Codec specifications, format specifications, and functionality
    specifications for the data passed between systems. Audio and video
    codecs, as well as formats for data and document sharing, belong in
    this category. In order to make use of data formats, a way to
    describe them (e.g., a session description) is
    needed.[¶](#section-3-13.6){.pilcrow}
:   

Connection management:
:   For example, setting up connections, agreeing on data formats,
    changing data formats during the duration of a call. SDP, SIP, and
    Jingle/XMPP belong in this category.[¶](#section-3-13.8){.pilcrow}
:   

Presentation and control:
:   What needs to happen in order to ensure that interactions behave in
    an unsurprising manner. This can include floor control, screen
    layout, voice-activated image switching, and other such functions,
    where part of the system requires cooperation between parties.
    Centralized Conferencing (XCON) \[[RFC6501](#RFC6501){.xref}\] and
    Cisco⁠/Tandberg\'s Telepresence Interoperability Protocol (TIP) were
    some attempts at specifying this kind of functionality; many
    applications have been built without standardized interfaces to
    these functions.[¶](#section-3-13.10){.pilcrow}
:   

Local system support functions:
:   Functions that need not be specified uniformly, because each
    participant may implement these functions as they choose, without
    affecting the bits on the wire in a way that others have to be
    cognizant of. Examples in this category include echo cancellation
    (some forms of it), local authentication and authorization
    mechanisms, OS access control, and the ability to do local recording
    of conversations.[¶](#section-3-13.12){.pilcrow}
:   

Within each functionality group, it is important to preserve both
freedom to innovate and the ability for global communication. Freedom to
innovate is helped by doing the specification in terms of interfaces,
not implementation; any implementation able to communicate according to
the interfaces is a valid implementation. The ability to communicate
globally is helped by both (1) having core specifications be
unencumbered by IPR issues and (2) having the formats and protocols be
fully enough specified to allow for independent
implementation.[¶](#section-3-14){.pilcrow}

One can think of the first three groups as forming a \"media transport
infrastructure\" and of the last three groups as forming a \"media
service\". In many contexts, it makes sense to use a common
specification for the media transport infrastructure, which can be
embedded in browsers and accessed using standard interfaces, and \"let a
thousand flowers bloom\" in the \"media service\" layer; to achieve
interoperable services, however, at least the first five of the six
groups need to be specified.[¶](#section-3-15){.pilcrow}

to use the data formats that are best suited for that particular
instance, where a format is supported by both sides of the connection.
However, a minimum standard is greatly helpful in order to ensure that
communication can be achieved. This document specifies a minimum
baseline that will be supported by all implementations of this

The methods, mechanisms, and requirements for setting up, negotiating,

is desirable to have both interoperability and freedom to
innovate.[¶](#section-7-1){.pilcrow}

The following principles apply:[¶](#section-7-2){.pilcrow}

1.  [The WebRTC media negotiations will be capable of representing the
    same SDP offer/answer semantics \[[RFC3264](#RFC3264){.xref}\] that
    are used in SIP, in such a way that it is possible to build a
    signaling gateway between SIP and the WebRTC media
    negotiation.[¶](#section-7-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-7-3.1}
2.  [It will be possible to gateway between legacy SIP devices that
    support ICE and appropriate RTP/SDP mechanisms, codecs, and security
    mechanisms without using a media gateway. A signaling gateway to
    convert between the signaling on the web side and the SIP signaling
    may be needed.[¶](#section-7-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-7-3.2}
3.  [When an SDP for a new codec is specified, no other standardization
    should be required for it to be possible to use that codec in the
    web browsers. Adding new codecs that might have new SDP parameters
    should not change the APIs between the browser and the JavaScript
    application. As soon as the browsers support the new codecs, old
    applications written before the codecs were specified should
    automatically be able to use the new codecs where appropriate, with
    no changes to the JavaScript
    applications.[¶](#section-7-3.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-7-3.3}

The particular choices made for WebRTC, and their implications for the
API offered by a browser implementing WebRTC, are described in
\[[RFC8829](#RFC8829){.xref}\].[¶](#section-7-4){.pilcrow}

WebRTC browsers [MUST]{.bcp14} implement
\[[RFC8829](#RFC8829){.xref}\].[¶](#section-7-5){.pilcrow}

WebRTC endpoints [MUST]{.bcp14} implement those functions described in
\[[RFC8829](#RFC8829){.xref}\] that relate to the network layer (e.g.,
BUNDLE \[[RFC8843](#RFC8843){.xref}\], \"rtcp-mux\"
\[[RFC5761](#RFC5761){.xref}\], and Trickle ICE
\[[RFC8838](#RFC8838){.xref}\]), but these endpoints do not need to

The most important part of control is the users\' control over the
browser\'s interaction with input/output devices and communications
channels. It is important that the users have some way of figuring out
where their audio, video, or texting is being sent; for what purported
reason; and what guarantees are made by the parties that form part of
this control channel. This is largely a local function between the
browser, the underlying operating system, and the user interface; this
is specified in the peer connection API

\[[W3C.WD-mediacapture-streams](#W3C.WD-mediacapture-streams){.xref}\].[¶](#section-8-1){.pilcrow}

## [9.](#section-9){.section-number .selfRef} [Local System Support Functions](#name-local-system-support-functi){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-local-system-support-functi}

These functions are characterized by the fact that the quality of an
implementation strongly influences the user experience, but the exact
algorithm does not need coordination. In some cases (for instance, echo
cancellation, as described below), the overall system definition may
need to specify that the overall system needs to have some
characteristics for which these facilities are useful, without requiring
them to be implemented a certain way.[¶](#section-9-1){.pilcrow}

Local functions include echo cancellation; volume control; camera
management, including focus, zoom, and pan/tilt controls (if available);
and more.[¶](#section-9-2){.pilcrow}

One would want to see certain parts of the system conform to certain
properties; for instance:[¶](#section-9-3){.pilcrow}

-   [Echo cancellation should be good enough to achieve the suppression
    of acoustical feedback loops below a perceptually noticeable
    level.[¶](#section-9-4.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-9-4.1}
-   [Privacy concerns [MUST]{.bcp14} be satisfied; for instance, if
    remote control of a camera is offered, the APIs should be available
    to let the local participant figure out who\'s controlling the
    camera and possibly decide to revoke the permission for camera
    usage.[¶](#section-9-4.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-9-4.2}
-   [Automatic Gain Control (AGC), if present, should normalize a
    speaking voice into a reasonable dB
    range.[¶](#section-9-4.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-9-4.3}

The requirements on WebRTC systems with regard to audio processing are
found in \[[RFC7874](#RFC7874){.xref}\], and that document includes more
guidance about echo cancellation and AGC; the APIs for control of local
devices are found in

[]{.break}

Security of the components:

Security of the communication channels:

Security of the partners\' identities:
