# RFC 8653 {#rfcnum}

# On-Demand Mobility Management {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

Applications differ with respect to whether they need session continuity
and/or IP address reachability. The network providing the same type of
service to any mobile host and any application running on the host
yields inefficiencies, as described in RFC 7333. This document defines a
new concept of enabling applications to influence the network\'s
mobility services (session continuity and/or IP address reachability) on
a per-socket basis, and suggests extensions to the networking stack\'s
API to accommodate this concept.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

In the context of Mobile IP \[[RFC5563](#RFC5563){.xref}\]
\[[RFC6275](#RFC6275){.xref}\] \[[RFC5213](#RFC5213){.xref}\]
\[[RFC5944](#RFC5944){.xref}\], the following two attributes are defined
for IP service provided to mobile hosts:[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

Session Continuity
:   The ability to maintain an ongoing transport interaction by keeping
    the same local endpoint IP address throughout the lifetime of the IP
    socket despite the mobile host changing its point of attachment
    within the IP network topology. The IP address of the host may
    change after closing the IP socket and before opening a new one, but
    that does not jeopardize the ability of applications using these IP
    sockets to work flawlessly. Session continuity is essential for
    mobile hosts to maintain ongoing flows without any
    interruption.[¶](#section-1-2.2){.pilcrow}

IP Address Reachability
:   The ability to maintain the same IP address for an extended period
    of time. The IP address stays the same across independent sessions,
    even in the absence of any session. The IP address may be published
    in a long-term registry (e.g., DNS) and is made available for
    serving incoming (e.g., TCP) connections. IP address reachability is
    essential for mobile hosts to use specific/published IP
    addresses.[¶](#section-1-2.4){.pilcrow}

Mobile IP is designed to provide both session continuity and IP address
reachability to mobile hosts. Architectures using these protocols (e.g.,
3GPP, 3GPP2, WiMAX) ensure that any mobile host attached to a compliant
network can enjoy these benefits. Any application running on these
mobile hosts is subjected to the same treatment with respect to session
continuity and IP address reachability.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

Achieving session continuity and IP address reachability with Mobile IP
incurs some cost. Mobile IP forces the mobile host\'s IP traffic to
traverse a centrally located router (Home Agent, HA), which incurs
additional transmission latency and use of additional network resources,
adds to the network\'s operating and capital expenditures, and decreases
the reliability of the network due to the introduction of a single point
of failure \[[RFC7333](#RFC7333){.xref}\]. Therefore, session continuity
and IP address reachability [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be provided only when
necessary.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

In reality, not every application may need these benefits. IP address
reachability is required for applications running as servers (e.g., a
web server running on the mobile host), but a typical client application
(e.g., web browser) does not necessarily require IP address
reachability. Similarly, session continuity is not required for all
types of applications either. Applications performing brief
communication (e.g., text messaging) can survive without having session
continuity support.[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}

Furthermore, when an application needs session continuity, it may be
able to satisfy that need by using a solution above the IP layer, such
as Multipath TCP \[[RFC6824](#RFC6824){.xref}\], SIP mobility
\[[RFC3261](#RFC3261){.xref}\], or an application-layer mobility
solution. These higher-layer solutions are not subject to the same
issues that arise with the use of Mobile IP since they can use the most
direct data path between the endpoints. But, if Mobile IP is being
applied to the mobile host, the higher-layer protocols are rendered
useless because their operation is inhibited by Mobile IP. Since Mobile
IP ensures that the IP address of the mobile host remains fixed (despite
the location and movement of the mobile host), the higher-layer
protocols never detect the IP-layer change and never engage in mobility
management.[¶](#section-1-6){.pilcrow}

This document proposes a solution for applications running on mobile
hosts to indicate when establishing the network connection (\'on
demand\') whether they need session continuity or IP address
reachability. The network protocol stack on the mobile host, in
conjunction with the network infrastructure, provides the required type
of service. It is for the benefit of both the users and the network
operators not to engage an extra level of service unless it is
absolutely necessary. It is expected that applications and networks
compliant with this specification will utilize this solution to use
network resources more efficiently.[¶](#section-1-7){.pilcrow}

Enabling applications to indicate their mobility service requirements
(e.g., session continuity and/or IP address reachability) comprises the
following steps:[¶](#section-3.1-1){.pilcrow}

1.  [The application indicates to the network stack (local to the mobile
    host) the desired mobility
    service.[¶](#section-3.1-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.1-2.1}
2.  [The network stack assigns a source IP address based on an IP prefix
    with the desired services that was previously provided by the
    network. If such an IP prefix is not available, the network stack
    performs the additional steps
    below.[¶](#section-3.1-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.1-2.2}
3.  [The network stack sends a request to the network for a new source
    IP prefix that is associated with the desired mobility
    service.[¶](#section-3.1-2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.1-2.3}
4.  [The network responds with the suitable allocated source IP prefix
    (or responds with a failure
    indication).[¶](#section-3.1-2.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.1-2.4}
5.  [If the suitable source IP prefix was allocated, the network stack
    constructs a source IP address and provides it to the
    application.[¶](#section-3.1-2.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.1-2.5}

This document specifies the new address types associated with mobility
services and details the interaction between the applications and the
network stack steps. It uses the socket interface as an example for an
API between applications and the network stack. Other steps are outside
the scope of this document.[¶](#section-3.1-3){.pilcrow}

### [3.2.](#section-3.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Types of IP Addresses](#name-types-of-ip-addresses){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-types-of-ip-addresses}

Four types of IP addresses are defined with respect to mobility
management:[¶](#section-3.2-1){.pilcrow}

Fixed IP address

:   A Fixed IP address is an address guaranteed to be valid for a very
    long time, regardless of whether it is being used in any packet
    to/from the mobile host, or whether or not the mobile host is
    connected to the network, or whether it moves from one point of
    attachment to another (with a different IP prefix) while it is
    connected.[¶](#section-3.2-2.2.1){.pilcrow}

    Fixed IP addresses are required by applications that need both
    session continuity and IP address
    reachability.[¶](#section-3.2-2.2.2){.pilcrow}

Session-Lasting IP address

:   A Session-Lasting IP address is an address guaranteed to be valid
    for the lifetime of the socket(s) for which it was requested. It is
    guaranteed to be valid even after the mobile host has moved from one
    point of attachment to another (with a different IP
    prefix).[¶](#section-3.2-2.4.1){.pilcrow}

    Session-Lasting IP addresses are required by applications that need
    session continuity but do not need IP address
    reachability.[¶](#section-3.2-2.4.2){.pilcrow}

Nonpersistent IP address

:   This type of IP address is not guaranteed to exist after a mobile
    host moves from one point of attachment to another; therefore, no
    session continuity nor IP address reachability are provided. The IP
    address is created from an IP prefix that is obtained from the
    serving IP gateway and is not maintained across gateway changes. In
    other words, the IP prefix may be released and replaced by a new one
    when the IP gateway changes due to the movement of the mobile host
    forcing the creation of a new source IP address with the updated
    allocated IP prefix.[¶](#section-3.2-2.6.1){.pilcrow}

Graceful-Replacement IP address

:   In some cases, the network cannot guarantee the validity of the
    provided IP prefix throughout the duration of the opened socket, but
    can provide a limited graceful period of time in which both the
    original IP prefix and a new one are valid. This enables the
    application some flexibility in the transition from the existing
    source IP address to the new one.[¶](#section-3.2-2.8.1){.pilcrow}

    This gracefulness is still better than the nonpersistence type of
    address for applications that can handle a change in their source IP
    address but require that extra
    flexibility.[¶](#section-3.2-2.8.2){.pilcrow}

Applications running as servers at a published IP address require a
Fixed IP address. Long-standing applications (e.g., an SSH session) may
also require this type of address. Enterprise applications that connect
to an enterprise network via virtual LAN require a Fixed IP
address.[¶](#section-3.2-3){.pilcrow}

Applications with short-lived transient sessions (e.g., web browsers)
can use Session-Lasting IP addresses.[¶](#section-3.2-4){.pilcrow}

Applications with very short sessions, such as DNS clients and instant
messengers, can use Nonpersistent IP addresses. Even though they could
very well use Fixed or Session-Lasting IP addresses, the transmission
latency would be minimized when a Nonpersistent IP address is
used.[¶](#section-3.2-5){.pilcrow}

Applications that can tolerate a short interruption in connectivity can
use the Graceful-Replacement IP addresses, for example, a streaming
client that has buffering capabilities.[¶](#section-3.2-6){.pilcrow}

### [3.3.](#section-3.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Granularity of Selection](#name-granularity-of-selection){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-granularity-of-selection}

IP address type selection is made on a per-socket granularity. Different
parts of the same application may have different needs. For example, the
control plane of an application may require a Fixed IP address in order
to stay reachable, whereas the data plane of the same application may be
satisfied with a Session-Lasting IP
address.[¶](#section-3.3-1){.pilcrow}

### [3.4.](#section-3.4){.section-number .selfRef} [On-Demand Nature](#name-on-demand-nature){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-on-demand-nature}

At any point in time, a mobile host may have a combination of IP
addresses configured. Zero or more Fixed, zero or more Session-Lasting,
zero or more Nonpersistent, and zero or more Graceful-Replacement IP
addresses may be configured by the IP stack of the host. The combination
may be a result of the host policy, application demand, or a mix of the
two.[¶](#section-3.4-1){.pilcrow}

When an application requires a specific type of IP address, and such an
address is not already configured on the host, the IP stack
[SHALL]{.bcp14} attempt to configure one. For example, a host may not
always have a Session-Lasting IP address available. When an application
requests one, the IP stack [SHALL]{.bcp14} make an attempt to configure
one by issuing a request to the network. If the operation fails, the IP
stack [SHALL]{.bcp14} fail the associated socket request and return an
error. If successful, a Session-Lasting IP address is configured on the
mobile host. If another socket requests a Session-Lasting IP address at
a later time, the same IP address may be served to that socket as well.
When the last socket using the same configured IP address is closed, the
IP address may be released, or it may be kept for applications requiring
a Session-Lasting IP address that may be launched in the
future.[¶](#section-3.4-2){.pilcrow}

In some cases, it might be preferable for the mobile host to request a
new Session-Lasting IP address for a new opening of an IP socket (even
though one was already assigned to the mobile host by the network and
might be in use in a different, already active IP socket). It is outside
the scope of this specification to define criteria for choosing to use
available addresses or choosing to request new ones. It supports both
alternatives (and any combination).[¶](#section-3.4-3){.pilcrow}

It is outside the scope of this specification to define how the host
requests a specific type of prefix and how the network indicates the
type of prefix in its advertisement or in its reply to a
request.[¶](#section-3.4-4){.pilcrow}

The following are matters of policy, which may be dictated by the host
itself, the network operator, or the system architecture
standard:[¶](#section-3.4-5){.pilcrow}

    time[¶](#section-3.4-6.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3.4-6.1}

    not explicitly indicate whether it supports the required API or is a

Legacy applications that do not support the On-Demand functionality will

On-Demand Mobility feature.[¶](#section-4.1-1){.pilcrow}

Applications using the new On-Demand functionality should be aware that
they may be executed in legacy environments that do not support it. Such
environments may include a legacy IP stack on the mobile host, legacy
network infrastructure, or both. In either case, the API will return an
error code, and the invoking application may just give up and use legacy

New IP stacks (that implement On-Demand functionality) [MUST]{.bcp14}
continue to support all legacy operations. If an application does not
use On-Demand functionality, the IP stack [MUST]{.bcp14} respond in a
legacy manner.[¶](#section-4.2-1){.pilcrow}

If the network infrastructure supports On-Demand functionality, the IP
stack [SHOULD]{.bcp14} follow the application request: If the
application requests a specific address type, the stack [SHOULD]{.bcp14}
forward this request to the network. If the application does not request
an address type, the IP stack [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} request an address
type. Instead, the network will choose the type of allocated IP prefix.
How the network selects the type of allocated IP prefix is outside the
scope of this document. If an IP prefix was already allocated to the
host, the IP stack uses it and may not request a new one from the
network.[¶](#section-4.2-2){.pilcrow}

### [4.4.](#section-4.4){.section-number .selfRef} [Merging this work with RFC 5014](#name-merging-this-work-with-rfc-){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-merging-this-work-with-rfc-}

\[[RFC5014](#RFC5014){.xref}\] defines new flags that may be used with
setsockopt() to influence source IP address selection for a socket. The
list of flags include the following: source home address, care-of
address, temporary address, public address CGA (Cryptographically
Created Address), and non-CGA. When applications require session
continuity service, they [SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} set the flags specified in
\[[RFC5014](#RFC5014){.xref}\].[¶](#section-4.4-1){.pilcrow}

However, if an application erroneously performs a combination of (1)
using setsockopt() to set a specific option (using one of the flags
specified in \[[RFC5014](#RFC5014){.xref}\]) and (2) selecting a source
IP address type, the IP stack will fulfill the request specified by (2)
and ignore the flags set by (1).[¶](#section-4.4-2){.pilcrow}

## [5.](#section-5){.section-number .selfRef} [Security Considerations](#name-security-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-security-considerations}

The different service types (session continuity types and address
reachability) associated with the allocated IP address types may be
associated with different costs: the cost to the operator for enabling a
type of service, and the cost to applications using a selected service.
A malicious application may use these to indirectly generate extra
billing of a mobile subscriber, and/or impose costly services on the
mobile operator. When expensive services are limited, malicious
applications may exhaust them, preventing other applications on the same
mobile host from being able to use them.[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

Mobile hosts that enable such service options should provide
capabilities for ensuring that only authorized applications can use the
expensive (or limited) service types.[¶](#section-5-2){.pilcrow}

The ability to select service types requires the exchange of the
association of source IP prefixes and their corresponding service types,
between the mobile host and mobile network. Exposing these associations
may provide information to passive attackers even if the traffic that is
used with these addresses is encrypted.[¶](#section-5-3){.pilcrow}

To avoid profiling an application according to the type of IP address,
it is expected that prefixes provided by the mobile operator are
associated with various types of addresses over time. As a result, the
type of address cannot be associated with the prefix, making application
profiling based on the type of address more
difficult.[¶](#section-5-4){.pilcrow}

The application or the OS should ensure that IP addresses regularly
change to limit IP tracking by a passive observer. The application
should regularly set the On-Demand flag. The application should be able
to ensure that Session-Lasting IP addresses are regularly changed by
setting a lifetime, for example, handled by the application. In
addition, the application should consider the use of
Graceful-Replacement IP addresses.[¶](#section-5-5){.pilcrow}

Similarly, the OS may also associate IP addresses with a lifetime. Upon
receiving a request for a given type of IP address, after some time, the
OS should request a new address to the network even if it already has
one IP address available with the requested type. This includes any type
of IP address. IP addresses of type Graceful-Replacement or
nonpersistent should be regularly renewed by the
OS.[¶](#section-5-6){.pilcrow}

The lifetime of an IP address may be expressed in number of seconds or
in number of bytes sent through this IP
address.[¶](#section-5-7){.pilcrow}

## [Appendix A.](#section-appendix.a){.section-number .selfRef} [Conveying the Desired Address Type](#name-conveying-the-desired-addre){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-conveying-the-desired-addre}

The following are some suggestions of possible extensions to the socket
API for enabling applications to convey their session continuity and
address reachability requirements.[¶](#section-appendix.a-1){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC5014](#RFC5014){.xref}\] introduced the ability of applications to
influence the source address selection with the IPV6_ADDR_PREFERENCE
option at the IPPROTO_IPV6 level. This option is used with setsockopt()
and getsockopt() calls to set/get address selection
preferences.[¶](#section-appendix.a-2){.pilcrow}

One alternative is to extend the definition of the IPV6_ADDR_REFERENCE
option with flags that express the invoker\'s desire. An \"OnDemand\"
field could contain one of the following values: FIXED_IP_ADDRESS,
SESSION_LASTING_IP_ADDRESS, NON_PERSISTENT_IP_ADDRESS, or
GRACEFUL_REPLACEMENT_IP_ADDRESS.[¶](#section-appendix.a-3){.pilcrow}

Another alternative is to define a new socket function used by the
invoker to convey its desire. This enables the implementation of two
behaviors of socket functions: the existing setsockopt() is a function
that returns after executing, and the new setsc() (Set Service
Continuity) is a function that may initiate a request for the desired
service, and wait until the network responds with the allocated
resources, before returning to the
invoker.[¶](#section-appendix.a-4){.pilcrow}

After obtaining an IP address with the desired behavior, the application
can call the bind() socket function to associate that received IP
address with the socket.[¶](#section-appendix.a-5){.pilcrow}
