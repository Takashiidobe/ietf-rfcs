# RFC 8788 {#rfcnum}

# Eligibility for the 2020-2021 Nominating Committee {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

The 2020-2021 Nominating Committee (NomCom) is to be formed between the
IETF 107 and IETF 108 meetings, and the issue of eligibility of who can
serve on that NomCom needs clarification. This document provides a
one-time interpretation of the eligibility rules that is required for
the exceptional situation of the cancellation of the in-person IETF 107
meeting. This document only affects the seating of the 2020-2021 NomCom
and any rules or processes that relate to NomCom eligibility before IETF
108; it does not set a precedent to be applied in the
future.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

The COVID-19 outbreak, which at the time of this writing was declared a
global pandemic \[[PANDEMIC](#PANDEMIC){.xref}\], has resulted in the
cancellation of the in-person IETF 107 meeting
\[[CANCEL107](#CANCEL107){.xref}\]. This resulted in its conversion to a
virtual meeting with a limited agenda and remote participation only
\[[VIRTUAL107](#VIRTUAL107){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

The 2020-2021 Nominating Committee (NomCom) is to be formed between the
IETF 107 and IETF 108 meetings, and the issue of eligibility of who can
serve on that NomCom needs clarification: a one-time interpretation of
the eligibility rules is required for this particular exceptional
situation. That interpretation will apply to the seating of that NomCom
and to any rules or processes that relate to NomCom eligibility before
the scheduled time for IETF 108.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

[Section
4.14](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8713#section-4.14){.relref} of
\[[RFC8713](#RFC8713){.xref}\] (BCP 10) includes these requirements for
eligibility:[¶](#section-2-1){.pilcrow}

> Members of the IETF community must have attended at least three of the
> last five IETF meetings in order to
> volunteer.[¶](#section-2-2.1){.pilcrow}
>
> The five meetings are the five most recent meetings that ended prior
> to the date on which the solicitation for NomCom volunteers was
> submitted for distribution to the IETF
> community.[¶](#section-2-2.2){.pilcrow}

On 13 March 2020, a message was posted to the IETF discussion list
\[[SOLICITINPUT](#SOLICITINPUT){.xref}\] suggesting two possible
interpretations and asking for community input that might include
suggesting other interpretations. Discussion over the subsequent two
weeks centered around three:[¶](#section-2-3){.pilcrow}

1.  [Do not count IETF 107 at all, for the purpose of NomCom
    eligibility, as BCP 10 clearly refers to in-person meetings only.
    NomCom eligibility would, therefore, be based on attendance at IETFs
    102 through 106.[¶](#section-2-4.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-2-4.1}
2.  [Do not have anyone lose eligibility because of IETF 107, but do
    count someone as having attended 107, for the purpose of NomCom
    eligibility, if that person attended the IETF 107 virtual meeting
    (signed the electronic blue sheet). People could thus gain
    eligibility from IETF 107, but could not lose eligibility from it,
    and eligibility would be based on attendance at IETFs 102 through
    107.[¶](#section-2-4.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-2-4.2}
3.  [Count virtual attendance at IETF 107 and consider IETF 107 as one
    of the last five meetings, so that NomCom eligibility would be based
    on attendance at IETFs 103 through
    107.[¶](#section-2-4.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-2-4.3}

In judging rough consensus, the IESG has considered the arguments and
levels of support for and against each option. The arguments largely
involved issues of fairness to newer participants, acceptance of more
participants in the volunteer pool, and greatest adherence to the spirit
of the rules defined in BCP 10, which is the community-consensus basis
we are working from.[¶](#section-2-5){.pilcrow}

On 25 March 2020, a message was posted to the IETF discussion list
\[[COMMENTDEADLINE](#COMMENTDEADLINE){.xref}\] asking for final comments
by 30 April 2020. This documents the outcome of that discussion with the
choice of interpretation 1, above.[¶](#section-2-6){.pilcrow}

The following text modifies, for the 2020-2021 NomCom cycle only, the
first two paragraphs (quoted above) of [Section
4.14](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8713#section-4.14){.relref} of
\[[RFC8713](#RFC8713){.xref}\] (BCP 10) as
follows:[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

-   [Members of the IETF community must have attended at least three of
    the last five in-person IETF meetings in order to
    volunteer.[¶](#section-3-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-2.1}
-   [The five meetings are the five most recent in-person meetings that
    ended prior to the date on which the solicitation for NomCom
    volunteers was submitted for distribution to the IETF community.
    Because no IETF 107 in-person meeting was held, for the 2020-2021
    Nominating Committee, those five meetings are IETFs 102, 103, 104,
    105, and 106.[¶](#section-3-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-2.2}

This update is an emergency interpretation of the intent of BCP 10 for
this current exceptional situation only. It applies only to the
2020-2021 NomCom, which is expected to be seated prior to IETF 108, and
to any rules or processes that relate to NomCom eligibility before IETF
108. It will explicitly not apply to any future NomCom and does not set
precedent: an update to BCP 10 will be necessary to address future
eligibility, as there will be time for proper community work on such an
update (see \[[ELIGIBILITYDISCUSS](#ELIGIBILITYDISCUSS){.xref}\]). That
update could change any part of the BCP 10 process, including anything
specified in this document.[¶](#section-3-3){.pilcrow}
