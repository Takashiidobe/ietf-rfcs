# RFC 8792 {#rfcnum}

# Handling Long Lines in Content of Internet-Drafts and RFCs {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

This document defines two strategies for handling long lines in
width-bounded text content. One strategy, called the \"single
backslash\" strategy, is based on the historical use of a single
backslash (\'\\\') character to indicate where line-folding has
occurred, with the continuation occurring with the first character that
is not a space character (\' \') on the next line. The second strategy,
called the \"double backslash\" strategy, extends the first strategy by
adding a second backslash character to identify where the continuation
begins and is thereby able to handle cases not supported by the first
strategy. Both strategies use a self-describing header enabling
automated reconstitution of the original
content.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC7994](#RFC7994){.xref}\] sets out the requirements for plain-text
RFCs and states that each line of an RFC (and hence of an
Internet-Draft) must be limited to 72 characters followed by the
character sequence that denotes an end-of-line
(EOL).[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

Internet-Drafts and RFCs often include example text or code fragments.
Many times, the example text or code exceeds the 72-character
line-length limit. The \'xml2rfc\' utility
\[[xml2rfc](#xml2rfc){.xref}\], at the time of this document\'s
publication, does not attempt to wrap the content of such inclusions,
simply issuing a warning whenever lines exceed 69 characters.
Historically, there has been no convention recommended by the RFC Editor
in place for how to handle long lines in such inclusions, other than
advising authors to clearly indicate what manipulation has
occurred.[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

This document defines two strategies for handling long lines in
width-bounded text content. One strategy, called the \"single
backslash\" strategy, is based on the historical use of a single
backslash (\'\\\') character to indicate where line-folding has
occurred, with the continuation occurring with the first character that
is not a space character (\' \') on the next line. The second strategy,
called the \"double backslash\" strategy, extends the first strategy by
adding a second backslash character to identify where the continuation
begins and is thereby able to handle cases not supported by the first
strategy. Both strategies use a self-describing header enabling
automated reconstitution of the original
content.[¶](#section-1-3){.pilcrow}

The strategies defined in this document work on any text content but are
primarily intended for a structured sequence of lines, such as would be
referenced by the \<sourcecode> element defined in [Section
2.48](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7991#section-2.48){.relref} of
\[[RFC7991](#RFC7991){.xref}\], rather than for two-dimensional imagery,
such as would be referenced by the \<artwork> element defined in
[Section
2.5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7991#section-2.5){.relref} of
\[[RFC7991](#RFC7991){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

Note that text files are represented as lines having their first
character in column 1, and a line length of N where the last character
is in the Nth column and is immediately followed by an end-of-line
character sequence.[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}

The formats and algorithms defined in this document may be used in any
context, whether for IETF documents or in other situations where
structured folding is desired.[¶](#section-2-1){.pilcrow}

Within the IETF, this work primarily targets the xml2rfc v3
\<sourcecode> element ([Section
2.48](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7991#section-2.48){.relref} of
\[[RFC7991](#RFC7991){.xref}\]) and the xml2rfc v2 \<artwork> element
([Section

\[[RFC7749](#RFC7749){.xref}\]), which, for lack of a better option, is
used in xml2rfc v2 for both source code and artwork. This work may also
be used for the xml2rfc v3 \<artwork> element ([Section

Automated folding of long lines is needed in order to support documents
that are dynamically compiled to include content with potentially
unconstrained line lengths. For instance, the build process may wish to
include content from other local files or content that is dynamically
generated by some external process. Both of these cases are discussed
next.[¶](#section-4.1-1){.pilcrow}

Many documents need to include the content from local files (e.g., XML,
JSON, ABNF, ASN.1). Prior to including a file\'s content, the build
process [SHOULD]{.bcp14} first validate these source files using
format-specific validators. In order for such tooling to be able to
process the files, the files must be in their original/natural state,
which may entail them having some long lines. Thus, these source files
need to be folded before inclusion into the XML document, in order to
satisfy \'xml2rfc\' line-length limits.[¶](#section-4.1-2){.pilcrow}

Similarly, documents sometimes contain dynamically generated output,
typically from an external process operating on the same source files
discussed in the previous paragraph. For instance, such processes may
translate the input format to another format, or they may render a
report on, or a view of, the input file. In some cases, the dynamically
generated output may contain lines exceeding the \'xml2rfc\' line-length
limits.[¶](#section-4.1-3){.pilcrow}

In both cases, folding is required and [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be automated to
reduce effort and errors resulting from manual
processing.[¶](#section-4.1-4){.pilcrow}

Automated reconstitution of the exact original text content is needed to
support validation of text-based content extracted from

While the solution presented in this document works on any kind of
text-based content, it is most useful on content that represents source
code (XML, JSON, etc.) or, more generally, on content that has not been
laid out in two dimensions (e.g.,
diagrams).[¶](#section-5.1-1){.pilcrow}

Fundamentally, the issue is whether the text content remains readable
once folded. Text content that is unpredictable is especially
susceptible to looking bad when folded; falling into this category are
most Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams, YANG tree diagrams, and
ASCII art in general.[¶](#section-5.1-2){.pilcrow}

It is [NOT RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14} to use the solution presented in this

The solution presented in this document works generically for all
text-based content, as it only views content as plain text. However,
various formats sometimes have built-in mechanisms that are better
suited to prevent long lines.[¶](#section-5.2-1){.pilcrow}

For instance, both the \'pyang\' and \'yanglint\' utilities
\[[pyang](#pyang){.xref}\] \[[yanglint](#yanglint){.xref}\] have the
command-line option \"tree-line-length\", which can be used to indicate
a desired maximum line length when generating YANG tree diagrams
\[[RFC8340](#RFC8340){.xref}\].[¶](#section-5.2-2){.pilcrow}

In another example, some source formats (e.g., YANG
\[[RFC7950](#RFC7950){.xref}\]) allow any quoted string to be broken up
into substrings separated by a concatenation character (e.g., \'+\'),
any of which can be on a different line.[¶](#section-5.2-3){.pilcrow}

It is [RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14} that authors do as much as possible within

## [6.](#section-6){.section-number .selfRef} [Two Folding Strategies](#name-two-folding-strategies){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-two-folding-strategies}

This document defines two nearly identical strategies for folding
text-based content.[¶](#section-6-1){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

The Single Backslash Strategy (\'\\\'):
:   Uses a backslash (\'\\\') character at the end of the line where
    folding occurs, and assumes that the continuation begins at the
    first character that is not a space character (\' \') on the
    following line.[¶](#section-6-2.2){.pilcrow}
:   

The Double Backslash Strategy (\'\\\\\'):
:   Uses a backslash (\'\\\') character at the end of the line where
    folding occurs, and assumes that the continuation begins after a
    second backslash (\'\\\') character on the following
    line.[¶](#section-6-2.4){.pilcrow}
:   

::: {#section-6.1 .section}
### [6.1.](#section-6.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Comparison](#name-comparison){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-comparison}

The first strategy produces output that is more readable. However,
(1) it is significantly more likely to encounter unfoldable input (e.g.,
a long line containing only space characters), and (2) for long lines
that can be folded, automation implementations may encounter scenarios
that, without special care, will produce
errors.[¶](#section-6.1-1){.pilcrow}

The second strategy produces output that is less readable, but it is
unlikely to encounter unfoldable input, there are no long lines that
cannot be folded, and no special care is required when folding a long
line.[¶](#section-6.1-2){.pilcrow}
:::

::: {#section-6.2 .section}
### [6.2.](#section-6.2){.section-number .selfRef} [Recommendation](#name-recommendation){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-recommendation}

It is [RECOMMENDED]{.bcp14} that implementations first attempt to fold
content using the single backslash strategy and, only in the unlikely
event that it cannot fold the input or the folding logic is unable to
cope with a contingency occurring on the desired folding column, then
fall back to the double backslash strategy.[¶](#section-6.2-1){.pilcrow}

The steps are complete, but implementations [MAY]{.bcp14} achieve the
same result in other ways.[¶](#section-7.2-2){.pilcrow}

When a larger document contains multiple instances of text content that
may need to be folded or unfolded, another process must insert⁠/extract
the individual text content instances to/from the larger document prior
to utilizing the algorithms described in this section. For example, the
\'xiax\' utility \[[xiax](#xiax){.xref}\] does
this.[¶](#section-7.2-3){.pilcrow}

Determine the desired maximum line length from input to the
line-wrapping process, such as from a command-line parameter. If no
value is explicitly specified, the value \"69\" [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be
used.[¶](#section-7.2.1-1){.pilcrow}

Ensure that the desired maximum line length is not less than the minimum
header, which is 36 characters. If the desired maximum line length is
less than this minimum, exit (this text-based content cannot be
folded).[¶](#section-7.2.1-2){.pilcrow}

Scan the text content for horizontal tab characters. If any horizontal
tab characters appear, either resolve them to space characters or exit,
forcing the input provider to convert them to space characters
themselves first.[¶](#section-7.2.1-3){.pilcrow}

Scan the text content to ensure that at least one line exceeds the
desired maximum. If no line exceeds the desired maximum, exit (this text
content does not need to be folded).[¶](#section-7.2.1-4){.pilcrow}

Scan the text content to ensure that no existing lines already end with
a backslash (\'\\\') character, as this could lead to an ambiguous
result. If such a line is found, and its width is less than the desired
maximum, then it [SHOULD]{.bcp14} be flagged for \"forced\" folding
(folding even though unnecessary). If the folding implementation
doesn\'t support forced foldings, it [MUST]{.bcp14}
exit.[¶](#section-7.2.1-5){.pilcrow}

If this text content needs to, and can, be folded, insert the header
described in [Section 7.1.1](#single-header){.xref}, ensuring that any
additional printable characters surrounding the header do not result in
a line exceeding the desired maximum.[¶](#section-7.2.1-6){.pilcrow}

For each line in the text content, from top to bottom, if the line
exceeds the desired maximum or requires a forced folding, then fold the
line by performing the following steps:[¶](#section-7.2.1-7){.pilcrow}

1.  [Determine where the fold will occur. This location [MUST]{.bcp14}
    be before or at the desired maximum column and [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} be
    chosen such that the character immediately after the fold is a space
    (\' \') character. For forced foldings, the location is between the
    \'\\\' and the end-of-line sequence. If no such location can be
    found, then exit (this text content cannot be
    folded).[¶](#section-7.2.1-8.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-7.2.1-8.1}
2.  [At the location where the fold is to occur, insert a backslash
    (\'\\\') character followed by the end-of-line character
    sequence.[¶](#section-7.2.1-8.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-7.2.1-8.2}
3.  [On the following line, insert any number of space (\' \')
    characters, provided that the resulting line does not exceed the
    desired
    maximum.[¶](#section-7.2.1-8.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-7.2.1-8.3}

The result of the previous operation is that the next line starts with
an arbitrary number of space (\' \') characters, followed by the
character that was previously occupying the position where the fold
occurred.[¶](#section-7.2.1-9){.pilcrow}

Continue in this manner until reaching the end of the text content. Note
that this algorithm naturally addresses the case where the remainder of
a folded line is still longer than the desired maximum and, hence, needs
to be folded again, ad infinitum.[¶](#section-7.2.1-10){.pilcrow}

\"fold_it_1()\" function in [Appendix

## [Appendix A.](#section-appendix.a){.section-number .selfRef} [Bash Shell Script: rfcfold](#name-bash-shell-script-rfcfold){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-bash-shell-script-rfcfold}

This non-normative appendix includes a Bash shell script
\[[bash](#bash){.xref}\] that can both fold and unfold text content
using both the single and double backslash strategies described in
Sections [7](#single-slash){.xref} and [8](#double-slash){.xref},
respectively. This shell script, called \'rfcfold\', is maintained at
\<<https://github.com/ietf-tools/rfcfold>\>.[¶](#section-appendix.a-1){.pilcrow}

This script is intended to be applied to a single text content instance.
If it is desired to fold or unfold text content instances within a
larger document (e.g., an Internet-Draft or RFC), then another tool must
be used to extract the content from the larger document before utilizing
this script.[¶](#section-appendix.a-2){.pilcrow}

For readability purposes, this script forces the minimum supported line
length to be eight characters longer than the raw header text defined in
Sections [7.1.1](#single-header){.xref} and
[8.1.1](#double-header){.xref} so as to ensure that the header can be
wrapped by a space (\' \') character and three \'equals\' (\'=\')
characters on each side of the raw header
text.[¶](#section-appendix.a-3){.pilcrow}

When a tab character is detected in the input file, this script exits
with the following error message:[¶](#section-appendix.a-4){.pilcrow}

-   [Error: infile contains a tab character, which is not
    allowed.[¶](#section-appendix.a-5.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-appendix.a-5.1}

This script tests for the availability of GNU awk (gawk), in order to
test for ASCII-based control characters and non-ASCII characters in the
input file (see below). Note that testing revealed flaws in the default
version of \'awk\' on some platforms. As this script uses \'gawk\' only
to issue warning messages, if \'gawk\' is not found, this script issues
the following debug message:[¶](#section-appendix.a-6){.pilcrow}

-   [Debug: no GNU awk; skipping checks for special
    characters.[¶](#section-appendix.a-7.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-appendix.a-7.1}

When \'gawk\' is available (see above) and ASCII-based control
characters are detected in the input file, this script issues the
following warning message:[¶](#section-appendix.a-8){.pilcrow}

-   [Warning: infile contains ASCII control characters
    (unsupported).[¶](#section-appendix.a-9.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-appendix.a-9.1}

When \'gawk\' is available (see above) and non-ASCII characters are
detected in the input file, this script issues the following warning
message:[¶](#section-appendix.a-10){.pilcrow}

-   [Warning: infile contains non-ASCII characters
    (unsupported).[¶](#section-appendix.a-11.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-appendix.a-11.1}

This script does not implement the whitespace-avoidance logic described
in [Section 7.2.1](#single-folding){.xref}. In such a case, the script
will exit with the following error
message:[¶](#section-appendix.a-12){.pilcrow}

-   [Error: infile has a space character occurring on the folding
    column. This file cannot be folded using the \'\\\'
    strategy.[¶](#section-appendix.a-13.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-appendix.a-13.1}

While this script can unfold input that contains forced foldings, it is
unable to fold files that would require forced foldings. Forced folding
is described in Sections [7.2.1](#single-folding){.xref} and
[8.2.1](#double-folding){.xref}. When being asked to fold a file that
would require forced folding, the script will instead exit with one of
the following error messages:[¶](#section-appendix.a-14){.pilcrow}

For \'\\\':[¶](#section-appendix.a-15){.pilcrow}

-   [Error: infile has a line ending with a \'\\\' character. This file
    cannot be folded using the \'\\\' strategy without there being false
    positives produced in the unfolding (i.e., this script does not
    force-fold such lines, as described in RFC
    8792).[¶](#section-appendix.a-16.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-appendix.a-16.1}

For \'\\\\\':[¶](#section-appendix.a-17){.pilcrow}

-   [Error: infile has a line ending with a \'\\\' character followed by
    a \'\\\' character as the first non-space character on the next
    line. This script cannot fold this file using the \'\\\\\' strategy
    without there being false positives produced in the unfolding (i.e.,
    this script does not force-fold such lines, as described in RFC
    8792).[¶](#section-appendix.a-18.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-appendix.a-18.1}

Shell-level end-of-line backslash (\'\\\') characters have been
purposely added to the script so as to ensure that the script is itself
not folded in this document, thus simplifying the ability to copy/paste
the script for local use. As should be evident by the lack of the
mandatory header described in [Section 7.1.1](#single-header){.xref},
these backslashes do not designate a folded line (e.g., as described in
[Section 7](#single-slash){.xref}).[¶](#section-appendix.a-19){.pilcrow}
