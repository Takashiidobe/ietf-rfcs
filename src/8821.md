\[[RFC8283](#RFC8283){.xref}\], based on an extension of the PCE
architecture described in \[[RFC4655](#RFC4655){.xref}\], introduced a
broader use applicability for a PCE as a central controller. PCEP
continues to be used as the protocol between the PCE and the Path
Computation Client (PCC). Building on that work, this document describes
a solution of using a PCE for centralized control in a native IP network
to provide end-to-end (E2E) performance assurance and QoS for traffic.
The solution combines the use of distributed routing protocols and a
centralized controller, referred to as Centralized Control Dynamic
Routing (CCDR).[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

\[[RFC8735](#RFC8735){.xref}\] describes the scenarios and simulation
results for traffic engineering in a native IP network based on use of a
CCDR architecture. Per \[[RFC8735](#RFC8735){.xref}\], the architecture
for traffic engineering in a native IP network should meet the following
criteria:[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

-   [Same solution for native IPv4 and IPv6
    traffic.[¶](#section-1-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-3.1}
-   [Support for intra-domain and inter-domain
    scenarios.[¶](#section-1-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-3.2}
-   [Achieve E2E traffic assurance, with determined QoS behavior, for
    traffic requiring a service assurance (prioritized
    traffic).[¶](#section-1-3.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-3.3}
-   [No changes in a router\'s forwarding
    behavior.[¶](#section-1-3.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-3.4}
-   [Based on centralized control through a distributed network control
    plane.[¶](#section-1-3.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-3.5}
-   [Support different network requirements such as high traffic volume
    and prefix scaling.[¶](#section-1-3.6){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-3.6}
-   [Ability to adjust the optimal path dynamically upon the changes of
    network status. No need for reserving resources for physical links
    in advance.[¶](#section-1-3.7){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-3.7}

Building on the above documents, this document defines an architecture
meeting these requirements by using a strategy of multiple BGP sessions
and a PCE as the centralized controller. The architecture depends on the
central control element (PCE) to compute the optimal path and utilizes
the dynamic routing behavior of IGP and BGP for forwarding the
traffic.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

[Figure 1](#fig-ccdr-arch-simple){.xref} illustrates the CCDR
architecture for traffic engineering in a simple topology. The topology
is composed of four devices, which are SW1, SW2, R1, and R2. There are
multiple physical links between R1 and R2. Traffic between prefix PF11
(on SW1) and prefix PF21 (on SW2) is normal traffic; traffic between
prefix PF12 (on SW1) and prefix PF22 (on SW2) is priority traffic that
should be treated accordingly.[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

In the intra-domain scenario, IGP and BGP combined with a PCE are
deployed between R1 and R2. In the inter-domain scenario, only native
BGP is deployed. The traffic between each address pair may change in
real time and the corresponding source/destination addresses of the
traffic may also change dynamically.[¶](#section-3-3){.pilcrow}

The key ideas of the CCDR architecture for this simple topology are the
following:[¶](#section-3-4){.pilcrow}

-   [Build two BGP sessions between R1 and R2 via the different loopback
    addresses on these routers (lo11 and lo12 are the loopback addresses
    of R1, and lo21 and lo22 are the loopback addresses of
    R2).[¶](#section-3-5.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-5.1}
-   [Using the PCE, set the explicit peer route on R1 and R2 for BGP
    next hop to different physical link addresses between R1 and R2. The
    explicit peer route can be set in the format of a static route,
    which is different from the route learned from
    IGP.[¶](#section-3-5.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-5.2}
-   [Send different prefixes via the established BGP sessions. For
    example, send PF11/PF21 via the BGP session 1 and PF12/PF22 via the
    BGP session 2.[¶](#section-3-5.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-3-5.3}

After the above actions, the bidirectional traffic between the PF11 and
PF21, and the bidirectional traffic between PF12 and PF22, will go
through different physical links between R1 and
R2.[¶](#section-3-6){.pilcrow}

If there is more traffic between PF12 and PF22 that needs assured
transport, one can add more physical links between R1 and R2 to reach
the next hop for BGP session 2. In this case, the prefixes that are
advertised by the BGP peers need not be
changed.[¶](#section-3-7){.pilcrow}

If, for example, there is bidirectional priority traffic from another
address pair (for example, prefix PF13/PF23), and the total volume of
priority traffic does not exceed the capacity of the previously
provisioned physical links, one need only advertise the newly added
source/destination prefixes via the BGP session 2. The bidirectional
traffic between PF13/PF23 will go through the same assigned, dedicated
physical links as the traffic between
PF12/PF22.[¶](#section-3-8){.pilcrow}

Such a decoupling philosophy of the IGP/BGP traffic link and the
physical link achieves a flexible control capability for the network
traffic, satisfying the needed QoS assurance to meet the application\'s
requirement. The router needs only to support native IP and multiple BGP
sessions set up via different loopback
addresses.[¶](#section-3-9){.pilcrow}
:::

::: {#section-4 .section}
## [4.](#section-4){.section-number .selfRef} [CCDR Architecture in a Large-Scale Topology](#name-ccdr-architecture-in-a-larg){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-ccdr-architecture-in-a-larg}

When the priority traffic spans a large-scale network, such as that
illustrated in [Figure 2](#fig-ccdr-arch-large){.xref}, the multiple BGP
sessions cannot be established hop by hop within one autonomous system.
For such a scenario, we propose using a Route Reflector (RR)
\[[RFC4456](#RFC4456){.xref}\] to achieve a similar effect. Every edge
router will establish two BGP sessions with the RR via different
loopback addresses respectively. The other steps for traffic
differentiation are the same as that described in the CCDR architecture
for the simple topology.[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

As shown in [Figure 2](#fig-ccdr-arch-large){.xref}, if we select R3 as
the RR, every edge router (R1 and R7 in this example) will build two BGP
sessions with the RR. If the PCE selects the dedicated path as
R1-R2-R4-R7, then the operator should set the explicit peer routes via
PCEP on these routers respectively, pointing to the BGP next hop
(loopback addresses of R1 and R7, which are used to send the prefix of
the priority traffic) to the selected forwarding
address.[¶](#section-4-2){.pilcrow}

Generally, different applications may require different QoS criteria,
which may include:[¶](#section-5-1){.pilcrow}

-   [Traffic that requires low latency and is not sensitive to packet
    loss.[¶](#section-5-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-5-2.1}
-   [Traffic that requires low packet loss and can endure higher

-   [Traffic that requires low
    jitter.[¶](#section-5-2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-5-2.3}

For Prefix Set No.1, we can select the shortest distance path to carry
the traffic; for Prefix Set No.2, we can select the path that has E2E
under-loaded links; for Prefix Set No.3, we can let traffic pass over a
determined single path, as no ECMP distribution on the parallel links is
desired.[¶](#section-5-5){.pilcrow}

It is almost impossible to provide an E2E path efficiently with latency,
jitter, and packet loss constraints to meet the above requirements in a
large-scale, IP-based network only using a distributed routing protocol,
but these requirements can be met with the assistance of PCE, as
described in \[[RFC4655](#RFC4655){.xref}\] and
\[[RFC8283](#RFC8283){.xref}\]. The PCE will have the overall network
view, ability to collect the real-time network topology, and the network
performance information about the underlying network. The PCE can select
the appropriate path to meet the various network performance
requirements for different traffic.[¶](#section-5-6){.pilcrow}

The architecture to implement the CCDR multiple BGP sessions strategy is
as follows:[¶](#section-5-7){.pilcrow}

The PCE will be responsible for the optimal path computation for the
different priority classes of traffic:[¶](#section-5-8){.pilcrow}

-   [PCE collects topology information via BGP-LS
    \[[RFC7752](#RFC7752){.xref}\] and link utilization information via
    the existing Network Monitoring System (NMS) from the underlying
    network.[¶](#section-5-9.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-5-9.1}
-   [PCE calculates the appropriate path based upon the application\'s
    requirements and sends the key parameters to edge/RR routers (R1,
    R7, and R3 in [Figure 3](#fig-ccdr-arch-multi){.xref}) to establish
    multiple BGP sessions. The loopback addresses used for the BGP
    sessions should be planned in advance and distributed in the
    domain.[¶](#section-5-9.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-5-9.2}
-   [PCE sends the route information to the routers (R1, R2, R4, and R7
    in [Figure 3](#fig-ccdr-arch-multi){.xref}) on the forwarding path
    via PCEP to build the path to the BGP next hop of the advertised
    prefixes. The path to these BGP next hops will also be learned via
    IGP, but the route from the PCEP has the higher preference. Such a
    design can assure the IGP path to the BGP next hop can be used to
    protect the path assigned by
    PCE.[¶](#section-5-9.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-5-9.3}
-   [PCE sends the prefix information to the PCC (edge routers that have
    established BGP sessions) for advertising different prefixes via the
    specified BGP session.[¶](#section-5-9.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-5-9.4}
-   [The priority traffic may share some links or nodes if the path the
    shared links or nodes can meet the requirement of application. When
    the priority traffic prefixes are changed, but the total volume of
    priority traffic does not exceed the physical capacity of the
    previous E2E path, the PCE needs only change the prefixes advertised
    via the edge routers (R1 and R7 in [Figure
    3](#fig-ccdr-arch-multi){.xref}).[¶](#section-5-9.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-5-9.5}

## [6.](#section-6){.section-number .selfRef} [PCEP Extension for Critical Parameters Delivery](#name-pcep-extension-for-critical){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-pcep-extension-for-critical}

PCEP needs to be extended to transfer the following critical
parameters:[¶](#section-6-1){.pilcrow}

-   [Peer information that is used to build the BGP
    session.[¶](#section-6-2.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-6-2.1}
-   [Explicit route information for BGP next hop of advertised
    prefixes.[¶](#section-6-2.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-6-2.2}
-   [Advertised prefixes and their associated BGP
    session.[¶](#section-6-2.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-6-2.3}

Once the router receives such information, it should establish the BGP
session with the peer appointed in the PCEP message, build the E2E
dedicated path hop by hop, and advertise the prefixes that are contained
in the corresponding PCEP message.[¶](#section-6-3){.pilcrow}

The dedicated path is preferred by making sure that the explicit route
created by PCE has the higher priority (lower route preference) than the
route information created by other dynamic
protocols.[¶](#section-6-4){.pilcrow}

All of the above dynamically created states (BGP sessions, explicit
routes, and advertised prefixes) will be cleared on the expiration of
the state timeout interval, which is based on the existing stateful PCE
\[[RFC8231](#RFC8231){.xref}\] and PCE as a Central Controller (PCECC)
\[[RFC8283](#RFC8283){.xref}\] mechanism.[¶](#section-6-5){.pilcrow}

Regarding the BGP session, it is not different from that configured
manually or via Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) and YANG.
Different BGP sessions are used mainly for the clarification of the
network prefixes, which can be differentiated via the different BGP next
hop. Based on this strategy, if we manipulate the path to the BGP next
hop, then the path to the prefixes that were advertised with the BGP
sessions will be changed accordingly. Details of communications between
PCEP and BGP subsystems in the router\'s control plane are out of scope
of this document.[¶](#section-6-6){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-7.1 .section}
### [7.1.](#section-7.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Scalability](#name-scalability){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-scalability}

In the CCDR architecture, only the edge routers that connect with the
PCE are responsible for the prefix advertisement via the multiple BGP
sessions deployment. The route information for these prefixes within the
on-path routers is distributed via BGP.[¶](#section-7.1-1){.pilcrow}

For multiple domain deployment, the PCE, or the pool of PCEs responsible
for these domains, needs only to control the edge router to build the
multiple External BGP (EBGP) sessions; all other procedures are the same
as within one domain.[¶](#section-7.1-2){.pilcrow}

The on-path router needs only to keep the specific policy routes for the
BGP next hop of the differentiated prefixes, not the specific routes to
the prefixes themselves. This lessens the burden of the table size of
policy-based routes for the on-path routers; and has more expandability
compared with BGP Flowspec or OpenFlow solutions. For example, if we
want to differentiate 1,000 prefixes from the normal traffic, CCDR needs
only one explicit peer route in every on-path router, whereas the BGP
Flowspec or OpenFlow solutions need 1,000 policy routes on
them.[¶](#section-7.1-3){.pilcrow}
:::

::: {#section-7.2 .section}
### [7.2.](#section-7.2){.section-number .selfRef} [High Availability](#name-high-availability){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-high-availability}

The CCDR architecture is based on the use of native IP. If the PCE
fails, the forwarding plane will not be impacted, as the BGP sessions
between all the devices will not flap, and the forwarding table remains
unchanged.[¶](#section-7.2-1){.pilcrow}

If one node on the optimal path fails, the priority traffic will fall
over to the best-effort forwarding path. One can even design several
paths to load balance or to create a hot standby of the priority traffic
to meet a path failure situation.[¶](#section-7.2-2){.pilcrow}

For ensuring high availability of a PCE/SDN-controllers architecture, an
operator should rely on existing high availability solutions for SDN
controllers, such as clustering technology and
deployment.[¶](#section-7.2-3){.pilcrow}
:::

::: {#section-7.3 .section}
### [7.3.](#section-7.3){.section-number .selfRef} [Incremental Deployment](#name-incremental-deployment){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-incremental-deployment}

Not every router within the network needs to support the necessary PCEP
extension. For such situations, routers on the edge of a domain can be
upgraded first, and then the traffic can be prioritized between
different domains. Within each domain, the traffic will be forwarded
along the best-effort path. A service provider can selectively upgrade
the routers on each domain in sequence.[¶](#section-7.3-1){.pilcrow}

::: {#section-7.4 .section}
### [7.4.](#section-7.4){.section-number .selfRef} [Loop Avoidance](#name-loop-avoidance){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-loop-avoidance}

A PCE needs to assure calculation of the E2E path based on the status of
network and the service requirements in
real-time.[¶](#section-7.4-1){.pilcrow}

The PCE needs to consider the explicit route deployment order (for
example, from tail router to head router) to eliminate any possible
transient traffic loop.[¶](#section-7.4-2){.pilcrow}

It is necessary to deploy the corresponding E2E path performance
monitoring mechanism to assure that the delay, jitter, or packet loss
index meets the original path performance aim. The performance
monitoring results should provide feedback to the PCE in order for it to
accomplish the re-optimization process and send the update control
message to the related PCC if necessary. Traditional OAM methods (ping,
trace) can be used.[¶](#section-7.5-1){.pilcrow}

## [8.](#section-8){.section-number .selfRef} [Security Considerations](#name-security-considerations){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-security-considerations}

The setup of BGP sessions, prefix advertisement, and explicit peer route
establishment are all controlled by the PCE. See
\[[RFC4271](#RFC4271){.xref}\] and \[[RFC4272](#RFC4272){.xref}\] for
BGP security considerations. The Security Considerations found in
[Section 10](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5440#section-10){.relref}
of \[[RFC5440](#RFC5440){.xref}\] and [Section
10](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8231#section-10){.relref} of
\[[RFC8231](#RFC8231){.xref}\] should be considered. To prevent a bogus
PCE sending harmful messages to the network nodes, the network devices
should authenticate the validity of the PCE and ensure a secure
communication channel between them. Mechanisms described in
\[[RFC8253](#RFC8253){.xref}\] should be
used.[¶](#section-8-1){.pilcrow}

The CCDR architecture does not require changes to the forwarding
behavior of the underlay devices. There are no additional security
impacts on these devices.[¶](#section-8-2){.pilcrow}
