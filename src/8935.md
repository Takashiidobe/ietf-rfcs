# RFC 8935 {#rfcnum}

# Push-Based Security Event Token (SET) Delivery Using HTTP {#title}

::: {#section-abstract .section}
## [Abstract](#abstract){.selfRef}

This specification defines how a Security Event Token (SET) can be
delivered to an intended recipient using HTTP POST over TLS. The SET is
transmitted in the body of an HTTP POST request to an endpoint operated
by the recipient, and the recipient indicates successful or failed
transmission via the HTTP response.[¶](#section-abstract-1){.pilcrow}

## [1.](#section-1){.section-number .selfRef} [Introduction and Overview](#name-introduction-and-overview){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-introduction-and-overview}

This specification defines a mechanism by which a transmitter of a
[Security Event Token (SET)](#RFC8417){.xref}
\[[RFC8417](#RFC8417){.xref}\] can deliver the SET to an intended SET
Recipient via [HTTP POST](#RFC7231){.xref}
\[[RFC7231](#RFC7231){.xref}\] over TLS. This is an alternative SET
delivery method to the one defined in
\[[RFC8936](#RFC8936){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-1){.pilcrow}

Push-based SET delivery over HTTP POST is intended for scenarios where
all of the following apply:[¶](#section-1-2){.pilcrow}

-   [The transmitter of the SET is capable of making outbound HTTP
    requests.[¶](#section-1-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-3.1}
-   [The recipient is capable of hosting a TLS-enabled HTTP endpoint
    that is accessible to the
    transmitter.[¶](#section-1-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-3.2}
-   [The transmitter and recipient are willing to exchange data with one
    another.[¶](#section-1-3.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-1-3.3}

In some scenarios, either push-based or poll-based delivery could be
used, and in others, only one of them would be
applicable.[¶](#section-1-4){.pilcrow}

A mechanism for exchanging configuration metadata such as endpoint URLs,
cryptographic keys, and possible implementation constraints such as
buffer size limitations between the transmitter and recipient is out of
scope for this specification. How SETs are defined and the process by
which security events are identified for SET Recipients are specified in
\[[RFC8417](#RFC8417){.xref}\].[¶](#section-1-5){.pilcrow}

This specification utilizes the following terms defined in
\[[RFC8417](#RFC8417){.xref}\]: \"Security Event Token (SET)\", \"SET
Issuer\", \"SET Recipient\", and \"Event Payload\", as well as the term
defined below:[¶](#section-1.2-1){.pilcrow}

[]{.break}

SET Transmitter:
:   An entity that delivers SETs in its possession to one or more SET
    Recipients.[¶](#section-1.2-2.2){.pilcrow}

::: {#Delivery}
::: {#section-2 .section}
## [2.](#section-2){.section-number .selfRef} [SET Delivery](#name-set-delivery){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-set-delivery}

To deliver a SET to a given SET Recipient, the SET Transmitter makes a
SET Transmission Request to the SET Recipient, with the SET itself
contained within the request. The SET Recipient replies to this request
with a response either acknowledging successful transmission of the SET
or indicating that an error occurred while receiving, parsing, and/or
validating the SET.[¶](#section-2-1){.pilcrow}

Upon receipt of a SET, the SET Recipient [SHALL]{.bcp14} validate that
all of the following are true:[¶](#section-2-2){.pilcrow}

-   [The SET Recipient can parse the
    SET.[¶](#section-2-3.1){.pilcrow}]{#section-2-3.1}
-   [The SET is authentic (i.e., it was issued by the issuer specified
    within the SET, and if signed, was signed by a key belonging to the
    issuer).[¶](#section-2-3.2){.pilcrow}]{#section-2-3.2}
-   [The SET Recipient is identified as an intended audience of the
    SET.[¶](#section-2-3.3){.pilcrow}]{#section-2-3.3}
-   [The SET Issuer is recognized as an issuer that the SET Recipient is
    willing to receive SETs from (e.g., the issuer is listed as allowed
    by the SET Recipient).[¶](#section-2-3.4){.pilcrow}]{#section-2-3.4}
-   [The SET Recipient is willing to accept this SET from this SET
    Transmitter (e.g., the SET Transmitter is expected to send SETs with
    the issuer and subject of the SET in
    question).[¶](#section-2-3.5){.pilcrow}]{#section-2-3.5}

The mechanisms by which the SET Recipient performs this validation are
out of scope for this document. SET parsing, issuer identification, and
audience identification are defined in \[[RFC8417](#RFC8417){.xref}\].
The mechanism for validating the authenticity of a SET is deployment
specific and may vary depending on the authentication mechanisms in use
and whether the SET is signed and/or encrypted (See [Section
3](#aa){.xref}).[¶](#section-2-4){.pilcrow}

SET Transmitters [MAY]{.bcp14} transmit SETs issued by another entity.
The SET Recipient may accept or reject (i.e., return an error response
such as `access_denied`) a SET at its own
discretion.[¶](#section-2-5){.pilcrow}

The SET Recipient persists the SET in a way that is sufficient to meet
the SET Recipient\'s own reliability requirements. The level and method
of retention of SETs by SET Recipients is out of scope of this
specification. Once the SET has been validated and persisted, the SET
Recipient [SHOULD]{.bcp14} immediately return a response indicating that
the SET was successfully delivered. The SET Recipient [SHOULD
NOT]{.bcp14} perform further processing of the SET beyond the required
validation steps prior to sending this response. Any additional steps
[SHOULD]{.bcp14} be executed asynchronously from delivery to minimize
the time the SET Transmitter is waiting for a
response.[¶](#section-2-6){.pilcrow}

The SET Transmitter [MAY]{.bcp14} transmit the same SET to the SET
Recipient multiple times, regardless of the response from the SET
Recipient. The SET Recipient [MUST]{.bcp14} respond as it would if the
SET had not been previously received by the SET Recipient. The SET
Recipient [MUST NOT]{.bcp14} expect or depend on a SET Transmitter to
retransmit a SET or otherwise make a SET available to the SET Recipient
once the SET Recipient acknowledges that it was received
successfully.[¶](#section-2-7){.pilcrow}

The SET Transmitter should not retransmit a SET unless the SET
Transmitter suspects that previous transmissions may have failed due to
potentially recoverable errors (such as network outage or temporary
service interruption at either the SET Transmitter or SET Recipient). In
all other cases, the SET Transmitter [SHOULD NOT]{.bcp14} retransmit a
SET. The SET Transmitter [SHOULD]{.bcp14} delay retransmission for an
appropriate amount of time to avoid overwhelming the SET Recipient (see
[Section 4](#reliability){.xref}).[¶](#section-2-8){.pilcrow}

### [2.1.](#section-2.1){.section-number .selfRef} [Transmitting a SET](#name-transmitting-a-set){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-transmitting-a-set}

To transmit a SET to a SET Recipient, the SET Transmitter makes an HTTP
POST request to a TLS-enabled HTTP endpoint provided by the SET
Recipient. The `Content-Type` header field of this request
[MUST]{.bcp14} be `application/secevent+jwt` as defined in Sections
[2.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8417#section-2.3){.relref} and
[7.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8417#section-7.2){.relref} of
\[[RFC8417](#RFC8417){.xref}\], and the `Accept` header field
[MUST]{.bcp14} be `application/json`. The request body [MUST]{.bcp14}
consist of the SET itself, represented as a [JSON Web Token
(JWT)](#RFC7519){.xref}
\[[RFC7519](#RFC7519){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2.1-1){.pilcrow}

The SET Transmitter [MAY]{.bcp14} include in the request an
`Accept-Language` header field to indicate to the SET Recipient the
preferred language(s) in which to receive error
messages.[¶](#section-2.1-2){.pilcrow}

The mechanisms by which the SET Transmitter determines the HTTP endpoint
to use when transmitting a SET to a given SET Recipient are not defined
by this specification and are deployment
specific.[¶](#section-2.1-3){.pilcrow}

The following is a non-normative example of a SET Transmission
Request:[¶](#section-2.1-4){.pilcrow}

If the SET is determined to be valid, the SET Recipient [SHALL]{.bcp14}
acknowledge successful transmission by responding with HTTP Response

In the event of a general HTTP error condition, the SET Recipient
responds with the applicable HTTP Status Code, as defined in [Section
6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7231#section-6){.relref} of
\[[RFC7231](#RFC7231){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2.3-1){.pilcrow}

When the SET Recipient detects an error parsing, validating, or
authenticating a SET transmitted in a SET Transmission Request, the SET
Recipient [SHALL]{.bcp14} respond with an HTTP Response Status Code of
400 (Bad Request). The `Content-Type` header field of this response
[MUST]{.bcp14} be `application/json`, and the body [MUST]{.bcp14} be a
UTF-8 encoded [JSON](#RFC8259){.xref} \[[RFC8259](#RFC8259){.xref}\]
object containing the following name/value
pairs:[¶](#section-2.3-2){.pilcrow}

    that may provide additional diagnostic information. The exact
    content of this field is implementation
    specific.[¶](#section-2.3-3.4){.pilcrow}
:   

The response [MUST]{.bcp14} include a `Content-Language` header field
whose value indicates the language of the error descriptions included in
the response body. If the SET Recipient can provide error descriptions
in multiple languages, they [SHOULD]{.bcp14} choose the language to use
according to the value of the `Accept-Language` header field sent by the
SET Transmitter in the transmission request, as described in [Section
5.3.5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7231#section-5.3.5){.relref} of
\[[RFC7231](#RFC7231){.xref}\]. If the SET Transmitter did not send an
`Accept-Language` header field, or if the SET Recipient does not support
any of the languages included in the header field, the SET Recipient
[MUST]{.bcp14} respond with messages that are understandable by an
English-speaking person, as described in [Section
4.5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2277#section-4.5){.relref} of
\[[RFC2277](#RFC2277){.xref}\].[¶](#section-2.3-4){.pilcrow}

## [3.](#section-3){.section-number .selfRef} [Authentication and Authorization](#name-authentication-and-authoriz){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-authentication-and-authoriz}

The SET delivery method described in this specification is based upon
HTTP over TLS \[[RFC2818](#RFC2818){.xref}\] and standard HTTP
authentication and authorization schemes, as per
\[[RFC7235](#RFC7235){.xref}\]. The TLS server certificate
[MUST]{.bcp14} be validated using DNS-ID \[[RFC6125](#RFC6125){.xref}\]
and/or DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE)
\[[RFC6698](#RFC6698){.xref}\].[¶](#section-3-1){.pilcrow}

Authorization for the eligibility to provide actionable SETs can be
determined by using the identity of the SET Issuer, the identity of the
SET Transmitter, perhaps using mutual TLS, or via other employed
authentication methods. Because SETs are not commands, SET Recipients
are free to ignore SETs that are not of
interest.[¶](#section-3-2){.pilcrow}

::: {#reliability}
::: {#section-4 .section}
## [4.](#section-4){.section-number .selfRef} [Delivery Reliability](#name-delivery-reliability){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-delivery-reliability}

Delivery reliability requirements may vary depending upon the use cases.
This specification defines the response from the SET Recipient in such a
way as to provide the SET Transmitter with the information necessary to
determine what further action is required, if any, in order to meet
their requirements. SET Transmitters with high reliability requirements
may be tempted to always retry failed transmissions. However, it should
be noted that for many types of SET delivery errors, a retry is
extremely unlikely to be successful. For example, `invalid_request`
indicates a structural error in the content of the request body that is
likely to remain when retransmitting the same SET. Others such as
`access_denied` may be transient, for example, if the SET Transmitter
refreshes expired credentials prior to
retransmission.[¶](#section-4-1){.pilcrow}

The SET Transmitter may be unaware of whether or not a SET has been
delivered to a SET Recipient. For example, a network interruption could
prevent the SET Transmitter from receiving the success response, or a
service outage could prevent the SET Transmitter from recording the fact
that the SET was delivered. It is left to the implementer to decide how
to handle such cases, based on their requirements. For example, it may
be appropriate for the SET Transmitter to retransmit the SET to the SET
Recipient, erring on the side of guaranteeing delivery, or it may be
appropriate to assume delivery was successful, erring on the side of not
spending resources retransmitting previously delivered SETs. Other
options, such as sending the SET to a \"dead letter queue\" for manual
examination may also be appropriate.[¶](#section-4-2){.pilcrow}

Implementers [SHOULD]{.bcp14} evaluate the reliability requirements of
their use cases and the impact of various retry mechanisms and
retransmission policies on the performance of their systems to determine
an appropriate strategy for handling various error
conditions.[¶](#section-4-3){.pilcrow}

SETs may contain sensitive information, including Personally
Identifiable Information (PII), or be distributed through third parties.
In such cases, SET Transmitters and SET Recipients [MUST]{.bcp14}
protect the confidentiality of the SET contents. TLS [MUST]{.bcp14} be
used to secure the transmitted SETs. In some use cases, encrypting the
SET as described in [JWE](#RFC7516){.xref}
\[[RFC7516](#RFC7516){.xref}\] will also be required. The Event delivery
endpoint [MUST]{.bcp14} support at least TLS version 1.2
\[[RFC5246](#RFC5246){.xref}\] and [SHOULD]{.bcp14} support the newest
version of TLS that meets its security requirements, which as of the
time of this publication is TLS 1.3 \[[RFC8446](#RFC8446){.xref}\]. The

DNS-ID \[[RFC6125](#RFC6125){.xref}\] and/or DANE
\[[RFC6698](#RFC6698){.xref}\]. How a SET Transmitter determines the
expected service identity to match the SET Recipient\'s server

The SET Recipient may be vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack where
a malicious party makes a high volume of requests containing invalid
SETs, causing the endpoint to expend significant resources on
cryptographic operations that are bound to fail. This may be mitigated
by authenticating SET Transmitters with a mechanism such as mutual TLS.
Rate-limiting problematic transmitters is also a possible means of
mitigation.[¶](#section-5.4-1){.pilcrow}

At the time of receipt, the SET Recipient can rely upon TLS mechanisms,
HTTP authentication methods, and/or other context from the transmission
request to authenticate the SET Transmitter and validate the
authenticity of the SET. However, this context is typically unavailable
to systems to which the SET Recipient forwards the SET, or to systems
that retrieve the SET from storage. If the SET Recipient requires the
ability to validate SET authenticity outside of the context of the
transmission request, then the SET Recipient [SHOULD]{.bcp14} ensure
that such SETs have been signed in accordance with
\[[RFC7515](#RFC7515){.xref}\]. Needed context could also be stored with
the SET and retrieved with it.[¶](#section-5.5-1){.pilcrow}

SET Transmitters should attempt to deliver SETs that are targeted to the
specific business and protocol needs of
subscribers.[¶](#section-6-1){.pilcrow}

When sharing personally identifiable information or information that is
otherwise considered confidential to affected users, SET Transmitters
and Recipients [MUST]{.bcp14} have the appropriate legal agreements and
user consent or terms of service in place. Furthermore, data that needs
confidentiality protection [MUST]{.bcp14} be encrypted, at least with
TLS and sometimes also using JSON Web Encryption (JWE)
\[[RFC7516](#RFC7516){.xref}\].[¶](#section-6-2){.pilcrow}

In some cases, subject identifiers themselves may be considered
sensitive information, such that their inclusion within a SET may be
considered a violation of privacy. SET Issuers and SET Transmitters
should consider the ramifications of sharing a particular subject
identifier with a SET Recipient (e.g., whether doing so could enable
correlation and/or de-anonymization of data) and choose appropriate
subject identifiers for their use cases.[¶](#section-6-3){.pilcrow}

This document defines Security Event Token Error Codes, for which IANA
has created and now maintains a new registry titled \"Security Event
Token Error Codes\". Initial values for the \"Security Event Token Error
Codes\" registry are defined in [Table 1](#reqErrors){.xref} and
registered below. Future assignments are to be made through the
Specification Required registration policy
\[[RFC8126](#RFC8126){.xref}\] and shall follow the template
below.[¶](#section-7.1-1){.pilcrow}

Error Codes are intended to be interpreted by automated systems;
therefore, they [SHOULD]{.bcp14} identify classes of errors to which an
automated system could respond in a meaningfully distinct way (e.g., by
refreshing authentication credentials and retrying the
request).[¶](#section-7.1-2){.pilcrow}

Error Code names are case sensitive. Names may not match other
registered names in a case-insensitive manner unless the Designated
Experts state that there is a compelling reason to allow an
exception.[¶](#section-7.1-3){.pilcrow}

Criteria that should be applied by the Designated Experts includes
determining whether the proposed registration duplicates existing
functionality, whether it is likely to be of general applicability or
whether it is useful only for a single application, and whether the
registration description is clear.[¶](#section-7.1-4){.pilcrow}

It is suggested that multiple Designated Experts be appointed who are
able to represent the perspectives of different applications using this
specification in order to enable broadly informed review of registration
decisions. In cases where a registration decision could be perceived as
creating a conflict of interest for a particular expert, that expert
should defer to the judgment of the other
experts.[¶](#section-7.1-5){.pilcrow}

## [Appendix A.](#section-appendix.a){.section-number .selfRef} [Unencrypted Transport Considerations](#name-unencrypted-transport-consi){.section-name .selfRef} {#name-unencrypted-transport-consi}

Earlier versions of this specification made the use of TLS optional and
described security and privacy considerations resulting from use of
unencrypted HTTP as the underlying transport. When the working group
decided to mandate usage of HTTP over TLS, it also decided to preserve
the description of these considerations in this non-normative
appendix.[¶](#section-appendix.a-1){.pilcrow}

SETs may contain sensitive information that is considered Personally
Identifiable Information (PII). In such cases, SET Transmitters and SET
Recipients [MUST]{.bcp14} protect the confidentiality of the SET
contents. When TLS is not used, this means that the SET [MUST]{.bcp14}
be encrypted as described in [JWE](#RFC7516){.xref}
\[[RFC7516](#RFC7516){.xref}\].[¶](#section-appendix.a-2){.pilcrow}

If SETs were allowed to be transmitted over unencrypted channels, some
privacy-sensitive information about them might leak, even though the
SETs themselves are encrypted. For instance, an attacker may be able to
determine whether or not a SET was accepted and the reason for its
rejection or may be able to derive information from being able to
observe the size of the encrypted SET. (Note that even when TLS is
utilized, some information leakage is still possible; message padding
algorithms to prevent side channels remain an open research
topic.)[¶](#section-appendix.a-3){.pilcrow}
